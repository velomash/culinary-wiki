First breakfast is for us. Quiet, private, solitary. A cup of coffee and a lonely banana. Second breakfast happens when we
get to work. Social, engaging, and sometimes more substantial. This meal is not new. It descends from European customs, 
most notably German gabelfrustuck, or "fork breakfast." The French, Viennese, and Russians traditionally incorporate
second breakfast into their daily meal plan.
<p>
<b>What time is second breakfast?</b><br>
Generally around 10AM. The fact this timing coincides with standard USA morning coffee break
is not by accident. Business managers in the early 20th century saw they were losing productivity when their workers ducked off
premesis for coffee and rolls. Up sprung company cafeterias, staff kitchens, mobile catering trucks, and lobby carts.
<p>
<b>Why do we eat it?</b><br>
Because we're hungry! Second breakfast is provided to school children because studies show improved learning outcomes. We also
eat second breakfast when we're not hungy. Campaigning politicians make several stops daily. If well planned, they
can fit in 2nd or 3rd breakfast before lunch. It is important to note: research indicates people who eat second breakfast do not
necessarily eat more than people who stick to the "basic three" meals a day. They just eat less at each meal. The person who
skips breakfast(s) is more likely to eat a heavier lunch and dinner.
<p>
<b>Who eats second breakfast?</b><br>
This meal cut across all socio-economic lines. Business people, farmers, factory workers, school children, hikers, politicians, soldiers, models & 
movie stars traditionally consume this meal. Vacationers often take coffee in their rooms before venturing forth
to hotel breakfast bar.
<p>
<b>What do we eat?</b><br>
While traditional Europeans consider this a more substantial meal than first breakfast, we Americans
are all over the map. We can actually eat the same thing we did for first breakfast. We can also incorporate energy bars,
hot fast food sandwiches, full-on eggs, bacon & pancakes or a slice of cold pizza. 
<p>
<b>We wonder:</b> If you don't eat first breakfast are you eligible for a second? 
<p>
<i>The Oxford English Dictionary</i> defines "second breakfast" this way:<br> 
second breakfast n. a light meal taken late in the morning or early in the afternoon. <br>
1775 J. Woodforde Diary 2 Jan. (1924) I. 144 We stayed at Whitney and made a second breakfast, we treated the maid at 
Whitney. <br>
1802 M. Nugent Jrnl. 15 Jan. (1907) ii. 72 Had fruit for the children at 10; then second breakfast a little after 11.—
Dined at 3. <br>
1967 O. Hesky Time for Treason xi. 83 Barzilai was regretting that he hadn't utilised this period by having a ‘second breakfast’, a habit dear to the stomachs of those raised in certain parts of Europe.

"On our way we called on the Marshal, and took a second breakfast with him." <br>
---"Buonaparte," extract from a letter written by an officer of his Majesty's ship Newcastle to his friend in London, <i>The Courier</i> [London],

<b>[1875] </b>
"During the trial which has just taken place before the Paris Court of Appeals the following document, being a contract between the 
steward of the ex-Queen of Spain and the cook to the Royal household, was read:...The ordinary service (chocolate expected) is 
understood to comprise the breakfast, second breakfast, and dinner of her Majesty...The second breakfast is to consist of five dishes, 
besides soup, fruits, cheese, and preserves." <br>
---"The Household of Queen Isabella," <i>The Week's News</i>, [London], August 28, 1875 (p. 1103) 
<p>

"Early hours are kept in the household; nobody is out of bed after 10 at night, and M. Taine is at work in his study by 7 in the 
morning. Before the first breakfast, at 8:30, he has written several pages of manuscript; before the second breakfast, at 11, he has performed a good day's 
work. After the latter meal he is ready to take a walk in his garden...At the second breakfast, which is an ordinary English 
breakfast and luncheon combined...The second breakfast and dinner are the two occasions when the family meet together during the day, 
and they afford convenient opportunities for conversing about subjects of general or personal interest." <br>
---"M. Taine and His Family," <i>London World</i>, January 27, 1880 (p. 2) 
<p>
<b>[1891] </b><br>
"American breakfasts partaken of between 8 and 9 o'clock have long been the subject of more ore less disagreeable criticism on 
the part of foreigners. Frenchmen in particular, shrug their shoulders and spread their palms over d'jeuner a l'Americain. They are 
willing to accord much of our national nervousness to this habit we have of breaking our night's fast with a long and heavy list of 
edibles. It is, however, hot realized how widely the foreign fashion of a 'tray breakfast' obtains new in private houses in New-York. In 
many such, a dish of fruit, with a roll and coffee, is all that is served, and this is usually carried to the person. Eevn if it 
is preferred to meet about a common board no more elaborate menu is presented. The second breakfast, at 12 o'clock, is prompt in 
its appearance prodigal in its nature, combining the breakfast grille with the luncheon salad. In country houses and watering-place 
cottage life the custom is now as persistent that it is accepted as universal. The practice is one recommended by physician and students 
of hygienic laws." <br>
---"Her Point of View," <i>New York Times</i>, June 4, 1891 (p. 12) [NOTE: This "second breakfast" resounds of 
<a href="http://foodtimeline.org/fodfaq7.html#ukbrunch">Brunch</a>, a term allegedly coined in 1895
<p>
<b>[1899]</b><br> 
"Some Americans complain they have no appetite for breakfast. Then do not eat any. Whole nations do not eat any substantial breakfast 
before 10 or 11 o'clock. The Germans and the French both take something very light--a cup of coffee, chocolate or milk and a roll, and later take 
a hearty meal. The Germans call it a second breakfast, and the French, 'breakfast with a fork.' The Americans think that something is 
wrong if they do not want a heavy meal the first thing, and force it down when they would be much better off without it 
until hours later." <br>

"President Taft will be Boston's guest in the celebration of St .Patrick's Day. Upon his arrival at the South Station about 7 
o'clock to-morrow morning President Taft will be escorted by Mayer Fitzgerald and Samuel J. Elder to the City Club, and after a 'continental' 
breakfast will receive the club members. The President will be the guest of the city at a second breakfast at 9:30." <br>
---<i>New York Times</i>, March 18, 1912 (p. 5) 
<p>
<b>[1913] </b><br>
"We're always late to breakfast. You know that variety of guest and so do I!...I may be mistaken, but I have a strong prejudice in 
favor of the family all getting to the breakfast table within a reasonable length of time after the meal is announced. Promptness 
means an unspoiled repast, the leisure to eat comfortably, the absence of gulping and consequent indigestion which are unavoidable for 
train-catchers and school-goers who are late at breakfast. Although my guests were aware of my opinions on this matter they were never 
on time once during the fortnight they spent under our room. In vain did I ask them at bed-time the hour at which they would be 
ready for breakfast and fix it to suit their desires, even taking the trouble to have prepared and served two meals--one for those who 
had appointments to keep, and the other for our luxurious visitors. The second breakfast dried and spoiled while I awaited the young 
pair and my only course was to put the porridge in a double boiler at the back of the stove, leave the fruit in its place on the 
dismantled and re-set table and then have coffee, toast, and eggs cooked after the belated ones were actually seated at the board. Did they show 
mortification or distress? Not for a minute!" <br>

jam." <br>

"With the reasonably generous breakfast of the American family, the lunch or supper is likely to be moderate and the dinner generous. 
On the other hand, it is natural enough that with the light breakfast of continental Europe there should go either the second 
breakfast and supper or the hearty lunch as well as the dinner. Apparently the number of meals take does not greatly influence the 
amount eaten per day, for the man who goes without his breakfast is very likely to make up for it at dinner or supper, while the 
man who eats an early breakfast and then a second breakfast will be likely to take a moderate lunch or a light dinner. Good food 
habits do not permit of gluttony." <br>
---"Good Food Habits," <i>The Pointer</i> [Dolton IL], August 4, 1916 (p. 3) 
<p>
<b>[1920] </b><br>
"Because the neighborhood house workers found it so difficult to induce the mothers to change the coffee diet to nourishing 
milk and cereals, the 'supplementary breakfast' was instituted. Then the system was expanded and each child was given, in addition to 
breakfast, a nourishing luncheon and midafternoon crackers and milk."<br> 
---"Delicate Children Aided: Malnutrition Class Organized at the Greenwich House," <i>New York Times</i>, September 12, 1920 (p. E8) 
<p>

"The supplementary breakfast promises to become an accepted adjunct of the gastronomic program of this metropolis. Ten o' 
clock coffee is rapidly achieving the prevalence--possibly the social significance--of the 5 o'clock tea. If is a far more 
leisurely repast than the orthodox breakfast, the latter usually being gulped against time. Its menu is modest, almost meagre, and 
seldom includes more than the conventional coffee and the conventional pocket-size coffee-ring; but it is seasoned with sprightly 
conversation, as two-breakfast votaries are lavishly gregarious. The auxiliary meal is a thriving institution in the ready-to-wear trade 
during the lull between the busy season. Its devotees include salesmen, designers an models. Proprietors do not protest, because 
after a glance over the morning's mail, they themselves join the hungry host. The waiter serve on sight, being fully aware of their 
patron's second-breakfast preferences. Coffee-cup parking space on the counters of the soda fountains of the Seventh Avenue drug stores is 
at a premium." <br>

"Because her husband, Alexander S. McGillivray, who worked nights, assertively made her eat a second breakfast with him on arising, Mrs. 
Ella McGillivray went before Superior Judge Scheinman yesterday and won a divorce. She declared she would retire early, arisen and 
partake of her breakfast, and that her husband, who arose much later, would insist on her eating again." <br>

"The mid-morning 'second breakfast' has become an institution in the American business world. Even the boss does it now. Chicago bosses 
say they've given up resistance to the 10 a.m. exodus for coffee. In fact, now that most of them have taken up the habit, they think 
it's a good idea...Restaurateurs estimate 90 per cent of Chicago's office workers duck out for coffee in the morning that 30 
per cent probably have had an earlier breakfast and that most of them eat something with their coffee. The report a penchant for sweet 
rolls among the women, while hand and eggs is the most popular 'snack' among the males." <br>

"The first breakfast is sometimes just a sandwich. There may be sausage and cheese, but no sweets. The Mayerhofers like something for 
breakfast that is very unusual in Germany--toast. They also like soft-boiled eggs. The second breakfast is 'mostly a sandwich' served 
of course with coffee which goes with every meal." <br>

"Anyway, who--except possibly the English, with their pause for afternoon tea--would have guessed a few years ago that many 
Americans would be serving, or letting caterers serve, second breakfasts in their plants and offices these days? Personnel managers 
have even been known to mention this 'incentive' in their search for help. The Second World War, with the ten-minute 'break' 
for men not in the fighting lines, no doubt furthered the trend. And then, afterward, some business managements saw so much 'going 
down for coffee' that they reasoned that time and money could be saved by taking the stuff to the bench and desk. The rules and the 
arrangements vary, just as other 'fringe benefits do.' Some employers pick up the tab; some let caterers roll tray-laden wagons 
among employes to sell snacks. Some shops allow beverages only, mindful of the clock and maybe the mouse that ran up the clock." <br>

"Whenever a playwright becomes intensely harassed trying to measure exact amounts of religion, politics and sex into one character, the 
chances are good that tickets have been printed for a new play about that canonized habitude of Broadway, Joan of Arc. In this 
instance, the distressed writer, Lillian Hellman, was trying, between mouthfuls of a second breakfast in her hotel room...The 
last chunks of egg and bread vanished between strong jaws..." <brf>

"When you breakfast on the Eastern seacoast and arrive at the Pacific in time to cine, the myth is overwhelmingly plausible. Very 
soon the jet-liners will get you there in time for a second breakfast, and then the matter will seem beyond argument." <br>

"At 3 A.M. we were rudely awakened by a sepulchral voice at the tent door, 'Breakfast in five minutes!'...It was still too dark to really se what was on for breakfast. Someone said one pot contained porridge. On pouring some of the 
contents into our mug, we found it did indeed. We swallowed some coffee, located bacon in the frying pan and devoured bread and jam... 
By 8 o'clock we were ravenous and halted for a second breakfast." <br>

"There are many things that 'show folk' must do from which folk in other occupations are exempt. Most of them require strict 
discipline...When I get up at 5 a.m., I have breakfast. It consists of 8-ounces of orange juice, a large bowl of cereal with heavy 
cream, two eggs, six slices of bacon, several pieces of toast with jam naturally, a couple of cups of coffee with four lumps of 
sugar and a lot of cream. While I'm nibbling away at this I make at least a couple of sandwiches which I carry in what might be called 
a purse-lunchbox. When I arrive at the studio, I have a second breakfast of hot rolls, coffee, and anything else that isn't 
nailed down." <br>

"The Viennese...thrive on a second breakfast called a gabel fruhstuck. The key word is gabel, meaning 'fork.' Thus anything served 
at this second breakfast must be suitable for eating with a fork, such as a steaming portion of beef goulash." <br>

"The city government moved yesterday to expedite the civil service coffee break by bringing midmorning refreshments to offices 
rather than have employes slip out to get them or send time on the phone for calling for orders. Public Work Commissioner Eugene 
E. Hult began the new system yesterday morning when he started 14 shiny metal carts carrying coffee, milk, juices and cakes from 
Schrafft's on regular rounds among the 5,000 city employees in the Municipal Building...The employees will save...because the 
Schrafft's prices (15 cents for coffee, 15 cents for danish) average less than those charged by take-out services at 
neighboring coffee shops. The city will benefit...because Schrafft's will turn over 6 1/2 per cent of its sales, with a minimum of 
$500 a month, as a rental fee...Mr. Hult said that although thousands of manhours were lost through coffee breaks, his aim was to
improve, not eliminate it." <br>

<p>
"If both mother and father work outside the home, breakfast often consists of only a cup of coffee or a glass of milk, but when the 
individual members arrive at their destination, either office or factory or school, they complete their breakfast with a 
coffee break from the food cart or at the school or factory cafeteria. If that second breakfast supplies some citrus, either such as whole 
or reconstituted cereals, egg, cheese or meat and milk for children, nutritional requirements can be maintained." <br>

"While waiting for breakfast to arrive, I get up four times to answer knocks at the door...After waiting a half-hour I call to 
ask what the upper-class waiting time is for breakfast. 'It's an hour and fifteen minutes (be)fore afternoon tea.'...Breakfast 
arrives on a tray, and at the time there is sugar...Ten minutes later a second breakfast arrives on the trolley. I realize 
that the Hugheses of the world like two breakfasts, the second arriving 10 minutes after the first." <br>

<p>
<b>[1979] </b><br>
"Most people 'break the fast' with a morning meal using up one-fourth of their day's calories. That breakfast habit is right on target 
according to recent surveys. Nutrition experts agree that breakfast is the essential meal of the day for all age groups. People 
throughout the world enjoy a wide variety of food, but breakfasts usually contain protein, fruit or juice, cereal and often, milk... 
...In Germany the first fruhstuck (breakfast) might consist of crisp little roll; rye/dark breads, served with butter and jam; eggs-- 
generally soft-cooked rather than fried or scrambled. Then, between 9 a.m. and 10, they have a sweits fruehstueck (second 
breakfast). For children at school, this might consist of a sandwich, or plain bread, with a banana or apple." <br>
---"Once Around the Worldwide Breakfast Table," <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, February 1, 1979 (p. H30) 
<p>
<b>[2001] </b><br>
"Second breakfast is surely universal, although it is so much richer an idea than the American coffee break and perhaps even the British 
elevenses...Gabelfruhstuck is also more delightful way to say...The coffe break, squeezed in as it is among the demands of work and 
office chat, is all about caffeine intake, noteworthy more in a sociological than a gastronomical sense. Gabelfruhstuck (GAH-bel- 
froosh-took is a close approximation) is not so insubstantial. The term means literally 'fork breakfast' which suggests a meal eaten 
with utensils, not the fingers. And, traditionally, this was the case for workers in the central European countries who partook of a 
midmorning plateful of stew, sometimes called fruhstickgulasch, meaty and savory with paprika. Hearty fare, taken with or without a 
fork, is still the custom in that part of the world...For travelers...a second breakfast offers another opportunity...to eat, rest, 
observe and ruminate about the impressions and experiences of the morning...Perhaps taking time out for second breakfast is like visiting 
a museum to see a single painting. If it is a good painting, there is plenty to keep you occupied and satisfied for a while... 
Since I normally eat only the lightest of first breakfasts, coffee and the occasional slice of toast, by midmorning I'm ready to refuel." <br>
