<font color="#00366">Alcohol-free <a href="sodafountain.html#sodafountains">soda fountains</a> flourished during Prohibition. 
Emulating bartenders of days past, fountain mixologists were admired for their showmanship and endless 
supply of creative concoctions. Trendy <a href="foodicecream.html#sundaes">
ice cream sundaes</a>, like cocktails, paid tribute to popular people, places, music, politics and theatre. 
This makes sundaes a perfect medium for learning about 
the popular culture of this particular decade. The selections below were published in <i>The Dispenser's Formulary</i>
, [Soda Fountain Publications:New York] 1925. If you were a customer in a 1920s soda fountain you knew what the <a href="sodafountain.html#names">

We're dishing these sundaes with a side order of history. Enjoy!</font>

<b>Historic context weighs in:</b><br>
"'Well, what'll your's be?' queried the man in the white apron behind the counter of a Broadway soda fountain yesterday. 'Cream
soda,' was the laconic rejoinder of the young man with the ice cream clothes, the don't-give-a-hang air and the red-rimmed eyes.
'Flavor?' 'Don't care.' The young man gave it a peculiar intontaion, but it was lost on the soft-drink dispenser. He spilled a little
syrup on it, shot in a torrent of fizz-eater, stuck a coupe of straws atop and set the result of the operations before his customer. The
languid one sipped once, stared, sipped again and scowled. 'Say, what's this stuff, anyway?' 'Just what you ordered. Ic cream, 
soday water and 'don't care.' 'Sure, but-er-I thought 'don't care' was-ah-whisky, you know.' 'Not in this town, it ain't,' said the
man of spoons and syrups grimly. 'You can't get booze flavors by the 'don't care' route any more--not in Los Angeles. 'Don't care'
means a lot of things, according to the place you go to, but it don't mean whisky anywhere. Here it means sarsparilla. See?' 'No I don't
see. What's the matter with the world anyway? Is this part of the reform wave?' 'Not that I know of,' returned the fountain man, swashing his
glasses about inte tank. 'We cut out the old way a good while ago, along with everybody else around these parts. It made too much
trouble. Every once in a while somebody comes in and says 'don't care' when we ask him what flavor he wants. Maybe he means whisky and then,
again, maybe he don't. Maybe he's a good sport--but he's just about as likely to be a Sunday-school superintendent. I gave a kind of a seedy-looking
chap a good stiff shot of brandy one time when he said 'don't care,' but never again. He turned out to be a delegate to an Epworth 
League meeting and he just naturally raised thunder. Said he'd have me pinched for selling liquor without a license 
and so on...No sir, if you 'don't care,' there's a gin-mill right around the corner."<br>---"Don't Care, You know. Local Foam and Fizz

hardware store where the tinner will make one for about 75 cents. The size of the mold will depend upon the size of the car one 
wishes to represent. A colonial style 'happy-thought' dish is recomended for dispensing the sundae. The cream when molded
should measure 3 X 1 X 3/4 inches and have the shape of a car with a seating capacity of  eight. The mold is so made that it leaves
the inside of the car hollow. Into this cavity is poured a mixture of crushed pineapple and strawberry fruits and over it is 
sprinkled a few finely ground nuts. Then place small candy Teddy Bears around the car--three on either side and one at either end. Then
put two spoonfuls of whipped cream evenly along the center of the car and serve the sundae with three assorted wafers on a small

"Have an individual mold made by a tinsmith. He may use for a model a small ice cream sandwich mold, making it three inches
wide and two and one-half inches long. Have the bottom plate made to fit very closely and perfectly flat on the inside so as not to 
retain any soft cream or water that may accumulate during the rush hours. Take two saucers, one smaller than the other, put
a napkin between them, place a fresh, crisp lettuce leaf on the top saucer, then proceed with the sundae. Cut a slice of
orange, trim all the rind off carefully and put it on the bottom of the mold. Place a creme de menthe cherry in each corner and 
fill mold half full of vanilla ice cream. Then cover with two nabisco wafers, several slices of pineapple (creme de rose
pineapple adds to the color scheme), and fill balance of mold with orange sherbet or water ice. Press firmly, turn out and place
before your customer. Always be careful to thorougly drain your fruit before using and it works easier if chilled. Should the

<b>About the soda fountain trade, 1925</b><p>
"Soda sales in the United States have grown to the astonishing total of $497,500,000.00, and when we add to this the luncheonette
business of $176,650,000.00 and candy sales of $800,000,000.00 we reach a gross total for all three branches of the fountain
trade's sales of nearly a billion and a half dollars. Competition for this business is keen for there are 91,241 real soda
fountains in the country, giving an average daily sales of $46.10 per fountain. Over forty thousand fountains--nearly half
of the total--are in confectionery and soda shops; 38,503 are in the drug trade; over 7,000 in department, general and five and 
ten cent stores; the balance, 4561 are in other miscellanous places of business and amusement. All these fountains are
distributed throughout the entire country pretty much in proportion to the population, although they are higher than the average
in the various New England states and somewhat below the general ratio to population in the southern sections.
<p>
"These are interesting and significant figures, and it is a wise thing for a fountain man once in a while to sit down and
study his market so as to judge more wisely his opportunities. It is an encouraging feeling for the man of energy and 
ambition to learn that all of the fountains in the country there are a 'best third'--33,510 to be exact--which do nearly
three-quarters of the business and have an average daily sale of $91.40. It is a very tangible and attainable ambition to put your
fountain into the class of the elite fountains, and here is a practical and convenient yardstick for measuring your trade
accomplishments...Competition is keen in the fountain trade...there are three factors in the success of a fountain store--
quality, sanitation, and service...The public is sensitive in the matter of its beverages and is becoming more and more
discriminating in its tastes. The pure-food campaigns, the wide-spread propaganda for sanitation and hygiene, and the 
growing enlightenment of the people are all reflected in the demand at the soda fountain...the soda fountain which 
acquires and maintains a reputation for quality and purity automatically enjoys a profitable popularity."<br>

<b>What's in a name?</b><br>
While soda fountain menus typically offered fanciful product names, the industry promoted standardization. Then, as today, patrons
wanted to know what they were getting when they ordered a item. 
<p>
"Aside from the direct usefulness of this book to thousands of fountain owners...it has done a wider service to the entire
fountain trade in assisting to standardize fountain practice and promote uniformity in the naming of fountain drinks. Since the
standard definitions of the various classes of fountain drinks and delicacies was first published...it has been conclusively proved that
the rage for trick or fancy names was not a sound selling policy. The public wants to know just what it is going to get when it orders
a banana split or a frosted coffee. They will not gamble far with their own taste, and except in the case of the fancy
syndaes, a fancy name is poor merchandising. Even when, in this case, a catchy or timely name is used to push a specialty, it is 
money-making wisdom to indicate on menu or wall strup just what the principal ingredients and flavors are." (p. 11-12)
<p>
"Words of warning can advantegeously be sounded in the matter of naming sundaes. The names in the following pages are standard in 
many cases. A great number of the following formulas are prize winner in the Soda Fountain's monthly contests and as such,
have a wide reputation. There is always a danger in carrying the fancy name idea too far--for a fine name does not of
necessity mean a fine sundae, while the too fancy names are apt to be fantastic and even funny to one who possesses a
sense of humor. Stick to original names of the sundaes and help make them more and more standard and uniform. The Formulary
contains typical formulas for sundaes for every special occasion. A decidedly local event or intimiate personal touch is then
only reasonable excuse that can be advance for the use of a specially coined name." (p. 105)
