<font color="#003366" size="4">Buche de Noel</font><br>
Buche de Noel is one of many traditional cakes baked at Christmas. As the name suggests, it is of
French origin. The name of this recipe literally translates as "Christmas log," referring to the
traditional Yule log burned centuries past. The ingedients suggest the cake is most likely a 19th
century creation. That's when  thinly rolled <a href="foodcakes.html#sponge">sponge cakes</a>
filled with jam or cream and covered with <a href="foodcakes.html#icing">buttercream icing</a>
begin to show up in European cook books. <a href="foodcandy.html#marzipan">Marzipan</a>
and <a href="foodpies.html#lemon">meringue</a>, typically employed for decorative purposes,
date to the Medieval Ages and the 17th century  respectively. We find no person/place/company
credited for having *invented* this particular confection. 
<p>
"[In France] where the buche de Noel, a roll of light sponge cake, is covered in chocolate or
coffee buttercream textured to resemble bark. The conceit is carried further by mounding the
cream over small pieces of cake stuck to the main roll, to represent trimmed branches. The ends
of the roll and the cut faces of the  branches are finished with vanilla cream, imitating pale newly
cut wood, and the whole is decorated with leaves made from icing, or meringue
mushrooms."<br>

"Yule Log (Buche de Noel)</b><br>
The yule log cake is served at the midnight feast that follows Mass on Christmas Eve. Although it does not take the place of our 
flaming Christmas pudding, it makes a nice dessert to serve at any time during the Christmas season.<br>
4 egg yolks<br>
1/3 cup sugar<br>
1/2 cup sifted all-purpose flour<br>
2 tablespoons melted butter<br>
3 egg whites<br>
Chocolate Butter Cream 1 <br>
1 teaspoon instant coffee<br>
1 teaspoon hot water<br>
2 or 3 blanched almonds<br>
angelica<br>
candied cherries<br>
green sugar<p>
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.<p>
Rinse the mixing bowl with hot water and wrap a hot wet towel around the base. Combine the egg yolks and sugar and beat for
5 minutes or until the mixture has doubled in volume. Fold in the flour and then the butter, which should be cooled. Fold in the 
beaten egg whites gently but thoroughly.
<p>
Butter a small, rimmed baking sheet or roasting pan (10X14) and dust it with flour. Pour the batter into the pan and smooth it 
evenly with a knife. Bake 10 minutes. Spread a damp towel on a marble slab or table. Run a knife around the edge of the baked cake and
turn the pan upside down on the towel, leaving the pan on top of the cake until it is cool. Make the butter cream, using 5 egg yolks, 
and add to it the dissolved instant coffee. Spread the cake with the butter cream and roll it up lenghthwise like a jelly
roll. Place seam side down on a long serving tray and cut off both ends diagonally. Put the remaining butter cream in a pastry
bag fitted with a flat cannellated tip. Force the cream lengthwise over the surface of the cake to give the appearance of bark. 
Place a 'knot' here and there. Decorate the cake with almonds and a sprig of holly made with strips of angelica and little
rounds of candied cherries. Sprinkle very lightly with green sugar."<br>

<font color="#003366" size="4">Candy canes</font><p>
Why are some candies associated with Christmas? Hundreds of years ago <a
href="foodcandy.html#aboutsugar">sugar</a> was very
expensive. It was a food of the wealthy. For other people, it was a special treat saved for holidays
(Christmas, Easter) and other special occasions (weddings, christenings). Many of these traditions
remain today. About <a href="foodcandy.html#aboutcandy">candy<a/>.
<p>
Food historians tell us that hard candies (sticks, losenges, etc.) were originally manufactured for
medicinal purposes. This idea survives today in the form of cough drops. Confectioners were
quick to recognize the popularity of hard candy, in its various forms. Before long, hard candies of
all sorts of shapes, sizes, and flavors were produced for "recreational" purposes.
<p>
"The concept of sugar as medicine probably came from the tradition of Moslem physicians. They
came from a culture which knew and used sugar...That sugar was an expensive and exotic luxury,
used medicinally by the subtle and learned Arabs, probably helped reinforce medieval European
ideas of its intrinsic goodness. There were plenty of ailments in northern Europe for which sugar
was considered suitable treatment--coughs, colds, chest infections, agues. The Christ allowed
that sugar was medicinal (St. Thomas Aquinas himself apparently considered and pronounced on
the subject), which meant it could be legitimately nibbled during Lent, probably adding to its
appeal. It is no coincidence that our earliest information about pulled-sugar sweets in Britian,
using the very word penides that travelled all the way from the Orient, comes from compilations
of medicinal formulae, not elegant books on fine confectionery. A description of pulling sugar was
written down about 1500 in the York manuscript, under the title To make penydes...The art of
pulling sugar was evidently well understood 500 years ago..."<br>
---<i>Sugar-Plums and Sherbet: The Prehistory of Sweets</i>, Laura mason [Prospect
Books:Devon] 2004 (p. 84-5)
<p>
"When sugar first became known in Europe it was a rare and costly commodity, valued mainly for
its supposed medicinal qualities and finding its place in the pharmacopoeia of the medieval
apothecary...Sugar gradually became more widely available in Europe during the Middle Ages. In
Britain it was considered to be an excellent remedy for winter colds. It might be eaten in the form
of candy crystals...or it might be made into little twisted sticks which were called in Latin
 <i>penida</i>, later Anglicized to <i>pennets</i>. The tradition of penida survives most clearly
in American stick candy which is similarly twisted and flavoured with essences supposed to be
effective against colds, such as oil of wintergreen."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
210)

<p>
<B>WHAT ABOUT THE CANDY CANE?</b><br>
The origin of the candy cane is an interesting study of food lore and legend. It is easy to find
information on this topic in books and on the Internet. The most popular story is the one about
the German choirmaster who handed these out to his young singers in 1670 to keep them quite
during a long church service. There is also controversy as to the origin of the shape. Does it
represent a shepherd's crook? Or the letter "J" for Jesus? Bear in mind, most of these stories are
undocumented. <ul>

cane</a>, Christianity Today
<li><a href="http://www.snopes.com/holidays/christmas/cndycane.htm">Urban Legends: candy
canes</a>
</ul>
How to make candy canes? This is from a professional text:
<blockquote>
<b>"Candy canes for Christmas</b><br>
Run out a batch of any flavor stick candy, usually peppermint and lemon are the best sellers, spin
these sticks any size you wish and in cutting these cut off at angles. Now have your helper roll
them so as to keep them round an when they begin to get cold crook the angle, then set them to
one side to harden. Your helper's rolling them until they become cold keeps them from getting
flat on one side which affects the sale of them greatly. It is best when spinning these out to make
one end of the stick smaller than the other, then place the crook on the large end and have the
small end ofr the end of the cane. Candy canes can be made in any flavor or color, or any size
desired."<br>

<font color="#003366" size="4">Christmas cookies</font><p>
Cakes of all shapes and sizes (including smaller items such as cookies) have been part of
festive holiday rituals long before Christmas. Ancient cooks prepared sweet baked goods to mark
significant occasions. Many of these recipes and ingredients (cinnamon, <a href="foodfaq1.html#ginger">ginger</a>, black pepper,
almonds, dried fruits etc.) were introduced to Europe in the Middle Ages. They were highly prized
and quickly incorporated into European baked goods. Christmas
cookies, as we know them today, trace their roots to these
Medieval European recipes. Dutch and German settlers introduced cookie cutters, decorative molds, and festive holiday decorations to
America. Dutch <a href="newyear.html#newyearcookies">New Year's cookies</a> were also sometimes molded into fancy shapes. German lebkuchen (<a href="christmasfood.html#gingerbread">gingerbread</a>) was probably
the first cake/cookie traditionally associated with Christmas. <a href="foodcookies.html#sugarcookies">Sugar cookie</a> type recipes 
descended from English traditions. Did you know <a href="foodcookies.html#animal">Animal crackers</a>
began as edible ornaments? 
<p>
"By the 1500s, Christmas cookies had caught on all over Europe. German families baked up pans
of Lebkuchen and buttery Spritz cookies. Papparkakor (spicy ginger and black-pepper delights)
were favorites in Sweden; the Norwegians made krumkake (thin lemon and
cardamom-scented wafers). The earliest Christmas cookies in America came ashore with the
Dutch in the early 1600s."<br>
---"America's Best Holiday Cookies," <i>McCall's</i> [magazine], December 1994 (p. 85)
<p>
The flood of cheap imported wares form Germany between 1871 and 1906 when the import laws were changed, inundated our 
Christmas markets with cooking utensils like...cookie cutters...Unlike homemade counterparts, or local tinsmith's wares, these
tools depicted highly stylized images, often frawn from secular themes or...with subjects designed specifically to hang on the
Christmas tree. Likewise, recipes appeared in popular cookbooks to better match the demands of such utensils...In a sense,
with the advent of inexpensive tin cutters, new emphasis was placed on shape, where in the past, many homemade cookies simply had
been square or round. Bells, Christmas trees, camels, crimped wares (cutters with zigzag edges), lilies, Sant Clauses, turkeys, all of 
these elaborate shapes tended to deemphasize texture and flavor."<br>

<b>What about the Christmas cookie exchange?</b><br>
The Wellesley Cookie Exchange made this practice of swapping home made cookies among participants famous, 
but they didn't "invent" the idea. Our survey of historic USA newspapers confirms cookie exchanges (cookie swaps, cookie
trades, cooky exhanges) first surface during WWI. They were not necessarily connected with Christmas. Some early print 
references suggest they might have been fund raising bake sales rather than cookie-for-cookie exchanges. This is an excellent example of how some words & 
phrases mean different things in different times. Newspapers confirm cookie swaps, as we know them today, were recognized
as a "rising trend" in the early 1960s.

The Wellesley Cookie Exchange, arguably the most famous of American exchanges, began in 1971.
According to this article, it was inspired by an ariticle in a "women's" magazine:
<p>
"Snowflake Cheese Tarts. Butter Horns. Pecan Tartlets. Melting Moments. Lemon Snowballs.
These are some of the cookies that document the history of the Wellesley Cookie Exchange.
Each has been presented at least once in the 25 years the group has met to trade home-baked
holiday goodies. This year's exchange, scheduled to take place today, will once again bring an
assortment of sugar-dusted confections to Mary Bevilacqua's living room. This tradition, started
by Bevilacqua and her friend, Laurel Gabel (who has since moved away), has become a beloved
part of the holiday season for the 25 women who participate. Though many churches and informal
groups hold cookie exchanges each year, the Wellesley group is one of the few that has inspired a
cookbook. Susan Mahnke Peery of Yankee magazine collected 200 of their recipes and added her
own to "The Wellesley Cookie Exchange Cookbook" (Dodd, Mead & Co., 1986). Readers from
around the country still write to Bevilacqua about the book and one of the "Wellesley Cookie
Exchange" recipes was published in Family Circle in December 1995. Much of the group's
longevity comes from the old-fashioned fun of swapping holiday treats. But the cookie exchange
also anchors the holiday season for participants who like the continuity of this once-a-year event.
<p>
"We look forward to it," said Leah Rourke, who has been participating for almost 20 years.
"Today, people don't bother with things a lot. Everyone's in a hurry. It's nice to keep a tradition."
Bevilacqua helps set the festive tone by decorating her home with Christmas table runners,
placemats and china. She also serves a buffet lunch or dinner before the official exchanging
begins. Each member arrives with three dozen cookies to share and an empty container.
Bevilacqua calls the crowd to order by ringing a bell. Then each person passes her cookies around
for all to sample. By the end of the exchange, each participant has assembled a container full of
assorted cookies - and heard plenty of humorous stories. "Everyone gets a chance to tell about
her cookies. We hear who left out what, or how the name of the cookies was changed because
they were supposed to be fingers and they looked like blobs," said Bevilacqua. She always bakes
an extra batch in case someone has a disaster that prevents her from bringing cookies. Though
some people make the same cookies each year - traditional favorites such as gingerbread men or
candy-cane twists always turn up - others try a different recipe each year. "I'll be on the beach
reading recipes in the summer and start thinking about what to make for the exchange," said
Lynne Casale, who has been participating for 16 years. Laughing, she remembered the year her
husband and stepchildren ate up all the cookies she had baked for the group, leaving her
scrambling for a replacement. Though many women go all out and try recipes that would
challenge a professional pastry chef, the atmosphere is more friendly than competitive. Bevilacqua
said, "Brownies are fine. Not everybody makes fancy things."
<p>
Kathleen Miller, who has known Bevilacqua since both were in college, said, "You get a
wonderful assortment to take home. I always go home and sample one, and then another "
Starting a longstanding tradition was the furthest thing from Bevilacqua's mind when she and
Gabel began the exchange in 1971. "I had read a magazine article about a cookie exchange as a
way to de-stress the holidays," she said. As a mother of four young children, she thought it was a
good idea. Since the cookbook was published, Bevilacqua has compiled enough recipes for
another book. The cookie exchange tradition has also come full circle in her family. Her two
daughters participate each year, and one has started her own exchange."<br>

Food historians confirm the practice of giving/sharing food with loved ones on special occasions is as old as human-kind. Food means life. Giving food symbolizes the sharing of life.
Ancient cultures typically shared cakes, meat, sweets, bread, and wine during feast times. Some of these
foods also became symbolic in religious ceremonies.
Hard cheeses have long been valued and shared. In pre-industrial times, any food able to withstand the
tests of temperature and time was indeed precious. Softer cheeses did not stand this test, and were
therefore valued even more (especially when encrusted with expensive nuts) for their cost and care. 
<p>
Our survey of "cheese ball" recipes in USA cookbooks and newspapers returned a wide variety of recipes and 
applications. Much to our surprise, cheese ball can be deep fried, baked, or refrigerated. They can be served hot or cold.
 They can accompany salads, be served as appetizers or pop up as desserts. Festive holiday nut-encrusted cheese presentations
are also proffered commercially. If you are looking for 
specific recipes from particular cookbooks/chefs let <a href="mailto:foodtimeline@aol.com">us know</a>. Happy to help you track them down!

"...popular among nibblers who approach pure cheese gingerly are items adorned with nuts--ball-shaped, cylindrical, or shapes so 
ornate that they are difficult to distinguish from ckaes made by a patissier. There is, for instance, a long-established Lorraine 
cheese to which pistachios are added. But this should not be confused with the prevailing enthusiasm for decorating wheels of 
flavored processed cheese with walnut halves or stuccoing fist-sized spheres with crushed nut meats--merchandising measures that are 
still gathering momentum. It is interesting that Herkimer County in New York, once famous as the home of one of the New 
World's best Cheddars, is now better known for neatly packaged ball that is a melange of Blue Cheese, Cheddar, nuts, and 
whey. Perhaps even more eyebrow-raising are the 'chocolate cheese creams' made in Mayville, Wisconsin; they look like candies 
by have centers in which Wisconsin Edam is a principal ingredient. Black peppercorns provide an even more common means for 
embellishing cheese. Pepato is a traditional Roman variety produced in Sicily, southern Italy, and now in northern Michigan that has 
pepper arranged in layers and sometieme mixed into the curd." <br>

<font color="#003366" size="4">Christmas birds: peacocks, swans, geese & turkeys</font><br>
Food historians tell us the practice of serving large, stuffed fowl for Christmas, like many other Christian holiday food traditions, was
borrowed from earlier cultural practices. Peacocks, swans, geese and turkeys all fit this bill. The larger the bird, the
more festive the presence. "New World" <a href="foodmeats.html#christmasturkey">turkeys</a> were introduced to Europe
in the 16th century. For many years, these "exotic" turkey birds only graced the tables of the wealthy.
Working-class English Victorian families, like the Cratchits in
Charles Dickens' <i>Christmas Carol</i>, belonged to Goose Clubs. In America, turkey (wild and plentiful) was a natural choice for the Christmas
feast. Our survey of historic newspapers reveals the <a href="christmasfood.html#goose">goose</a> still commanded a traditional place on the Christmas table
 through the 19th century. Some traditions have serious staying power.
<p>
<a name="#peacock">
<b>Peacocks & swans</b><br>
"Apart from the wild and tame fowl for everyday consumption, there were a few which were outstanding as celebratory birds for 
feasts and festivals. These were swans and peacocks among the rich, and herons and bustards for those less well off. The pacock
made a fine show on a festive occassion...More usual than peacocks at feasts of the nobiltiy were swans. The Percy Family [Medieval
England] at them on the principal festivals of the church at the rate of five for Christmas Day, four for Twelfth Night, three
for New Year's Day...The family consumed an enormous range of both moor and waterfowl during the year, but the swans were appointed
for those special days. Swan was roasted like goose, and served with chawdron sauce...Those who were not in the swan-eating
class had goose or chicken."<br>

"The goose which the Celts had kept for pleasure were probably of the grey leg variety which has
remained the principal domestic goose of Britian." (p. 114)..."Goose was in season twice in its life, a young goose in early summer, and the 
fattened bird at Michaelmas. (p. 121) <br>

"The Christmas bird provided by the familiar "goose club" may be compared with the German
Martinmas goose. The more luxurious turkey must be relatively an innovation, for that bird seems
not to have been introduced into England until the sixteenth century."<br>

[Dover Publications:New York] 1976 (p. 284)

<p>
"The Martinmas or Michaelmas roast goose is actually the perpetuation of the ceremonies of
Celtic Samhain or Hallowe'en and Germanic Yule, originally the first day of the New Year, now
our 1st November. Van Gennep, writing on French folklore, reminds us that it was a good
occasion for feasting on tender geese that had must been fattened. Originally roast goose was a
thank-offering for the harvest that had been gathered in, the Erntedankfest or harvest home, a
sacrifice first to the spirit of vegetation, the to the gods of Odin and Thor. The goose, ritually
eaten, magically ensured the regeneration in the months to come of nature as she went
underground for the winter, precisely parallel to the Greek myth of the abduction of Persephone
by the lord of the underworld...The great feasts of Samhain-All Saints' and St. Martin's Day on
11th November were thus rituals uniting the assembled company of the living with the spirits of
the dead...During the Renaissance the tradition of eating goose on All Saints' Day was still widely
observed..."<br>
---<i>History of Food</i>, Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat, translated by Anthea Bell [Barnes and
Noble Books: New York] 1992 (p. 352-3)
<p>
"Feasting on geese has long been a tradition in the Old World, as is clear from ancient mythology.
The prevalence of goose gods in numerous cultures attests to the ritual importance of geese and
to the fact that these rituals date back to antiquity...The goose feast that came to characterize
holiday celebrations in later times arise as a modern-day derivative of these ancient rites and
sacrifices. People in Europe, Central Asia, North America, and North Africa customarily sacrified
geese, particularly at the turn of the seasons. Like other migratory fowl, geese appeared and
diappeared at crucial times in the yearly cycle, so eating them customairly accompanied
ceremonial events in the solar and agricultural year. People have linked geese to the changing
seasons for so long that originally the goose served as a sacrifice to the spirit of vegetation, in
thanks for the harvest. After the goose was ceremonially killed, participants in the sacrifice feasted
on its flesh in a ritual that they believed would ensure the regeneration of the Earth...Goose was
served at the Celtic Samhain, or Halloween; the Germanic Yule, originally the first day of the new
year; and Michaelmas, the ritual feast of the winter solstice. The Michaelmas feast is probably the
most famous goose feast, apart from that at Christmas dinner...Turkeys, native to the New World,
were more plentiful than geese during the period of early settlement. American settlers served
turkey at Thanksgiving, making it the seasonal feast bird. In much of the Western world today,
turkeys have replaced geese also at the Christmas feast; but for all practical purposes, these two
birds share the same symbolism. Just as the people of the Old World connected geese to the sun,
some of the North American tribes connected turkeys to the sun."<br>

[ABC-CLIO:Santa Barbara CA] 2000 (p. 105-6)
<p>
"Martinmas had once all the customary accompaniments of Christmas, ..but gradually, from the
time of the Roman occupation of Europe and its later solistial New Year, the majority of those
celebrations were moved forward to the later December date. All Souls' Day and Hallowe'en--a
time of falling leaves and fire festivals to help the sun's struggle with darkness--have in most
countries similarly moved forward much of their old ritual to the Christmas period...In Germany
and elsewhere the goose was the recognized Martinmas dish. And in England, as a large and
succulent bird, it took its place for a long time as the most popular Christmas dish...The turkey
was a gift from the New World. Spanish ships first brought it back from the Aztecs of Mexico to
Spain: thence it would have arrived in the Spanish Netherlands and finally it came to prosper in
England's Holland of East Anglia where the great turkey farms were started. It arrived in Spain in
1519; and it is said to have been eaten in England in the third decade of that century, though
possibly the bird was then confused with the guinea-fowl. When the guinea-fowl, well known to
the ancient Romans and Greeks, was rediscovered by the Portuguese in Africa at the beginning
of the sixteenth century, it came to England dubbed as the  Turkie-Henne'."<br>

South. In England posset was a hot drink in which the white and yolk of eggs were whipped with ale, cider, or wine. 
Americans adapted English recipes to produce a variety of milk-based drinks that combined rum, brandy, or whiskey with 
cream. The first written reference to eggnog was an account of a February 1796 breakfast at the City Tavern in 
Philadelphia. Beginning in 1839 American cookbooks included recipes for cold eggnogs of cream, sugar, and eggs combined

<b>What is Posset?</b><br>
"Possets were all the rage in the later Middle Ages, and survived unto the nineteenth century, but are no longer heard of. They were a warming concoction of hot milk mixed with hot beer, 
sherry, etc., sugar, and various spices, excellent for keeping the cold at bay in the days before central heating, and no doubt effective as a nightcap too..The source of the word is 
is not known, although some have suggested a link with Latin posca, a term for a drink made from vinegar and water."<br>

"Posset in its earliest medieval form was a drink made from milk lightly curdled by adding an acid liquid such as wine, ale, citrus juice to it. It was sweetened and often 
spiced. Sometimes curds and whey were separated and the curds mixed with conventional junket curds, breadcrumbs, and honey to make an 'eating posset' that was thick 
enough to slice. In the 17th century sack (like sweet sherry), claret, or orange juice were used in the eating possets. There were rich versions containing cream and eggs. Later 
additions the 18th century included almonds and crumbled Naples biscuits...Sack posset, long the most popular type..." <br>

Syllabub belongs to the English family of creamy dessert beverages combining dairy products and sweet wine. Think:
<a href="christmasfood.html#eggnog">egg nog, caudle & posset</a>. Originally a holiday
beverage, syllabub invited many interesting variations based on viscosity and application. <a href="christmasfood.html#dessertsyllabub">
Dessert syllabubs</a>, akin to trifle, flourished in the early 20th century.
<p>
<b>What was Syllabub?</b><br>
"The syllabub is a Tudor invention. Its defining characteristic is the mixing of white wine (or cider or fruit juice) with sweetened
cream, so curdling the cream, but from earliest times it has diverged into two basic types: a stiff version eaten as a dessert, and a
thinner one for drinking. The former was made with thicker cream, often reinforced by beaten egg whites, the latter with single cream
or even milk, sometimes introduced directly from the cow's udder into a bowl containing the wine and other ingredients. Both
sorts remained very popular until the mid-nineteenth century...but then they went out of fashion; the late twentieth century
has seen a revival of the firmer sort, as a sort of historical curiosity, but not of the drink. As for the name syllabub, that remains
a complete mystery. Early spellings include solybubbe, sullabub, selybube, and even sillibouk, and probably it was originally
just a fanciful meaningless coinage. Syllbub became the main form around 1700, probably due to the influence of the word
syllable."<br>

"Syllabub.--Traditional recipes cll for agitating sweetened cream and milk, well laced with white wine or cherry (or ale or cider), until
a great froth is obtained. The agitating is accomplished by methods varying from milking directly from the cow into a bowl of rich cream and wine to the use of a 
charming 'syllabub churn,' and ingenious device that produces a fine long-lasting froth. In addition to its other virtues, wine serves to 
lightly curdle the milk and 'set' the fluffy mixture. This fortifying dessert drink was known by Tudor times and became enormously popular
in colonial America. As ice cream became more available, the cool creamy syllabub came to be considered increasingly old-fashioned, although it did
linger in the South...Mrs. Randolph's recipe is not at all traditional and is quite quite beside the point."<br>

<p>
<b>Syllabub from the economic perspective:</b><br>
"The eighteenth-century fascination with creamy drinks can perhaps ony be explained by reference to the
ingredients themselves. They are not rare or exotic, but are often either colonial or betray some important
British trade connection. In other words, they seem to embody the growing power of the British Empire,
especially now that ordinanary housewives can purchase sugar from the West Indies, nutmeg from the Spice
Islands, lemons and sherry from Spain. The British housewife is apparently no longer aware that these were
once rare and costly ingredients available only to the wealthiest consumers. This syllabub recipe, one of
dozens, is something like a cross between an eggnog and a creamy dessert floating on wine."<br>

While the practice of making cakes with dried fruits, honey and nuts may be traced back to
ancient times, food historians generally agree that fruitcake (as we know it today) began in 
the Middle ages. In those days, imported, dried fruits and nuts were very expensive and generally saved for holiday fare.
Variations take their name cues from product color: white, golden & <a href="christmasfood.html#blackcake">black</a>.
<a href="foodcakes.html#japanesefruitcake">Japanese Fruit Cake</a>, a favorite of the Southern regional USA, incorporates
 "exotic" ingredients: coconut and pineapple. <a href="christmasfood.html#bishopscake">Bishops bread</a> (aka Stained Glass  or Jewel Cake) are
quick breads surfacing in the early 20th century.
<p>
What sets fruit cakes apart from their confectionery cousins is being prepared long before they are meant
to be enjoyed. Historically, alcohol provided both flavor and natural preservative. Today, that ingredient is no longer
necessary and often omitted.<p>
If you are looking for a particular fruit cake recipe (from a specific book, magazine, place or period) let us know.

"Fruit cake...a British specialty...The fruit cake as known today cannot date back much beyond
the Middle Ages. It was only in the 13th century that dried fruits began to arrive in Britain, from
Portugal and the east Mediterranean. Lightly fruited breads were probably more common than
anything resembling the modern fruit cake during the Middle Ages. Early versions of the rich fruit
cake, such as Scottish  Black Bun dating from the Middle Ages, were luxuries for special
occasions. Fruit cakes have been used for celebrations since at least the early 18th century when
 bride cakes and  plumb cakes, descended from enriched bread recipes, became cookery
standards. The relationship between fruit breads and fruit cakes is obvious in early recipes, such as
those given by Eliza Smith [1753] which include yeast...<p>
     Making a rich fruit cake in the 18th century was a major undertaking. The ingredients had to
be carefully prepared. Fruit was washed, dried, and stoned [taking the pits out] if necessary;
sugar, cut from loaves, had to be pounded and sieved; butter washed in water and rinsed in
rosewater. Eggs were beaten for a long time, half an hour being commonly directed. Yeast, or
 barm from fermenting beer, had to be coaxed to life. Finally, the cook had to cope with the
temperamental wood-fired baking ovens of that time. No wonder these cakes acquired such
mystique..."<br>

<b>Caribbean Black Cake?</b><br>
Our Caribbean cookery sources offer several recipes for fruitcakes, but only one titled [Jamaican] Black Cake." The recipe's headnote states: 
<p>
"This is a spin on fruitcake...The name comes from the cake's dark color, due mostly to the burnt-sugar coloring found in Caribbean kitchens. The coloring can be 
made easily...or purchased at a West Indian grocery. Molasses can be substituted with no loss of flavor, although it will make the cake dark brown, not black. The
 cake usually is served 2 to 3 days after it has been baked....To make the burnt sugar coloring, caralmelize 1/4 cup granulated sugar in a heavy saucepan. Add
 1/4 cup boiling water and remove from the heat. Combine thoroughly. The coloring will keep for several weeks in the refrigerator." <br>

not documented in a scholarly fashion. One of the classic phrases regarding the
longevity of this particular food was coined in 1983 by Russell Baker: "Fruitcake is forever."

"Thirty-four years ago, I inherited the family fruitcake. Fruitcake is the only food durable enough
to become a family heirloom. It had been in my grandmother's possession since 1880, and she
passed it to a niece in 1933. Surprisingly, the niece, who had always seemed to detest me, left it to
me in her will....I would have renounced my inheritance except for the sentiment of the thing, for
the family fruitcake was the symbol of our family's roots. When my grandmother inherited it, it
was already 86 years old, having been baked by her great-grandfather in 1794 as a Christmas gift
for President George Washington. Washington, with his high-flown view of ethical standards for
Government workers, sent it back with thanks, explaining that he thought it unseemly for
Presidents to accept gifts weighing more than 80 pounds, even though they were only eight inches
in diameter...There is no doubt...about the fruitcake's great age. Sawing into it six Christmasses
ago, I came across a fragment of a 1794 newspaper with an account of the lynching of a

<b>Bishop's Bread</b><br>
Bishops Bread (Bischofsbrot) is a quick holiday fruit cake possibly descending from northern and central Europe. Bishops Bread, as we Americans know it today,
is all over the culinary map. We find several fuzzy, undocumented "old fashioned" recipes for Bishop's cake (aka Bishop's 
Bread) which are sometimes also referred to as <a href="christmasfood.html#jewelcake">"Broken Glass," "Stained Glass," or "Crown 
Jewel" cake</a>. The Bishop's version is basically a densely packed <a href="christmasfood.html#fruitcake">fruitcake</a> which, when thinly 
sliced, reveals many colors. Therein lies the "jewel" or "stained glass" connection. The chocolate ingredient was introduced in the 1950s and proliferated in the
1960s.
<p> 
<b>What is "Bishop's bread?"</b><br>
"A few weeks ago, Georgetown reader 
requested the recipe for bishop's cake (or bishop's bread), which is basically a fruitcake with 
candied pineapple and cherries, but no citron or lemon peel. That's how we ended up in 
Slovakia/British Columbia. Melissa Bowen, a research librarian at Johnson & Wales University, 
found a bishop's cake recipe at the Web site of the Slovak Heritage and Cultural Society of 
British Columbia. We 
published that recipe Nov. 14. Since then, Melissa has found a reference to the cake in a book 
called "Patisserie" by Aaron Maree. It mentions something called "tiffany cake" that also goes by 
the names "American fruitcake, stained-glass Christmas cake and bishop's cake." The book 
states: "This cake contains so much crystallized fruit and is so rich that it is only served in thin 
slices. If held to the light, a slice should look like a stained glass picture."...Evelyn Ford of Edisto Beach 
shared this story with a movie-star angle: "In reading the recipes for bishop's cake, I was 
reminded of a recipe a friend gave me about 45 years ago ... for bishop's bread." <br>

If your grandmother ever entertained a circuit-riding preacher, she probably celebrated his presence at breakfast with Bishop's Bread, which in those
days required twelve hours, or more, to prepare. Made of potato sponge, it was set to rise in an earthen crock, jealously guarded from drafts with a homespun
blanket and baked in a brick oven. Now you can make this same bread half an hour before breakfast by following this modernized recipe from Ohio. And from
Ohio, by the way, comes Crisco--the sweetest flavored shortening I have ever used.
2 1/2 cups bread flour<br>
2 cups brown sugar<br>

briskly until batter is smooth. Pour into two Criscoed cake pans and scatter crumbs of original mixture over top. Bake for about 25 minutes in hot oven
(400 degrees F. If you want a richer bread, add chopped nuts and raiisn to the batter, and sprinkle extra cinnamon on top before baking. The Crisco will keep it

<b>BISKUPSKYU CHLEBICEK</b><br> 
"If you know how Bishop's Cake gets it name, bless you. I've been unable to find out for sure 
either the origin of the name or a definitive description of what's in the cake. A Georgetown 
reader recently requested help locating a Bishop's Cake recipe she remembered seeing in this 
newspaper in the early 1970s. She described it as a fruitcake with candied pineapple, candied 
cherries and lots of pecans, but no citron or lemon peel. It was flavored with a touch of bourbon. 
I consulted several books to try to learn more about the cake, but I didn't find any mentions of it 
at all. So I turned to the pros at the Charleston campus of the culinary university Johnson & 
Wales. Melissa Bowen, a research librarian, did some digging in the school's vast resources and 
found that there is a traditional Slovakian Christmas cake - a loaf cake - called Bishop's Bread. It 
has fruit, nuts and - surprise - sometimes chocolate. That wasn't one of the ingredients our 
Georgetown reader remembered. Melissa found a recipe for the bread/cake at a Web site 
operated by the Slovak Heritage and Cultural Society of British Columbia. "No Christmas is 
complete without Bishop's Bread on the table," it says. She also found another Web site that 
mentions a story about the bread getting its name because it was a special-occasion treat to serve 
to one's bishop on his occasional visits. That ties in with another story she found that mentioned 
some date bars that were "chewy and rich, flavored much like the Bishop's Bread served to 
circuit-riding preachers in the days of early America." Those stories shed a little light on the 
name, but there still seems to be some confusion about whether the bread/cake contains 
chocolate. In the spirit of giving equal time...I've included both versions here, and the traditional Slovakian recipe as well. First, 
here's the recipe for Biskupsky Chlebicek from the Slovak Society Web site. I had heard of "Icing 
sugar," which is what the British call powdered sugar - but I hadn't heard the expression "beat up 
a snow." Thanks to my British-born colleague Matt Owen for verifying the logical guess - that it 
means beating the egg whites into peaks.
<p> 
<b>Biskupsky Chlebicek </b><br> 
(Bishop's Bread) <br> 
(Makes 1 loaf) <br> 
pound butter <br> 
cup icing sugar (powdered sugar) <br> 
4 eggs, separated <br> 
cup all-purpose flour <br> 
2 ounces chocolate chips <br> 
2 ounces almonds <br> 
2 ounces chopped figs <br> 
1 ounce raisins <br> 
2 ounces candied chopped fruit <br> 
1 tablespoon baking powder <br> 
Mix butter, half of the sugar and the egg yolks. "Beat up a snow" (make a meringue) from the egg 
whites. Add the other half of the powdered sugar, and finish the snow (meringue). Combine 
flour, chips, nuts, fruit and baking powder. Fold together the egg yolk mixture, half the dry 
ingredients and half the snow (meringue). Finish adding the rest of the dry ingredients together 
with the other half of the snow. Bake in a buttered and floured loaf pan in a 350-degree oven for 
45 minutes to 1 hour. Bread is done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. 
Cool completely before slicing. Cake can be sprinkled with powdered sugar before serving. 
<p> 
Two readers - retired U.S. Navy Cmdr. Harry Huggins of Charleston and Linda Williamson of 
North Charleston - shared similar versions of the next recipe, and it certainly fits the description 
our Georgetown reader gave. Cmdr. Huggins' undated clipping of the recipe, from this 
newspaper, attributed the recipe to Kathy Daniel of Mount Pleasant. Linda's recipe 
included some interesting instructions for adding the alcohol flavor to the cake. Simply store the 
cake in a tin with a shot glass of bourbon or rum in the center hole of the cake. Over the course of 
a few weeks, the alcohol evaporates, and the cake absorbs the flavor. 
<p> 
<b>Bishop's Cake </b><br> 
cup all-purpose flour <br> 
pound each: red and green cherries and pineapple (crystallized) <br> 
4 cups pecan pieces <br> 
1 cup granulated sugar <br> 
pound butter <br> 
6 eggs <br> 
2 teaspoons lemon extract <br> 
teaspoon baking powder <br> 
Mix flour well with cut-up fruit and chopped nuts. Set aside. 
Cream sugar and butter. Beat in eggs one at a time. Add lemon extract. 
Combine fruit-nut mixture with egg mixture in buttered tube pan (or spray 
pan with nonstick spray). Fold in baking powder. Bake 30 minutes at 300 
degrees, then bake 2 hours more at 250 degrees. 
This cake can be made 3 to 4 weeks before Christmas and put in a covered 
cake tin with a shot glass of bourbon or rum in the center hole of the 
cake. The alcohol will evaporate during this time and flavor your cake. It 
also does not hurt if you pour about an ounce over the cake itself. Will 
keep well for several weeks in a cool spot. Jeani Jessen of Ladson sent a 
recipe that her mother found in a ladies magazine at Christmastime in 
1939. "Our family has made it yearly ever since. It's wonderful for folks 
who don't like fruitcake - but love chocolate! Our friends start 
requesting it about Thanksgiving." Jeani says the recipe originally called 
for chopped chocolate rather than chips. That got me wondering when 
chocolate chips were first sold. It turns out that the Nestle Co. first 
produced them in 1939 - the very year Jeani's mother found the recipe in 
the magazine.

<p> 
Is there is a connection between the early American alcoholic beverage "Bishop" and this cake? Both call for 
oranges and sugar. May be worth investigating. Sample recipe from Eliza Leslie's <i>Directions for Cookery</i> [c. 1840] here: <br> 
"BISHOP. --The day before you want to use the liquor roast four large oranges till they are of a pale brown. You may do them either before a clear fire or in the oven of a stove. Dissolve half a pound of loaf-sugar in half a pint of claret. When the oranges are roasted, quarter them without peeling, lay them in the bottom of a bowl or a tureen, add two beaten nutmegs and some cinnamon, and pour on them the wine and sugar. Cover it, and let it stand till next day. Then having heated the remainder of the bottle of claret till it nearly boils, pour it into a pitcher, and having first pressed and mashed the pieces of orange with a spoon to bring out 
the juice, put them with the sugar, &c. into a cloth, and strain the liquid into the hot claret. Serve it warm in large glasses." <br>

<font color="#003366" size="4">Gingerbread</font><br>
Food historians confirm <a href="foodfaq1.html#ginger">ginger</a> has been flavoring foods and beverages from ancient times
forward. Gingerbread, as we know it today, descends from Medieval European culinary trditions. <a href="christmasfood.html#gingercookies">Ginger cookies</a>
feature prominently on Northern European Christmas tables.
<p>
<b>Why do we call it gingerbread?</b><br>
"The cakelike consistency of gingerbread bears little resemblance to bread, so it comes as no surprise that gingerbread has no
etymological connection with bread. It was originally, in the thirteenth century, gingerbras, a word borrowed from Old French
which meant 'preserved ginger'. But by the mid-fourteenth century,...-bread had begun to replace -bras, and it was only a matter of
time before sense followed form. One of the earliest known recipes for it, in the early fifteenth-century cookery book <i>Good
Cookery</i>, directs that it be made with breadcrumbs boiled in honey with ginger and other spices. This is the lineal ancestor
of the modern cakelike gingerbread in which treacle has replaced honey."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 142)
<p>
<B>About gingerbread in America</b><br>
"...most early American cookies were referred to as "cakes," and gingerbread was assumed to be a form of cookie, as in Lebkuchen,
a gingerbread cookie made with honey...Of all the Christmas pastries, the gingerbread cookie was one the one most loved by
early American children. I suspect that a large part of this popularity hinged on the fact that gingerbread was cheap, easy to
make, a small batch would yield many cookies, and that gingerbread dough stood up fairly well under the vagaries of both
brick-oven and cook-stove baking. It was pretty hard to ruin it...In American cookery, there are two distinct families of gingerbread
cookies, the honey-based gingerbreads of Middle European origin--mostly Germany--and the molasses shortbreads that developed
in England or Scotland, depending upon which historan you wish to believe. The other developed in the late seventeenth century,
using molasses as a substitute for honey...The Germans in this coutnry were the best honey cake bakers--they called the cookies 
Lebkuchen."<br>

<p>
<b>About gingerbread shapes</b><br>
"Gingerbread was ...ornamented by impressing designs within wooden moulds. The moulds were sometimes very large and 
elaborate and beautifully carved. In England, such confections were bought at fairs and, together with other sweet treats, were
known under the collective name of 'fairings'. The habit of shaping gingerbread figures of men and pigs, especially for Bonfire
Night (5 November) survives in Britain."<br>

<p>
<B>Gingerbread houses</b><br>
According to the some researchers, the first gingerbread houses may have
appeared as a result of the popular Grimm's fairy tales. Other food historians
postulate that the brothers Grimm were writing about something that already
existed. We cannot confirm either claim. Summary here:
<p>

"The tradition of baking the sweetly decorated houses began in Germany after the Brothers
Grimm published their collection of German fairy tales in the early 1800s.  Among the tales was
the story of Hansel and Gretel, children left to starve in the forest, who came upon a house made
of bread and sugar decorations. The hungry children feasted on its sweet shingles. After the fairy
tale was published, German bakers began baking houses of lebkuchen --spicy cakes often
containing ginger -- and employed artists and craftsmen to decorate them. The houses became
particularly popular during Christmas, a tradition that crossed the ocean with German immigrants.
Pennsylvania, where many settled, remains a stronghold for the tradition. It is believed
gingerbread was first baked in Europe at the end of the 11th century, when returning crusaders
brought the bread and the spicy root back from the Middle East. Ginger wasn't merely flavorful, it
had properties that helped preserve the bread. Not long after it arrived, bakers began to cut the
bread into shapes and decorate them with sugar. Gingerbread baking became recognized as a
profession. In the 17th century, only professional gingerbread bakers were allowed to bake the
spicy treat in Germany and France. Rules relaxed during Christmas and Easter, when anyone was
permitted to bake it. Nuremberg, Germany, became known as the "Gingerbread Capital of the
World" in the 1600s when the guild employed master bakers and artisans to create intricate works
of art from gingerbread, sometimes using gold leaf to decorate the houses."<br>

<b>"Lafayette Gingerbread</b><br>
Cut up in a deep pan half a ound of the best fresh butter, with a half pound of excellent brown sugar; and stir it to a cream with a spaddle. 
Add a point of West India molasses, mixed with half a pint of warm milk; four table-spponfuls of ginger; a heaped table-spoonful of mixed 
powdered cinnamon and powdered mace and nutmeg; and a glass of brandy. Sift in a pound and a half of fine flour. Beat six eggs till very light and thick,
and mix them, alternately, into the pan of butter, sugar, molasses &c. At the last, mix in the yellow rind (grated fine) of two large
oranges and the juice. Stir the whole very hard. Melt in one cup a very small level tea-spoonful of soda, and in another a small
level salt-spoon of tartaric acid. Dissolve them both in lukewarm water, and see that both are quite melted. First stir the soda into the
mixture, and then put in th tartaric acid. On no account exceed the quantity of the two alkalis, as if too much is used, they
will destroy entirely the flavoring, and communicate a very disagreeable taste instead. Few cakes are the better for any of the
alkaline powders, and many sorts are entirely spoiled by them. Even in gingerbread they should be used very sparingly, rather less than more of the
prescribed quantity. Having buttered, (with the same butter) a large round or oblong pan, put in the mixture, and bake it in a moderate
oven till thoroughly done, keeping up a steady heat, but watching that it does not burn. There is no gingerbread superior to this, if well 
made. Instead of lemon or orange, cut in half a pound of seedless raisins, dredge them well with flour, and stir them, 
gradually, into the mixture. This is also called Franklin gingerbread."<br>

"Ginger biscuits, including 'ginger snaps' and gingernuts, are the British representatives of a much wider group of 
European spiced biscuits, and are closely related to, indeed sometimes overlap with, gingerbread. Most recipes 
rely on the old method of melting treacle, golden syrup and brown sugar with quantities of butter, before adding 
flour. Originally the biscuits would have been based on melted honey...The German name for a biscuit of the 
same general nature is Pfeffernusse; while in Scandinavia, ginger or similarly spiced biscuits, often cut into heart 
or star shapes and decorated with icing, have names lie pepparkaka or peppernott....Although a literal translation 
in 'pepper cake', the names do not refer directly to pepper, but rather to the 'Pfefferlander', the eastern countries 
from which spices came. The selection of spices used in continental Europe is much wider than in Britain, and 
includes cinnamon, cloves, aniseed, nutmeg, and, in Scandinavia, cardamom, as well as ginger." <br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 338) <br>
[NOTE: Some early recipes call for white pepper as an ingredient. It is quite possible there is a connection between this ingredient and traditional
European recipe names.]
<p>
"Ginber nut. In the eighteenth century, sweet ginger-flavored biscutis were known as gingerbread nuts...Around the middle of the nineteenth century...gingerbread nut was
superseded by ginger nut. The element nut presumably refers to the biscuits' smallness and roundness...It also appears in spice nut, a now obsolete synonym for ginger net...

<p>
"In Sweden, Christmas starts on December 13, Luciadagen, of Saint Lucia's Day, 
with a charming ceremony that originated in an ancient legend of hospitality and 
goodness. Everyone rich and poor in ever corner of the country, a daughter of the 
household...rises before dawn and dresses in a white robe with crimson girdle, red 
stockings, and a crown of green leaves in which nine lighted white candles are 
placed. The girl, who impersonated Saint Lucia, announces the opening of 
Yuletide by visiting the bedside of each member of the family with a tray of 
coffee, buns and cakes...Often the Lucia group is accompanied by baker boys who 
have trays of Pepparkakor, or ginger cookies, and the traditional Lussekatter, or 
Lucia Cats. These are rich sweet buns, shaped like the letter X, and flavored with 
cardamom. They bear no resemblance to cats, save for their raisin eyes, but 
suggest, rather, some kind of ancient ceremonial bread. Their X-shape might be 
interpreted as the Greek letter chi which looks like X and stands for the name of 
Christ." <br>

<font size="4" color="#003366">Mincemeat and mince pies</font><br>
People have been mincing (chopping into tiny pieces) meat and other foods since ancient times.
<a href="foodmeats.html#mincedmeat">Hash</a> is  a  related food. Minced meats accomplished many things. It<ul>
<li>Utilized leftover meat 
<li>Stretched the protein supply 
<li>Permitted meat to be incorporated into other dishes, as in mincemeat pie.
</ul>
According to the food historians, mincemeat pie dates back to Medieval times. At that time, this
recipe did, indeed, include meat. It also often contained dried fruits, sugar, and spices, as was the
tradition of the day. The distinction between mincemeat and mince was drawn in the
mid-nineteenth century when meat began disappearing from the recipe, leaving the fruit, nut,
sugar,
spice, and suet product we know today. Late 19th century cookbooks contain several recipes for
both mincemeat and mince, some containing meat, others not. Some notes on the <a
href="foodpies.html">history of pie</a>. As one might expect, there are several variations on this culinary theme.
<a href="christmasfood.html#standpie">Yorkshire Stand Pie</a> and <a href="foodpies.html#capebreton">Cape Breton Pork Pies</a> are two prime
examples.
<p>
This is what the food historians have to say:
<p>
"Mincemeat. The modern distinction between mince,  minced meat and mincemeat,  dried fruit
mixed with spices, suet, and often some sort of alcohol arose only gradually. Mincemeat
originally meant simply  minced meat...and we do not have any unequivocable evidence of its
being used in its current sense until the mid-nineteenth century. But in the Middle Ages and into
Renaissance times and beyond it was commonplace to spice up or eke out meat with dried fruit,
and it seems likely that the earliest mincepies contained a generous measure of such raisins,
currants, etc. The reduction in meat content was a slow but steady process (still not complete, of
course, for the inculsion of beef suet is a remnant of it). The growing need to draw a lexical
distinction between the plain minced meat and mincemeat was signalled around 1850 by the
introduction of the term mince for the former."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 214)
<p>
"Mince pie in Britain, is a miniature round pie, filled with mincemeat: typically a mixture of dried
fruits, chopped nuts and apples, suet, spices, and lemon juice, vinegar, or brandy. Although the
filling is called mincemeat, it rarely contains meat nowadays. In North America the pie may be
larger, to serve several people. The large size is an innovation, for the original forms were almost
always small. The earliest type was a small medieval pastry called a chewette, which contained
chopped meat of liver, or fish on fast days, mixed with chopped hard-boiled egg and ginger. This
might be baked or fried. It became usual to enrich the filling with dried fruit and other sweet
ingredients. Already by the 16th century  minced or  shred pies, as they were then known, had
become a Christmas specialty, which they still are. The beef was sometimes partly or wholly
replaced by suet from the mid-17th century onwards, and meat had effectively disappeared from
 mincemeat' on both sides of the Atlantic in the 19th century."<br>

"Mincemeat. Also  Mince. A mixture of chopped fruits, spices, suet, and, sometimes meat that is
usually baked in a pie crust. The word comes from  mincem  to chop finely, whose own origins
are in the Latin minuere, "to diminish," and once  mincemeat referred specifically to a meat that
had been minced up, a meaning it has had since the sixteenth century. By the nineteenth century,
however, the word referred to a pie of fruit, spices, and suet, only occasionally containing any
meat at all. In Colonial America these pies were made in the fall and sometimes frozen throughout
winter."<br>

 then a thin Layer of Cittron cut very thin, then a Layer of Mince meat, and a thin Layer of Orange-peel cut think over that a little Meat; squeeze half the Juice of a

is cold, chop it very fine, and be very careful to get out every particle of bone and gristle. The sweeter and better to boil half an
hour or more in this. Pare, core, and chop the apples fine. If you use raisins, stone them. If you use currants, wash and dry them at
the fire. Two pounds of beef, after it is chopped; three quarters of a pound of suet; one pound and a quarter of sugar; three
pounds of apples; two pounds of currants, or raisins. Put in a gill of brandy; lemon-brandy is better, if you have any 
prepared. Make it quite moist with new cider. I should not think a quart would be too much; the more moist the better, if it does not spill
out into the oven. A very little pepper. If you use corn meat, or tongue, for pies, it should be well soaked, and boiled very tender. If you use
fresh beef, salt is necessary in the seasoning. One ounce of cinnamon, one ounce of cloves. Two nutmegs add to the 
pleasantness of the flavor; and a bit of sweet butter put upon the top of each pie, makes them rich; but these are not
necessary. Bake three quarters of an hour. If your apples are rather sweet, grate in a whole lemon."<br>

make the walls of thick standing crust, to any size you lie, and ornamented as fancy directs. Lay at the bottom of the pie a 
beef steak. Bone a turkey, goose, fowl, duck, partridge, and place one over the other, so that, when cut, the white and brown
meat may appear alternately. Put a large tongue by its side, and fill the vacancies with forcemeat balls and hard eggs, and
add savory jelly. This last is better for being kept in a mould, and only taken out as required. Bacon, chopped or beat up with
the forecemeat, is preferable to suet, as it is nicer when cold, and keeps better."<br>

"Yorkshire Pie.</b><br>
 A True Yorkshire pie, such as constitutes a standing dish during the Christmas
festivities at the hospitable board of a Yorkshire squire, is simply a raised pie filled with poultry
and game of different kinds, put one inside the other and side by side. These pies are sometimes
made of a large size; and it is recorded that one of them, which was sent from Sheffield in 1832
as a present to the then Lord Chancellor Brougham, broke down on account of its weight.
Yorkshire pies require both skill and patience for their manufacture. They are not common, and
are becoming less and less so; nevertheless, when successfully made they form a most excellent
dish, and one sure to be hightly appreciated. Turkey, pheasants, ducks, fowls, grouse, snipes, and
tongue; any or all of these may enter into their composition. Whatever birds are used should be
boned and partially stewed before being put into the pie: the smallest of them should be filled
with good, highly-seasoned veal forcemeat; a layer of forcemeat should be placed at the botton of
the pie, and all the vacant places filled with the same. A recipe here given for making a
moderate-sized pie. Bone a fowl and a goose; fill the fowl with good veal forcemeat, truss it, and
sew it up. Truss the goose, and put the two side by side in a stewpan which will just hold them.
Pour over them as much stock as will cover them, and let them simmer the fowl inside the goose,
truss the latter, and sew it up. Line a pie-mould with some pastry, such as is used for making
raised pies, rolled out to a good thickness. Cover the bottom with a layer of forcemeat, lay the
goose upon it, pour a little of the liquor in which it was stewed over it, and place round it slices
of pigeons, boned hare, tongue, &c. Fill the vacant places with forcemeat, and when the meat is
closely packed in the crust put over it a layer of clarified butter. Place the pastry-cover on the top,
brush over with egg, ornament it, bind several folds of buttered paper round it, and bake in a
well-heated oven. Make a little strong jelly by boiling the bones and trimming with seasoning
and spices, and pour this into the pie after it is baked. When the pie is to be served, place it on a
dish covered with a napkin, remove the cover whole, and cut the meat in thin slices. The pastry
of a pie like this is not made to be eaten but is simply intended as a case in which to preserve and
serve the meat. When a skewer will pierce easily to the bottom of the pie in the centre it is done
enough. Time to bake the pie, four hours or more."<br>

<a name="panettone">
<font size="4" color="#003366">Panettone</font><p>

Panettone is an Italian egg-enriched bread traditionally presented at Christmas. This
recipe, like others employing raisins, far east spices, and candied peel, dates to the Middle Ages. Origination stories 
and culinary traditions add festive notes to this holiday bread.
Our survey of historic USA/UK sources confirm Panettone first surfaced in English print in the late 19th century. Americans 
quickly drew the "obvious" conclusion that this was the traditional Christmas bread of Italy. Italians appreciate the fine
distinction between culinary regions. General concensus affirms Milan as the epicenter of Panettone. Other regions offer variations based on local
taste. Modern commercial panettone was "invented" in the 1920s, thanks to <a href="christmasfood.html#angelomotta">Angelo Motta</a>.
<p>
"Panettone, or 'great big bread loaf,' is a large domed yeasted dough, with a density of aroma that belies its light but firm 
texture, with a golden yellow interior and a brown outer surface, the top sprinkled with candied sugar, and the inside studded with dried
fruit and candied peels. The mixture is rich with sugar, honey, butter, and eggs, perfumed with vanilla and sometimes 
liqueurs, and has a softness and lightness that makes it an ideal cake to have around at Christmas time. It keeps well, so in many
Milanese households a quarter of this festive bread would be hidden away until 3 February, the feast of San Biagio, a saint who intercedes for those
with earache and sore throats, when as a potent relic of the Christmas rites it would be eaten for breakfast to ward off winter
colds...This survival from ancient Christmas rites was once connected with family rituals around the ceppo, a tree trunk or log, decked with evergreen
fronds, upon which gifts for the household and family were placed, and which, after their distribution, was ceremoniously burnt
on the fire, libated with wine by each participant, and poked to send up glittering sparks to delight the children. The ashes were 
carefully preserved to protect crops from hailstorms...The industrial production of panettone orginated in Milan in the 1920s, when 
Angelo Motta and Giacchino Allemagna started producing them, and now they are made all over Italy. But before then, Artusi had annoyed some of his
readers by printing a version perfected by his cook Marietta Sabatini using bicarbonate of soda and cream of tartar (baking powder) instead of
fresh yeast, so one can deduce that the Milanese version was already known, loved, and passionately defended in the early years of the 20th
century."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Italian Food</i>, Gillian Riley [Oxford University Press:New York] 2007 (p. 357-358)<br>
[NOTE: <a href="christmasfood.html#artusipanettone">Artusi's recipe</a> is the only one we find using chemical leaveners instead of 
traditional yeast.]
<p>

"Bakers made many...ritual Christmas breads, pane di Natale, by enriching the bread of everyday with lard, oil, or butter, adding
eggs, and kneading in nuts, raisins, dried fruits, and clean sweet-tasting candied fruits. Scholars trace the ancestors of
pannetone to the end of the fourteenth century, when Florentines folded walnuts, pine nuts, dried figs, dates, and honey into Tuscan
bread dough, making pan co'santi. By the seventeenth century, the historian Vincenzo Tanara wrote that the citizens of Emilia-Romagna made pan di
Natale by rolling raisins, black pepper, and hone-candied pumpkin right into ordinary bread dough. These low, dense Christmas 
breads, bursting with nuts and fruits, were nothing like the delicate, high-domed panettone that has become the famous Christmas
bread of Milan. The more recent versions were invented in the 1920s, when Angelo Motta founded a company that used natural yeast
 and tall cyclindrical forms to turn out a rich, porous, high-sided panettone. Studded with raisins and bits of candied orange and
citron, the new panettone was such a popular success that Motta's friend, Gioacchino Allemagna opened a competing business the next
year, and in the decades that followed panettone grandually became the Christmas bread of Italy. Nowadays panettone weichs one, two, or three 
pounds, while reustic panettone was traditionally made in enormous six- to ten-pound rounds. It was once a real status symbol for
immigrants who came to Milan and felt that they had arrived when they could set a panettone on their Christmas table."<br>

[NOTE: Ms. Field offers a recipe for Panettone Piemontese and several additional Italian Christmas breads.]
<p>
"Panettone lends itself to fabulation. The simplest fable connected with it states that its bulbous top is meant to honor the domes of Lombardy 
churches. One might as well maintain that Lombardy churches were given domes in honor of panettone...A more complicated fable is put forward 
to explain its name. Panettone, it alleges, was originally called pan de Tonio, Tony's bread. The Tony in question was supposed to be a poor 
15th-century baker. A wealthy young man interested in marrying his daughter staked Tony at the Christmas season with enough money to buy
 the finest flour, the freshest eggs, and, as an added value, sultana raisins and candied citron peel; as a result, pan de Tonio sold like hot cakes, 
and has been doing so every since (Tony's backer, of course, married Tony's daughter). Unfortunately for the story, panettone is simply the word 
for bread plus an Italian suffix which denotes bigness (like torteloni from tortelli); it means simply 'big bread,' bigness in this case referring to 
quality rather than quantity--'enriched bread,' if you want. Indeed the old name for panettone was pan grande--big bread, using a word for 'big' 
with a definite connotation of quality. The Tony's bread story connects panettone with Christmas, and on this count is in step with tradition. 
Panettone is involved in a very old Christmas ceremony. At this season, the head of each family used to cut three large slices from one of these 
cakes, and each member of the family ate a bit of each to insure good luck. The Duke of Milan himself used to perform this rite, in the Sala dei 
Fabioli (Bean Hall) on the third floor of the Castello Sforzesco. Panettone is eaten all year round now, but it is still associated especially with 
Christmas..." <br>

walked, penniless, to Milan thirty miles away and became in half a century the Italian 'King of the Christmas Cake.' When he opened his own
bakery after World War I, the Italian pannetone (Christmas cake) was the dish of the rich. By first changing the recipe slightly, then
applying mass production methods to its baking, Signor Motta brough the panettone within everyone's means. He had factories all over Italy and in South
America. Childless and generous, Signor Motta, a millionaire, founded a 'Christmas night present' of 200,000 lire ($325) checks, which he

<font size="4" color="#003366">Panforte</font><br>

Food historians generally attribute the origins of panforte, one of several traditional Italian enriched holiday breads, to Siena [Tuscany region]. Most ingredients 
descend from Medieval traditions. The final product is somewhat similar to pannetone. The addition of cocoa and confectioners' (powedered) sugar suggests
 panforte is really a modernized variation on an old culinary theme. Presumably? Dating no earlier than the late 18th or early 19th century. Legends abound, 
notwithstanding. In cases like these, culinary lore generally trumps fact. No matter. The result is delicious! 
<p>
"Panforte is a specialty of the Italian city of Siena. It is a rich cake filled with nuts, candied peel, honey, cocoa and spcies. Its characteristic feature is that it is baked
 hard--hence its name: Italian pane, 'bread', forte, 'hard'."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 238) 
<p>
"Panforte is a flat, solid, heavily spiced cake, stiff with nuts and candied fruit, and although now associated with Sienna, it is unlikely that it was invented there. Ofiignally made with honey for
sweetening and breadcrumbs to bind the mixture, it is now made with sugar as well as perfumed with vanilla, alongside the traditional spices--cinnamon, coriander, nutmeg,
cloves, and some peppercorns, to which might be added cardamom and anise or fennel. The honey and sugar are melted, and the toasted and chopped nuts, almonds, hazelnuts, and
walnuts, and diced candied peel of citron and orange, lemon zest, and spices, are stirred in wtih a little butter or oil...The mixture is poured into a shallow tin lined with
wafers or rice paper and cooked slowly in a low oven...Spice cakes or bread were described by Costanzo Felici in the 1560s. There were a great many of them, with
a multitude of shapes and names, most heavily spiced and containing dried fruit, figs, and nuts, sweetened with hone or sapa, hense the name pan melato or panpepato."<br>

<p>
"It is curious that Siena has so little to offer of its own, apart from general Tscan dishes. On historical grounds, one would expect much more independence from the
city-state which was the last to yield to Florence, in 1557...'Siena meant nothing except the place from which one got, at Christmas time, a special kind of cake called 
panforte.' Panforte (which means strong bread) is a rich fruitcake, whose ingredeints are flour, butter, eggs, almonds, walnuts, candied fruits...and honey, their
contributions dominated by one or another of various natural fruit flavors, such as orange or lemon. It is a direct descendant of a medieval spiced sweetened bread, embodying
honey and bits of dried fruit and figs."<br>

fruit became available in Britain, first raisins, then prunes in the 16th century, they were added.
The name  'plum' refers to a prune; but it soon came to mean any dried fruit. In the 16th century
variants were made with white meat...and gradually the meat came to be omitted, to be replaced
by suet. The root vegetables disappeared, although even now Christmas pudding often still
includes a token carrot...By the 1670s, it was particularly associated with Christmas and called
  'Christmas pottage'. The old plum pottage continued to be made into the 18th century, and both
versions were still served as a filing first course rather than as a dessert...What currently counts as
the traditional Christmas pudding recipe has been more or less established since the 19th
century."<br>

<p>
"...the name Christmas pudding appears to be a comparatively recent coinage, first recorded in Anthony Trollope's Doctore Thorne (1858).
The association of dishes containing mixed dried fruit and spices...with Christmas is a longstanding one, though. Most of them
originally contained dried plums, or prunes, but long after these had been replaced by raisins the term plum lingrered on...
Nowadays served only at Christmas...this was formerly a common year-round pudding."<br>

"The plum pudding's association with Christmas takes us back to medieval England and the Roman Catholic Chruch's decree that the  
'pudding should be made on the twenty-fifth Sunday after Trinity, that it be prepared with thirteen ingredients to represent Christ
and the twelve apostles, and that that every family member stir it in turn from east to west to honor the Magi and their supposed
journey in that direction.'... Banned by the Puritans in the 1660s for its rich ingredients, the pudding and its customs
came back into popularity during the reign of George I. Known sometimes as the Pudding King, George I requested that plum pudding be
served as part of his royal feast when he celebrated his first Christmas in England after arriving from Hanover to take the throne
in 1714. By 1740, a recipe for 'plum porridge' appeared in <i>Christmas Entertainments</i>. In the Victorian era, Christmas annuals, 
magazines, and cookbooks celebrated the sanctity of family as much as the sanctity of Jesus' birth, and the tradition of all family
members stirring the pudding was often referenced...Poorer families made the riches version of
plum pudding that they could afford...Even workhouse inmates anticipated a plum pudding on Christmas Day."<br>

<b>What is the classic recipe?</b>
<br> There are as many recipes for Christmas pudding as there are cooks. These notes, circa
1875, sum it up best:<br>
<blockquote>
<b>Christmas Plum Pudding.</b>-- The plum pudding is a national dish, and is despised by
foreign nations because they never can make it fit to eat. In almost every family there is a recipe
for it, which has been handed down from mother to daughter through two or three generations,
and which never has been and never will be equalled, much less surpassed, by any other...It is
usualy, before sending it to table, to make a little hole in the top and fill it with brandy, then light
it, and serve it in a blaze. In olden time a sprig of arbutus, with a red berry on it, was stuck in the
middle, and a twig of variegated holly, with berries, placed on each side. This was done to keep
away witches...If well made, Christmas plum pudding will be good for twelve months."<br>

<b>When to make the Christmas pudding?</b><br>
Stir-Up Day is the name traditionally given to the day on which Christmas puddings are made in
England. This day moves according to the Christian calendar.
<p>
"Stir-Up Sunday, the last Sunday before Advent, is considered the final day on which one can
make the
Christmas fruit cakes and puddings that require time to be aged before being served. United
Kingdom...The
Collect of the Church of England for this Sunday begins, "Stir up, we beseech thee, O Lord, the
wills of they
faithful people, what they plenteously bring forth the fruit of good works..." This prayer was
parodied by the
choirboys: "Stir up, we beseech thee, the pudding in the pot. And when we do get nome tonight,
we'll eat it
up hot."  The Christmas pudding is traditionally "stirred up" on this day. All family members must
take a
hand in the stirring, and a special wooden spoon (in honor of Christ's crib) is used. The stirring
must be in a
clockwise direction, with eyes shut, while making a secret wish. Source: The Customs and
Ceremonies of
Britain by Charles Knightly. London:Thames and Hudson, 1986, p. 211."<br>
---<i>The Folklore of World Holidays</i>, Robert H. Griffen and Ann H. Shurgin editors, Second
Edition

<p>
"In England some people still refer to the Sunday before the beginning of Advent as "Stir-Up
Sunday"...In
past times the words "stir up"...reminded people to begin preparing their Christmas
puddings...Children
chanted a rhymed verse on that day that mixed the words of the collect with requests for special
Christmas
fare...Thus, the preparation of the Christmas pudding eventually became associated with this day.
Folk
beliefs advised each member to take a turn stirring the pudding, and ace that was believed to
confer good
luck. Another custom encouraged stirrers to move the spoon in clockwise motion, close their
eyes, and
make a wish."<br>

<p>
<b>How was the pudding stored until Christmas in the "old days?"</b><br>
Excellent question! Interesting to report that none of our UK/USA cookbooks (16th-19th century) address this thorny issue. Based on instructions for preparing pre-industrial alcohol-based items (most notably fruits), we presume after the puddings were they were baked/boiled/steamed, 
they were wrapped in alcohol-soaked (cheese?) cloth in and stored earthenware/crockery and placed somewhere cool for the duration. It is possible more alcohol 
was added during this period. It is also possible the puddings were sealed against air (suet, wax) to prevent bacteria growth. Pure alcohol has long been recognized
 for its preserving qualities.

<a name="christmascharms">
<b>Christmas pudding charms</b><br>
The tradition of inserting inedible trinkets into holiday foods is ancient. It descends from pagan
rituals for good luck and fortune. The bean inserted into <a href="christmasfood.html#twelfthnight">Twelfth Night/King Cake
cake</a> and coin baked in the <a href="http://www.saintbasilacademy.org/about_us/vasilopita">Greek New Year Vasilopita
</a> are similar in function.
<p>
It is difficult to pinpoint the genesis of inserting charms (coins, thimbles, rings) into Christmas
pudding. Some sources say it developed in Victorian England; others date the practice to the 
Stuart period. Like their ancient counterparts, pudding charms were meant to bring luck to their
finders. Today, the practice is generally skipped for health and safety reasons. Our survey of 19th
century English cookbooks reveals primary sources do not provide instructions for the insertion
of coins (Christmas pudding) or beans (Twelfth Night Cake).
<p>
"As with the Christmas Clootie pudding in Scotland, the English Christmas pudding
usually includced small trinkets that told one's fortune. After the family had all participated in stirring the batter, the mother would
secretly drop in a thimble (for spinsterhood), a ring (for marriage), a coin (for wealth), a miniature horeshoe (for good
luck), and various other items to be found by the diners during the Christmas feast itself."<br>
---<i>Food and Cooking in Victorian England: A History</i>, Andrea Broomfield [Praeger:Westport CT] 2007 (p. 150) 
<p>
"Another important addition to the mixture is an old coin, which is cooked in the pudding. It will
supposedly bring wealth to whoever finds it on their plate on Christmas Day. An old silver
sixpence or threepenny bit is the traditional coin, but a thoroughly washed 10p piece will do. Just
make sure everyone knows it's there and warn them to look out for it when tucking into the pud. 
Other traditional additions to the pudding include a ring, supposed to foretell a marriage, and a
thimble for a lucky life. If you're worried your guests may swallow them by mistake you could
wrap all these lucky charms in little packages of greaseproof paper before stirring them in. (It's
probably best to leave them out altogether if small children will be eating the pudding, or just sit
them on the side of their plates so they're easy to spot.)"<br>

"Though it might be hot on Christmas day, and some Australians have been known to have
Christmas dinner on the beach, there are few who would allow Christmas to pass without hot
Christmas pudding. All Christmas puddings are variations of what the English call Plum Pudding,
although there are no plums in the mixture. Christmas pudding is a special favorite of both old and
young...The kids can hardly contain themselves, because Christmas pudding is always served with
small coins hidden inside! (Only silver coins are used, which in Australia are 5, 10, and 20 cent
pieces, though the 20 cent pieces are a bit large for this.) Yes, it can be dangerous, and we have
known kids who have swallowed the 5 cent pieces (the smallest coin) and had to be rushed to the
doctor. But nothing ever happens, not even a tummy ache. However, if you decide to try you
hand at this fun tradition, we suggest that you issue several warnings to your excited guests,
adults as well as kids. Also, in the olden days when coins were pure silver (or close to it) the coins
were cooked right in the pudding. This is no longer a good idea because the alloys in the coins
will leave a nasty taste! Boil the coins separately, then just before serving the pudding, order
everyone out of the kitchen, and wedge the coins into the pudding. With a little care, one can hide
the coins to they cannot be seen too easily--although the kids are pretty hard to fool. There are a
lot of different traditions in families in regard to what to hide in the pudding. We know of one
strange family that hid a bone button in the pudding. The person who got it was said to have a
poor year next year! So much for good will to all men!"<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366">Feast of the Seven Fishes</font><br>
Why do Italian's eat seven different kinds of fish on Christmas Eve? 
According to the food historians, the number seven represents the number of sacraments in the Roman Catholic Church. Fish 
is generally connected with fasting. Traditionally, the 
period before a Christian celebration is observed with simple, lean foods. Lent & Easter are the most renown of examples.
<p>
"Dishes served on the eve of a religious festival are meant to purify the body in observance of the Church's injunction to eat  lean
foods...while the actual holiday is a gastronomic extravaganza with rich meats and fatty foods...Christmas is a two-day feast of massive
quantites and opulent dishes. Most dishes are stricly tied to local tradition, but a few have become national symbols...Eel, is the 
traditional fish of Christmas Eve in the south...Religious festivals have always had a special menu and none more so that
Christmas Eve, La Vifilia, ostensibly a penitential meal, is often composed of a ritual number of course: 7 for the seven
sacraments, 9 for the Trinity multiplied by itslef, 12 for the disciples, 13 adds Jesus, and 21 multiplies the Trinity by the
seven sacraments. Southern Italians celebrate Christmas Even with Il Cenone, a big dinner serving a sequence of fish courses, which
always include eel, capitone, served grilled, spit roasted, roasted, fried, stewed in umido, or pickled. Almost as
likely to be present on the Christams Eve table is baccala, the quintessential fasting food, served in tomato suace in 
Naples, with potatoes and onions in Basilicata, and stewed in brodetto in the Marche. In Apulia, the meal is composed of seven or
nine fish, each cooked in a different matter, while in Abruzzo, the seven or nine courses include roasted eel and fried
baccala along with fish and shellfish roasted, fried, marinated, or served in broth."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Italian Food</i>, Gillian Riley [Oxford University Press:New York] 2007 (p. 193)
<p>
"All over Italy, eel is the traditional centerpiece of the Roman cenone, as the big Christmas Eve dinner is known. The banquet 
seems to have originated in the fifth or sixth century when the pope said three masses on Christmas Eve; wherever he went
for mass, they set out a banquet. Romans have an enormous fondness for eel...The eel certainly comes form a pre-Christian cult,
a water snake that was known and consumed during the time of the Etruscans; now it is a ritual food in which the sacred and profane
meet...In Abruzzo, where tradition prevails, people prepare Christmas Eve meals with the required seven or nine dishes--seven for the 
seven virtues or the seven sacrament...Courses included fedelini with a sauce of anchovies or sardines, roasted eel, and various
fish that are fried, roasted, marinated, or served in broth. (Baccala, the quintessential fasting food, appears as well.)"<br>

edge so that they will protrude from the pastry. The fish are covered with slices of hard-boiled egg, a little cider is poured over to moisten them, and 
the whole is covered with short crust pastry (sometimes a thin layer is also put underneath), brushed with milk, and baked in a moderate 
oven for about 1 hour. Springs of parsley are often put into the fishes' mouths as a garnish after cooking. (It is not unusual for a thick 
layer of breadcrumbs to be used instead of the bottom layer of pastry, and for the top crust to be made of mashed potato.)<br>

"Star-Gazy Pie's history is a cousin to Hevva Cake. One Christmas about 200 years ago, the fishing village of Mousehole, near 
Penzance, was threatened with starvation. Crops were poor and the weather so stormy that ships had not been able to leave harbor. Tom 
Bawcock--desperate, brave, and determined--rounded up a crew willing to brave the storms. Against th odds, they returned safely and 
loaded down with seven kinds of fish. The date was December 23. Ever since then, the village of Mousehole has celebrated 
Christmas Eve's eve as Tom Bawcock's Eve. The traditional meal is this fish pie made with seven kinds of fish and a 
sturdy crust, constructed with fish heads emerging from the crust to gaze at the stars." <br>

"Star-Gazy Pie (a favourite Cornish dish)</b>. This pie is thus named because the heads of the fish are usually placed mouth uppermost in the 
centre of the lid of the crust, as pigeon's legs are in a pigeon pie, and therefore the fish are supposed to be gazing at the 
sky or the stars. Takes as many fresh herrings or mackerel as will fill a moderate-sized dish. Scale, empty and open them, and remove the 
bones. Lay them flat on the table, season the inside of each with salt, cayenne, and chopped parsley and roll it up neatly. Butter the 
pie dish, and sprinkle upon it a thick layer of finely-grated bread-crumbs, lay in some of the fish, and fill the dish with 
alternate layers of the pie with a few slices of fat bacon or the fat of a ready-dressed ham, and pour over all six eggs beaten up with two 
tables-spoonfuls of tarragon vinegar, or, if preferred, half a quarter of a pint of cream. Cover the dish with a good crust, and 
bake the pie in a well-heated oven. Arrange the heads of the fish in the centre of the pastry; when the pie is baked put a piece of 
parsley into the mouth of each fish, and serve. Time, one hour to an hour and half."<br>

Sugarplums belong to the <a href="christmasfood.html#comfits">comfit family</a>, a confection traditionally composed of tiny sugar-coated
seeds. The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> defines the word sugarplum thusly: "A small round or oval
sweetmeat, made of boiled sugared and variously flavoured and coloured; a comfit." The earliest
mention of this particular food is 1668. The term also has another meaning "Something very
pleasing or agreeable; esp. when given as a sop or bribe," which dates to 1608. 
     <p>
"Sugarplums were an early form of boiled sweet. Not acutally made from plums...they were
nevertheless roughly the size and shape of plums, and often had little wire stalks' for suspending
them from. They came in an assortment of colours and flavours, and frequently, like comfits, had
an aniseed, caraway seed, etc. at their centre. The term was in vogue from the seventeenth to the
nineteenth centuries, but is now remembered largely thanks to the Sugarplum Fairy, a character in

<b>What are comfits?</b><br>
"Comfit, an archaic English word for an item of confectionery consisting of a seed, or nut coated
in several layers of sugar...In England these small, hard sugar sweets were often made with
caraway seeds, known for sweetening the breath (hence  kissing confits). Up to a dozen coats of
syrup were needed before the seeds were satisfactorily encrusted. Comfits were eaten a sweets,
and also used in other sweet dishes; for example seed cake was made with caraway comfits rather
than loose caraway seeds as in the 19th century. Confectioners as early as the 17th century
recognized by varying the proportions of sugar in the syrup they could change the final texture,
making  pearled comfits or  crisp and ragged comfits. The word  comfit remained in use in
English up until the 20th century: Alice, of Alice in Wonderland, has a box of comfits in her
pocket."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
208)
<p>
<b>Why call them comfits?</b><br>
"The latin word conficere was used to describe the act of puttng together, making up or compounding their potions. From that were 
derived the English terms to confect and confection. Another one, comfit, came from the Latin in a more roundabout fashion, for 
its immediate root was the French confit. Used at first for fruits preserved in sugar, comfit soon defined sugar-covered spices 
(pills in other words)...By the end of the fifteenth century, confection had acquired the meaning of a sweetmeat. In the
early seventeeth century, the terms comfit-maker and confectioner both described people who made sweets."<br>

[NOTE: The word <a href="foodmeats.html#confit">confit</a>, decending from the same root, applies to a
savory potted fowl.]
<p>
<b>Early manufacturing processs</b><br>
"Comfit making demanded both leisure and special equipment; a ladle, a slice, a basin to heat the
sugar suspended from cords over another bowl containing hot coals, and yet another basin in
which the seeds, fruits or spices were treated. Molten sugar was ladled over them, and after each
application they had to be dried and cooled. Several coats of sugar were needed.  Caraways will
be fair at twelve coats; and even  crisp and ragged comfits, for which the sugar was boiled to a
greater height, required eight to ten coats. Fortunately there were professional confectioners in
the larger towns. So the gentle woman unequaled to the task of creating her own banqueting fare
could purchase it herself, or commission kinsfolk or friends to bring back sweetmeats when they
travelled on business."<br>

<b>Italian confetti</b><br>
"Confetti (comfits in English) are nuts or seeds or spices with a coating of hard sugar. The best known in 
Italy today are probably the sugared almonds which are sent to relatives to celebrate weddings and similar joyful life
events. The little circles of coloured paper tossed over the bride at weddings are a substitute for the ancient custom of
scattering seeds and ritual breads, symbols of fertility and renewal, which predate Christian ceremonies. The combination of
seeds and sugar was quite potent, and apart from their symbolic value, confetti were made and used by apothecaries as both
medicine and gtreats; they were offered at the end of lavish banquets, as exquisite morels and soothing digestives, and brought in to offer
visitors coming to pay the ritual congratulatory visit to women after childbirth. In Florence in 1471, Ser Girolamo di Ser Diovanni
di Ser Taddeo de Colle, a comfortably off notary, paid a large sum of money for confetti (also known as treggea or manuscristi) as
his wife Catereina went into labour...The sweetmeats brought by guests would have included confetti...
The making of confetti was slow and laborous, the seeds or nuts to be coated were put into a sugar syrup at the manuscristi stage...and 
swirled and tossed in a concave metal tray suspended over a low heat...confetti went through this treatment over and over again, eacy layer
of sugar had to dry out completely before the next coating, and many coatings were needed."<br>

"The production of comfits and confections in Sicily probably kept pace with the production of sugar itself. This was greatly

local consumption. Nonetheless, knowledge and techniques survived, ready to accompany the extroadinar expansion in sugar production that began at
the end of the fourteenth century, and to satisfy the requirements of the newly established royal court. Comfits always appeared among the 
gifts that the city of Palermo presejted to royal amassadors and other VIPs. In 1417 the wife of a viceroy received a tribute of

The cake is a basic yeast-based <a href="foodbreads.html#brioche">brioche</a> filled
with dried fruits and nuts. The recipe descends from Ancient Arab recipes. The practice of
serving this particular cake, often with a prize or bean inside, around Christmas time
predates Christian times. Ancient Romans served a similar item. The traditional King Cake, as
we know it today, was made by Christians throughout most of Europe by the Middle Ages.
King cakes were introduced to America by European settlers. In places settled by Spanish
missionaires (Mexico, South America, Florida, California), rosca de reyes was served. In the
United States, the <a href="christmasfood.html#kingcake">King Cakes</a> of New Orleans are probably
the most well known. German/Bavarian

"Twelfth-Night Cake. In many countries it was customary to celebrate Ephiphany with a feast on
its eve, or Twelfth Night. A central feature of these festivities was a cake in which a bean or token
was hidden. He who found it in his piece of cake was named lord of the evening's entertainments
and could command guests to do his bidding. In France the cake was known as gateau des rois, or
king's cake, in honour of the Wise Men, whose feast Epiphany is; in Louisiana it is "king cake"; in
Germany it is Dreikongskuchen; it is the Black Bun in Scotland; in Portugal it is bola-rei; and in
Spain it is rosca de reyes."<br>

"A long succession of mock kings have ruled over winter holiday merrymaking in Europe. 
In ancient times they presided over feasts held in honor of the Roman festival of
Saturnalia...In the Middle Ages the boy bishop and the Lord of Misrule directed certain
Christmas festivities...Twelfth Night celebrations, however, came under the special
supervision of another mock ruler: the King of the Bean. In past centuries, the English,
French, Spanish, German and Dutch celebrated Twelfth Night, or Epiphany Eve, with a feast.
The Twelfth Night cake not only provided dessert, but also helped to facilitate an old
custom...While preparing the cake the cook dropped a bean, coin or other small object in to
the batter. The man who found the object in his slice of cake was declared "King of the
Bean." If a woman received the bean, she became queen and appointed a man as king...The
king presided over the rest of the evening's activities...Christmas season mock kings sprouted
up regularly in mediveal Europe. Records indicate that in late medieval France thse kings were
selected by a kind of edible lottery...In the sixteenth century, ordinary Dutch and German
households celebrated Twelfth Night by baking a coin into a cake and acknowledging whoever
received the coin in their slice of cake as king of the feast. In the next century, this Twelfth
Night custom spread to England, France, and Spain..."<br>

"King cake. A brioche-style cake made during the Louisiana carnival season, beginning in January
and ending at Mardi Gras...By tradition the cake contains a red bean (sometimes covered in gold
or silver lear) or a figurine of the baby Jesus. It is sold widely throughout Louisiana...the person
who finds the bean or figurine is prmosed good luck. There are various stories as the the origins
of ther cake, though most in some way derive from the legend of the Three Kings visiting the
infant Jesus in Bethlehem, as described in the New Testament. In the first half of the sixteenth
century France commemorated Kings' Day--the twelfth day after Christmas--with a "Twelfth
Night cake." A century later King Louis XIV took part in such a feast at which gateau des Rois
("Kings' cake") contained a hidden bean or creamic figure, as it does to this day. Before the Civil
War American King cakes often contained gold, diamonds, or valuable instead of beans; after the
war, with the end of gala Creole balls in Louisiana, peas, beans, pecans, and coins were used, and
in 1871 the tradition of choosing the queen of the Mardi Gras was determined by who drew the
prize in the cake...The colors of purple (for justice), green (for faith). And gold (for power) that
traditionally tint the cake's icing first appeared in 1872 after the Rex Krewe, a Mardi Gras parade
organization, chose those colors to celebrate that year's festival."<br>

can scarcely fail to be satisfactory, and a considerable saving may be effected, compared
considerable saving may be effected, compared with what the same cake would have cost if
bought at a confectioner's. Before beginning to mix the cake all the ingredients would be
prepared, the flour dried and sifted, the currants washed. Dried, and picked, the nutmegs grated,
the spices pounded, the candied fruit cut into thin slices, the almonds bruised with orange-flour or
rose water, but not to a paste, the sugar sifted, and the eggs thoroughly whisked, yolks and whites
separately. Care should be taken to make the cake and to keep the furit in a warm place, and,
unless the weather is very warm, to whisk the eggs in a pan set in another containing hot water.
To make the cake, pug two pounds of fresh butter into a large bowl, then add two pounds of
powdered sugar, a large nutmeg grated, and a quarter of an ounce each of powdered sinnamon,
powdered mace, powdered ginger, and powdered allspice. Beat the mixture for ten minutes, add
gradually twenty eggs, and beat the cake for twenty minutes. Work in two pounds of flour, four
pounds of currants, half a pound of bruised almonds, half a pound each of candied citron, and, last
of all, a claret-glassful of brandy, and beat the cake lightly with doubled paper well buttered, pour
in the mixture, and be careful that it does no more than three-parts fill it, that there may be room
for the cake to rise. Cover the top with paper, set the tin on an inverted plate in the oven to keep
it from burning at the bottom, and bake in a slow but well-heated oven. When it is nearly cold,
cover it as smoothly as possible with sugar-icing three quarters of an inch thick...Ornament with
fancy articles of any kind, with a high ornament in the centre; these may frequently be hired of the

the centre of it, and if it comes out bright and clear the cake is done. A cake of this description
will, if properly made, and kept in a cool dry place, keep for twelve months. If cut too soon it will
crumble and fall into pieces. It will be at it its best when it has been kept four months."<br>

"Twelfth Night or King's Cake</b> [complete recipe & notes] <br>
Gateau de Roi.<br>
2 Pounds of the Best Flour.<br>
12 Eggs. <br>
1 cup of Sugar.<br>
1 Pound of the Best Butter.<br>
1/2 Ounce of Salt.<br>
Candies to Decorate.<br>
This is a Creole Cake whose history is the history of the famous New Orleans carnivals celebrated
in song and stories. The "King's Cake," or "Gateaux de Roi," is inseparably connected with the
origin of our now world-famous carnival balls. In fact, they owe their origin to the old Creole
custom of choosing a king and queen on King's Day, or Twelfth Night. In old Creole New
Orleans, after the inauguration of the Spanish domination and the amalgamation of the French
settlers and the Spanish into that peculiarly chivalrous and romantic race, the Lousiana Creole, the
French prettily adapted many of the customs of their Spanish relatives and vice versa. Among
these was the traditional Spanish celebration of King's Day, "Le Jour des Rois," as the Creoles
always term the day. King's Day falls on January 6, or the twelfth day after Christmas, and
commemorates the visit of the three Wise Men of the East to the lowly Bethlehem manger. This
day is even in our time still the Spanish Christmas, when gifts are presented in commemoration of
the King's gifts. With the Creoles it became "Le Petit Noel," or Little Christmas, and, adopting
the Spanish custom, there were always grand balls on Twelfth Night: a king and a queen were
chosen, and there were constant rounds of festivities, night after night, till the dawn of Ash
Wednesday. From January 6, or King's Day, to Mardi Gras Day became the accepted carnival
season. Each week a new king and queen were chosen, and no royal rulers ever reigned more
happily than did these kings and queens of a week. <p>
     "The method of first choosing the king was by cutting the "King's Cake." This famous
"Gateau de Roi" was made of Brioche Batter...It was an inmense cake, shaped round like a great
ring, and decorated with bonbons, dragees, caramels, etc. When Twelfth Night arrived there was
always a flutter in old Creole New Orelans. Generally some grand mansion was chosen for the
first ball, an das the evening progressed, wehn the clock struck twelve, the guests were all invited
to be seated around the spacious dining-room, where the "King's Cake" was brought in. Now,
hidden away or often as not a magnificent jeweled ring. The cake was cut into as many slices as
there were guests, the smiling cavaliers and the lovely Creole maidens ranged around, each of the
latter cherishing the wistful hope that she might find the bean, each of the former hoping likewise
that he might have the pleasure of choosing as his queen some lovely girl who held his heart. The
cake, after being cut, was covered with a large linen napkin, so that no one might have the
opportunity of seeing if the dainty morsel had been cut near the ring or bean, for often the knife
went very, very near, and the dexterious maniuplator, with a smile, had to remove it an inch
further from the mark. But it was generally so imbedded in the cake that it was impossible to
detect the least trace. Champage was passed with the King's Cake, for was it not a royal dish?
Suddenly there would be a little flutter. Some one had found the ring or bean, and all gathered
around to congratulate the fortunate finder. If a man, he was hailed as the first king of the season,
and so, if it were a lady, she was saluted as the queen. If the finder of the bean were a lady, she
simply chose her king by presenting him with a bouquet of violets, which was always provided
wiih the cake. If a gentleman found the ring or bean, the crowned king would hold it up, and
announce that the lady with whom he would make the round of the parlor or "le tour du salon"
would be his queen. Then he would take his stand near the mantel, the music would strike up, and
the beautiful promenade around the room would begin, the gentlemen offering their arms to the
ladies, the latter laughingly complying with the old custom of passing before the king while he
chose his queen. No doubt there was much secret vexation among those bonny girls as they
passed on and on, the king seemingly unable to make a choice. Suddenly he advanced, and, taking
the flower form the lapel of his coat, he presented it to the lady, and, if it happened to be a ring in
the cake, often as not it was a magnificent diamond, to, that he presented to her. Then offering his
arm, he led the promenade, making as he said, "le tour du salon" with her, and then pausing
beneath the chandeliers, he would raise his hand, the music would cease, and the king would
proclaim: "Mes sujets, voice votre reine! Receves ses commandments!" Then followed and
ovation of smiles, congratulations and homage, as though she were indeed a queen succeding to
her born rights. And the honors of that night clung to her ever after, amid sunshine and clouds in
the old French Quarter. <p>
     "The prettiest old-time courtesies were connects with the round of balls that followed. These
balls were always given at the home of the queen. The king, whether he found the bean or was
simply whose by the lady who had found it, was expected to bear the entire expense of the ball of
which he was the king, and to provide the next King's Cake. He as also expected, before the end
of the week, to make his queen some beautiful jewels form the king were the only ones that the
Creole mother ever allowed her daughters to accept from any gentleman. In this custom of
presenting the queen of the week with jewels may be distinctly traced the present custom of our
Carnival kings in presenting the queens with jewels.<p>
     "And so, week after week, the festivities continued: a King's Cake was cut, a new king and
queen was chosen, and this continued till ther grand culminating ball of Mardi Gras night. <br>
     "A pretty superstition was also connected the King's Cake. The lucky finder of the pecan, or
bean, or ring, which was hidden within was henceforth to be favored by fortune. The queen cut
the bean in two, and gave half of it to her king, and or, if a gentleman found it. The lucky bean
was faithfully preserved as a talisman,  and in many an old Creole family a little shriveled amulet
which  was found in the Gateau de Roi on Twelfth Night.<p>  
     "To make the cake, take a pound and a half of the above-mentioned quality of flour, and put it
in a woodedn bread trough. Make a hole in the center of the flour, and put in a slf ounce of yeast,
dissolved in a little warm water. Add milk or tepid water to make the dough, usuing milk if oyu
want it to be very rich and delicate, and water if you have not the milk. Knead and mix the flour
with one hand, while adding the milk or water with the other. Make a dough that is neither too
stiff nor too soft, and when perfectly smooth set the dough to rise in a moderately warm place,
covering with a cloth. Remember that if you use milk to make the dough it must be scalded, that
is, must be heated to the boiling point, and then allowed to grow tepid. Let the dough rise for five
or six hours, and, when increased to twice its bulk, take it and add the reserved half pound of
flour,  into which you have sifted the salt. Add six eggs, beaten very light with the sugar and
butter, and mix all well together, kneading lightly with your hands, and adding more eggs if the
dough is a little stiff. The knead the dough by turning it over on itself three times, and set to rise
again for an hour or three-quarters of an hour. Cover with a cloth. At the end of this time take it
up and work again lightly, and then form into a great ring, leaving of course, a hole in the center.
Pat gently and flatten a little. Have ready a baking pan, with a buttered sheet of paper in it, and set
the central roll in the middle. Cover the pan with a clean, stiff cloth, and set the cake to rise for an
hour longer. When well risen, set in an oven a few degrees cooler than used for baking bread; let
bake for an hour and a half; if medium, one hour, and if very small, a half hour. Glace the Brioche
lightly with a beaten egg, spread lightly over the top before placing in the oven. Decorate with
daragees, caramels, etc."<br>

<b>Wassail</b><br>
The origin of Wassail likely descends from ancient rituals celebrating human connections with drink. Early recipes confirm ingredients were imported and expensive, 
and
connected with the winter Christian holidays of Christmas (Eve & Day), New Year's and Twelfth Night. Similar to <a href#plumpuddinng">Plum Pudding</a>. English settlers (not the Puritans!) brought this recipe & its traditions to the New World. 
What's the "original" recipe? Mrs. Glasse, Eliza Acton and other popular 18th century English cook book authors do not include Wassail in their works. They do, however,
grace us with recipes featuring the ingredients. Wassail recipes vary according to place, time and pocketbook. Forgiving and creative,
Wassail toasts good health. 
<p>
According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> (OED), the first definition of Wassail is "A salutation used when presenting a up of wine to a guest, or drinking the health of a person,
the reply being drink-hail." This dates in print to the late 13th century. The second OED definition is "The liquid in which healths were drunk; esp. the spiced
also used in Twelfth-night and Christmas-eve celetrations." The Henry VII (see 1494) print evidence is offered.
<p>
<b>[1494]</b><br>
"Another tradition associated with Christmas was that of wassailing. The was the remains of old fertility rites, when a toast would be drunk to fruit trees in hope of
making them produce a good crop in the following year. Whatever its origins, it was certainly an opportunity for plenty of drinking. There was no one traditional wassail
up for the whose country as every region had its own particular tradition. The wassail cup might of cider, ale, or some spiced ale such as lambswool, a kind of spiced 
beer which was served warm. Wassailing was a part of Christmas for everyone, from highest to the lowest. Even at Court the tradition was maintained. Here is the 
description of Henry VII's wassail, from the Household Ordinances of 1494: 'Item as for the voide on twelfth day at night, the King and Queene ought to take it in the
halle, and as for the wassel, the Steward and the treasurer shall come forward with their staves in their hands...when the Steward cometh into the hall doore with the
wasssel he must crie three times, wassell, wassell, wassell aand then the chappell to answere with a good songe.' This strick etiquette must have made Henry VII's wassail 
a vastly more formal occasion than the one his subjects enjoyed."<br>

"Wassail Bowl.--The wassail used in ancient days used to be served specially on Christmas Eve. It was brought into the banqueting hall this songs and carols, and crowned
with garlands. To make it, grate half a nutmeg, and put it into a saucepan with one clove, a quarter of an ounce of grated ginger, half a small blade of mace,
an inch of thick cinnammon, and two or three coriander and cardamom seeds. Pour upon these ingredients a teacupful of cold water, and let them boil. Then add two
bottles of white wine, not sweet, and three-quarters of a pound of refined sugar. Pour the mixture into a large saucepan, and set it on the fire. Break the yolks
of six and the whites of three eggs into the wassail bowl. When the wine is warm, mix a tea-cupful of it in a bowl with the eggs; when it is a little warmer, add
another tea-cupful, and repeat until five tea-cupfuls have been used. Let the wine boil, and our it upon the eggs, stirring brisk all the time to froth it. Core, but
do not pare, six apples fill the cavity with sugar, roast them, and throw them into the bowl. Serve very hot. Though sherry or madeira will make an excellent wassail,

"The Wassail bowl was an ancient ritual started on Christmas day. It was called Waeshal--meaning 'Be whole' and at every Christmas gathering the toasting or Wassail bowl
of spiced wine was present. During the time of Henry VII on Christmas day a steward would enter and say, 'Wassail,' three times and then a large golden bowl filled with
special beverage would be brought in with much singing, and the guests were then served from it. Today we do not have the ritual but we do have the punch bowl at
festive occasions. In most of America it has been the custom for neighbors and friends to pay Christmas calls. Each house generally has a bowl or container of Christmas
eggnog, punch &c. Times and cellars change a great many of the concoctions of the Christmas Bowl."<br>

"In ancient times the wassail bowl presented at all holiday festivities. Wassail [pronounced wa'sel] meant literally 'health to you'. Drinking the hot spiced wine and
alw was a tiast to the health of one's friends. Even today the wassial bow is brought out at Christmas.. The beverage may be the hot spiced wine and ale of tradition,
or something milder, say, cider, with baked apples in it. The apples are an old English tradition. Perhaps you'd rather float lemon or orange slices in your
Christmas wassail. That's all right too. Get out the punch bowl and cups. In any event. Have your friends in on Christmas eve, Christmas afternoon or any convenient time
until after New Year's and serve then something warm, spicy, and fragrant. The old wassail was heated with a red hot poker from the fireplace, over an open fire.

<b>MEDIEVAL EUROPEAN CHRISTMAS</b><br>
What people ate for Christmas in Medieval times depended greatly upon who they were
(peasants, merchants, nuns, lords, kings) and where they lived (England? France? Germany?
Spain?). One must also consider the fact that some Christian holidays were celebrated in much
longer periods than a single day. The Christmas season officially extends until Twelfth Night. This
was another grand meal with its own unique traditions. Today some cultures still celebrate
Twelfth night by serving a <a href="christmasfood.html#twelfthnight">King Cake</a>.
<p>
<b>MEDIEVAL ENGLISH CHRISTMAS FOODS & CUSTOMS</b><p>

"At Christmas it was frequently the custom for each [peasant] tenant to give to the lord a hen
(partly as payment for being allowed to keep poultry), or sometimes grain which was brewed into
ale...At Christmas also the lord was expected to give his tenants a meal, for example, bread,
cheese, pottage and two dishes of meat. The tenant might be directed to bring his own plate, mug
and napkin if he wished there to be a cloth on the table, and a faggot of brushwood to cook his
food, unless he wished to have it raw. Sometimes the custom said explicitly that the lord had to
give a Christmas meal because the tenant had given him the food. In at least one instance the
value of the food to be provided by the lord was to be the same value as that given by the tenant.
The role of the lord in this case appears to have been merely to organize the village Christmas
dinner. The value of the dinner was not always so finely balanced as this however: sometimes the
lord gained, sometimes the tenant. These customs were maintained for several centuries, lasting in
some cases after the end of the manorial system when compulsory work had been commuted into
the paying of rent."<br>
---<i>Food and Feast in Medieval England</i>, P.W. Hammond [Wren's Park:Gloucestershire]
1993 (p. 36)
<p>
"Almonds and raisins were also bought at Christmas, perhaps for a Christmas pudding.  Apart
from this there is no sign that they [the gentry] celebrated Christmas by eating anything very
different from their normal diet. This is presumably not due to their religious status, since this did
not inhibit other ecclesiastical establishments. For example, in 1289 Richard de Swinfield, the
Bishop of Hereford, spent Christmas at his manor of Prestbury, near Gloucester. The day before
Christmas was kept as a fast, but a considerable amount of fish, herrings, conger eels and codlings
were eaten, together with a salmon costing 5s. 8d. (28p, quite a high price). A dozen cups, 300
dishes, 150 large plates and 200 small plates were obtained for the occasion. There were a number
of guests--at least fifteen judging by the number of extra horses in the stable for the next two
days. On the following day (Christmas Day) even more food was consumed. Over three days they
ate no less than 1 boar, 2 complete carcasses and 3 quarters of beef, 2 calves, 4 does, 4 pigs,
about 60 fowls (hens or possibly capons), 8 partridges and 2 geese, as well as bread and cheese.
The amount of ale served was not recorded, but ten sextaries (about 40 gallons) of red wine and
one of white were consumed. This is a fairly modest amount for about 70 people. On such
occasions the wine was sometimes only served to the bishop and the most important guests. The
amount of food was also considerable and (as the editor of the account suggests), probably a large
amount was give to the poor, or perhaps to the manor tenants. Spices, such as ginger, cloves and
cinnamon, saffron and mustard were also purchased. They did not need to buy very much pepper
since 1/2 lb of pepper cloves formed part of their original endowment. Spices always formed part
of the diet of the gentry and magnate households, presumably because they liked the flavour these
gave to food."<br>
---<i>ibid</i> (p. 65)
<p>
"The Christmas holiday lasted only a few half-days for most people, because the usual daily farm and other labourers' work
and household chores went on, and not all employers gave much time off. But the courtly folk had ample leisure to display their new
headgear at one party after another over nearly a fortnight of intermittent feasting, and to enjoy the colourful, scented delights of 
top-class cuisine; even if their lowly rank entitled the on full-scale royal occasions to only two or three of the courses, and to a
limited choice of dishes (squires, pages, local burgesses and so on were allowed only one course.) There were sometimes 
entertainments to watch while waiting, and the entremets or subtleties to admire, especially if their labels were read aloud.
The boar's head brought in by carol singers at the Twelfth Night feast was a popular etremet, and so was the peacock, proudly
displayed regnant and bedecked on its platters...Entertainment was the main part of any feast, especially a great one; and at the end, when the alms 
baskets were carried out to the poor and the last Tweflth Night toast was drunk, it was to be hoped that one and all couls day, 'That
wqas a good feast. The year ahead will go well!"<br>

<p>
"Arthurian Christmas feasts swell the pages of medieval literature. One medieval romance begins
in the midst of Christmas revelry at Camelot, where King Arthur, his Knights of the Round Table
and their ladies are celebrating for 15 days, "with all the food and mirth that men knew how to
devise." Merriment notwithstanding, the medieval feast was often an occasion for great pomp and
ceremony. At 10 A.M. on Christmas Day, to the sound of clarion trumpets, the marshal would
usher guests into the castle's great hall, seating them at long tables according to the established
order of precedence. A bowl of spiced, scented water was circulated for the hand-washing
ceremony, and a Latin grace chanted in unison. Then the trumpets blared again, this time to
announce the arrival of servers as they entered the hall balancing steaming platters of spit-roasted
haunches, gilded fowl and enourmous crusty pies. Medieval feasts were traditionally served in
three courses. Each course included a soup, followed by a wide range of baked, roasted and
boiled dishes, and finally an elaborate sotelty, a lifelike (often edible) scene sculpted in colored
marzipan or dough. One 15th-century English menu suggests bringing each of the three courses to
a close with a sotelty depicting a successive phase of the Christmas story...The bounty of
medieval feasts is legendary. One early historian noted that in 1398, King Richard II "kept his
Christmas at Liechfield, where he spent [used] in the Christmas time 200 tunns of wine, and 2000
oxen with their appurtenances."<br>

"Christmas, then as now, 
had a variety of dishes associated with it. The first was the boar's head, which formed the centrepiece of the Christmas 
Day meal. It was garnished with rosemary and bay and evidently was presented to the diners with some style, as told by the
many boar's head carols which still exist...Thomas Tusser in Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry suggests a number of 
dishes, that, lower down society, the housewife should provide for her guests at Christmas. He mentions mutton, pork, veal 
souse (pickled pig's feet and ears), brawn, cheese and apples, although none of these items was connected especially with 
Christmas; they were all associated with feasting generally. He also talks of serving turkey, but only as a part of a list
of other luxurious items that the housewife should provide. It does not seem to be the centrepiece in the way that the

<b>MEDIEVAL ITALIAN CHRISTMAS FOOD AND CUSTOMS</b><p>

"The distinction between normal days and feast day can be noted in every kitchen...feast days
were observed in different ways and with varying degrees of frequency. For certain religions
holidays, the menu was ritualized. Lasagne at Christmas...when Messire Sozzo Bandinelli
assembed a brilliant court at Siena to celebrate his son Francesco's accession to knighthood on
Christmas Day 1326, the festivities were to last the whole preceding week, with tournaments,
exchanges of gifts, and banquets. The record contains the menus of three meat banquets (...with
600 on Christmas Day), and one for a day of abstinence (120 guests on Wednesday, Christmas
Eve). Days of penitence did not require forswearing banquets; it was enough to replace meat with
fish. Morever, as in othe literary texts, the chronicler mentions only the dishes reflecting festivity,
abundance, and knightly courtesy--in a word, the meat and fish dishes--from among all the foods
appearing on the banquet tables. At Siena in that December of 1326, the number of courses, as
they appear in the chronicler's simplified version, varied from three to five (on the great day
itself). At all the the meat banquets, boiled veal, roast capon, and game meats were served; for the
Christmas feast the vast quantity and variety of game are described in detail. Each day's menu is
distinguished by a particular dish: ravioli and ambrogino di polli...for the Tuesday, blancmange for
Christmas Day; pastelli on the Thursday. The banquets always ended with candied pears served
with treggea (sugared almonds), and were always preceded and followed by confetti: sugarcoated
whole spices. The meatless Christmas Eve menu was no less gala, with four courses. First,
following the confetti, came marinated tench and plates of chickpeas to the table, then roast eels,
and finally a compote with treggea, followed by the unvarying candied pears and confetti."<br>

"Food and drink played important roles in Christmas celebrations during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Christmas festivities often ended with a Twelfth Night banquet on the sixth of January, and the Christmas season was the time when the yeomanry and apprentices demanded finer quality bread and ale than they ordinarily received. This tradition, called "wassailing," provided an important opportunity for the gentry to demonstrate their hospitality. As Thomas Tusser counseled his readers, "At Christmas be merye, & thankful withall/& feast thy poore neighbors ye gret with ye small." Religious aspects of keeping Christmas changed during the seventeenth century, although many social customs like wassailing remained intact. Josiah King's book mocks those who would suppress Christmas. The Puritan jury members are all mean, among them Mr. Eat-alone, Mr. Hoord-corne, and Mr. Cold-kitchin, and they are replaced by Mr. Warm-gut, Mr. Neighbour-hood, and Mr. Open-house, who acquit Father Christmas. Brawn, made from force-fed boar meat and served with mustard sauce, is traditionally associated with Christmas in England. The plot of A Christmas messe involves a battle between the forces of King Brawn and King Beef for the place of first setting at the Christmas meal. The cook resolves the debate, and Brawn, assisted by Mustard, is sent in first, followed by Queen Mincepie. This play may well have been performed at a Cambridge college as an after-dinner lesson in debating. December's good cheer for Thomas Tusser's family included brawn pudding along with freshly killed beef, mutton, pork, veal, goose, capon, and turkey. Apples, cheese, and nuts with jolly carols end the "christmas husbandly fare." Tusser's plea for year-round hospitality makes sense in a world where fresh food was available only seasonally and enough to eat depended on a good harvest."

"The greatest of the feasts celebrated was Christmas. This, of course, covered twelve days, but unlike the modern Christmas the celebrations did not begin until 
Christmas Day itself. Advent was mostly a time of fasting, and as Advent only ended after mass on Christmas Day, the festivities could not begin before then. The
 two most celebrated days of Christmas were New Year and the final day of celebration, Twelfth Night...There was...a definate purpose to the Tudor Christmas. 
At a time when society was very strictly organized, Christmas acted as a kind of pressure-release valve, a time when everyhthing was turned on its head. There
 were different days when certain sections of society were allowed an unusual degree of freedom. Children, for example, had their day on 6 December, St. Nicholas 
Day...Christmas, then as now, had a variety of dishes associated with it. The first was the boar's head, which formed the centrepiece of the Christmas Day meal. 
It was garnished with rosemary and bay and evidently was presented to the diners with some style, as told by the many boar's head caorls which still exist...Thomas
 Tusser in <i>Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry</i> suggests a number of dishes, that, lower down society, the housewife should provide for her guests at 
Christmas. He mentions mutton, pork, veal souse (pickled pig's feet and ears), brawn, cheese and apples, although none of these items was connected especially
 with Christmas; they were all associated with feasting generally. He also talks of serving turkey, but only as a part of oa list of other luxurious items that the
 housewife should provide. It does not seem to be the centrepiece in the way that the boar's head was in grander circles. One important item associated with 
Twelfth Night was the Twelfth cake. This was a fruitcake into which an object or objects might be baked, These might be a coin, or coins, or a dried bean and
 pea, The idea was that whoever found the item in their piece of cake became the King of the Bean or Queen of the Pea. They would then become host and
 hostess for the evening's entertainments...Another tradition associated with Christmas was that of wassailing. This was the remains of old fertility rites, when a
 toast would be drunk to fruit trees in the hope of making them produce a good crop in the following year. Whatever its origins, it was certainly an opportunity for
 plenty of drinking...The wassail cup might be of cider, ale, or some spiced ale such as lambswool, a kind of spiced beer whcih was served warm. Wassailing was
 a part of Christmas for everyone, from the highest to the lowest."<br>

<b>Victorian English Christmas</B><BR>
When we think of this period, we often fondly recall the Christmas feast described in Charles Dicken's <i>A Christmas Carol</i>
The Cratchit family lovingly shared plump roast goose, oyster stuffing, mincemeat, Christmas (aka plum) pudding and Wassail. Is this what everyone ate? Likely not. 
England's Industrial Revolution 
created great social divisions based on economic station. As was traditional, people celebrated
Christmas with the very best meal they could afford. This does not mean they all ate the same foods. Tables set in 
wealthy houses differed greatly from those enjoyed by the middle class professionals, laboring folk, or workhouse poor. 
Have you ever wondered why the centerpiece of Bob Cratchit's holiday meal was a <a href="christmasfood.html#goose">Christmas goose</a>?
How could they afford <a href="foodmeats.html#oysterstuffing">oyster stuffing</a>?
<p>
Most of the "classic" Victorian menus and recipes printed in Victorian Christmas books,
magazines, and Web sites are dated 1860-1900. If you want to recreate and 1840s meal, as was
served in the Cratchit household in Charles Dickens' <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, the hard part
will be finding authentic menus from that decade. Two of the best primary sources for this
project are Alexis Soyer's <i>Shilling Cookery for the People</i>, published in London in 1854
and Charles Elme Francatelli's <i>A Plain Cookery Book for the Working Classes</i>, [1861].
These books were written for the working and middle classes, not the wealthy people with
servants. The recipes are economical and fairly plain, which means these foods were probably the
similar to those eaten by the Cratchits. Soyer's book contains a chapter titled "Soyer's New
Christmas Receipts." Unfortunately, there are no suggested menus in these sources. Facsimile
editions of these cookbooks were recently reissued by Pryor Publications [Kent, England]. Your
librarian can help you find a copies. 
<p>
For most K-12 projects, simple Victorian-era menus and recipes are probably *good enough* to
give your class a taste of the Dickens' era. You will have to make other adjustments anyhow...like
omitting brandy from your Christmas pudding and Madeira from your Wassail. Some popular
Victorian items may present new experiences to your students...oysters, for example. Does your
budget permit such extravagance? A goose perfect, but turkey is okay too. Skip the pheasant. We
suggest hot chocolate as your beverage. It was relatively new and very chic. Cider works well
too.
