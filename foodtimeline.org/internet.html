<b>When, where & why did cybercafes surface?</b><br>
1984, Los Angeles California, innovative courtesy service connecting Olympic diners with local food & way-back home. After that? Anything
was possible and everything happened. Cybercafe pioneers were artistic innovators, social educators, technology promoters and
corporate marketers. From day one, cybercafes were praised for making global connections and criticized for 
encouraging human isolation. People sharing common physical spaces choosing to interact with people in remote places 
is nothing new. This food
historian wonders if this is deja-vu all over again. Except for the Internet? 17th/18th century <a href="restaurants.html#coffee">coffee houses</a>
were not so very different in mission/purpose/accomplishment.

"ECI created the world's first cybercafe network in 1984. This was a concept of telecollaboration artists Kit Galloway & Sherrie Rabinowitz who were 
commissioned as part of the L.A. Olympics Arts Festival by the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art. The Electronic Cafe was maintained for seven weeks."

<a href="http://ecafe.com">The Electronic Cafe International</a>, founded by Kip Galloway and Sherrie Rabinowitz, Santa Monica, California.  
<p>
<b>[1993: ECI pushes virtual & physical boundaries]</b><br>
"Welcome to the Electronic Cafe International, where the orders of the day are strong coffee and cyberspace. A crowd of technophiles is here to absorb a 
demonstration of BodySynth, a device that converts muscle tension into music by running electrical signals through a computer and--of, suffice to say that you get 
the sounds of different instruments by flexing different muscle groups. Just to make things more interesting, a Videophone beams the performance to Amsterdam...Kit 
Galloway and Sherrie Rabinowitz, husband and wife, invented the Electronic Cafe International...What exactly is the Electonic Cafe? For starters, it's an actual
 place, tucked behind a dead-end street in an industrial district. it is indeed a cafe--at least to the extent that cake and espresso are served--but it's also jammed 
with video screens, camera equipment and computer monitors. The ECI is, in the words of its founders, 'a cafe for the global village.' This means you can do a lot of 
reaching out and touching on a global scale, aided by an extensive menu of state-of-the-art telecommunications equipment. As Galloway is fond of saying, 'coffee's 
a buck, Videophones $10 an hour, full-motion satellite, $48,000 an hour.' But the cafe's real focus runs toward more communal events, involving group 'telelinks' 
or 'videolinks' to other places around the world....Most of the events are performance-oriented...Europe is a vital techno-territory for the global cafe set. There are 
ECI affiliates at the Documenta 9 museum in Kassel, Germany, and La Cite Museum of Science and Industry in Paris--both with technology that oustrips the 
hardware at the mother cafe here. On the other hand, humble affairs such as Pepito's, the cafe outpost in Managua, Nicaragua, operate with little more than a 
Videophone and a Mr. Coffee. The Galloway and Rabinowitz are adamant that the network be inclusive, and not shun outlets that can't afford all the whiz-bang 
equipment. And so, several times a month, Galloway finds himself packaging up a Videophone and sending it by UPS to some remote corner of the globe.. A 
recurring link-up involves what must be some of the more communication-starved individuals around, namely the inhabitants of Biosphere II, who are eking out a 
hermetically sealed existance somewhere in the vicinity of Oracle, Ariz....The ECI grew out of a project commissioned by the Olympic Arts Committee in 1984. 
'We had state-of-the-art multimedia telecom isntallations in five real ma-and-pa restaurants in different ethnic areas of L.A...it was sort of virtual tourism.
 International visitors could electronically zip around town and figure out where they wanted to eat"...That installation lasted six weeks..."We wanted the next project
 to be permanent"...And so, the Electronic Cafe International officially opened its doors on New Year's Eve 1989, with its first New Year's Eve Telebration. 
Starting at about 5 a.m., Galloway, Rabinowitz and fellow revelers telelinked with every time zone on the planet, just as the New Year came into being in each time 
zone, from Australia to Hawaii."<br>

<b>[1994: High Tech Cafe, Dallas]</b><br>
"Welcome to the cafe of the Dallas Infomart, a convention and sales center known as a high-technology showcase for the latest in computer products and 
networking...Now, at the newly opened High Tech Cafe, business can literally bontinue over lunch, as customers at selected tables can download their food and
 their Internet mail at the same time--taking bytes beteween bites, as it were. 'Hi, I'm Tim, and I'll be your client-server this afternoon,' the waiter announced
 recently to a party of four at one of the restaurant's modem-ready tables...'may I get you a drink? An appetizer? An RJ-11 cable?' Power lunchers at the four 
seasons in New York have long had telephones at their tables, and in California the chirps of cellular phones and beepers mingles with the tinkling of ice cubes and
 silverware...But at the Infomart, a striking glass building at downtown's edge patterned after London's 19th-centruy Crystal Placace, the goal is to wine, dine and 
be on line....the hard-disk equivalent of the hard Rock Cafe...The restaurant has been around for nearly 10 years as High Tech Mex [est. 1984?]...After two weeks
 of renovation by volunteers from Infomart's staff, the restaurant reopened on August 19 as the High Tech Cafe. Telephone lines and power sources for laptop 
computers were strng beneath the central bank of tables. Broken computers from dusty storerooms were cannibalized...for spare parts to decorate the restaurant...
Armed with srewdrivers, the volunteers went to work creating the restaurant's new decor. The overhead lights are encased in the shells of old computer monitors.
 The green, leafy 'ferns' in the corner are made from green circuit boards and cables. Screens between the dining area and the bar--the Spacebar, to be exact--are 
made of mother boards from defunct computers and calculators. Instead of flowers on each table, there are vases filled with computer key caps gouged from 
outdated keyboards...A diner can start with WYSIWYG--geekspeak for 'what you see is what you get'--soup, onion token rings or a miltimedia salad. Perhaps a 
computer club sandwich, or CD ROM-ano chicken? Mr. Mudrone's signature desserts include the LAN Mine, the Overload and the Crash. At happy hour, 
patrons of the Spacebar can order drinks like Fatal Error, a Memory Problem and Virus Protection...Instead of wheeling around a dessert cart, Mr. Mudrone said,
 he would like to wheel out a multimedia laptop that shows the desserts on a high-resolution color screen. He is experimenting with voice recorders that would play
 his spoken descriptions of each daily special to customers, and allow customers to relay their menu selections either by voice or touch-screen computers. 'We 
thought about using Newtons for the waiters,'...referring to the hand-held computers that can beam files by infared link to a computer in the kitchen. But, perhaps 
because of the Neton's much-publicized problems with handwirting recognition, the idea died...'The problem is, the waiter could write 'hamburger' and the order 
could come bakc 'overshoes.'...While the clientele of the restaurant is drawn almost excluslive from the business and computer communities, restaurant managers
 hope the new decordand emnu will attract a broader base of customers...What's ahead from the cafe? Plans include a Doom Room, wehre individuals or groups 
can play Doom, a networked computer game that is phenomenally popular among the Internet's cognoscenti. Infomart officials and food-service managers are also 
discussing 'sponsored' tables, where diners would be able to explore various on-line services like Compuserve, Prodigy and American Online. For now, however, it
 is strictly B.Y.O.P.--bring our own portable. And the staff hopes to transform the restaurant's empty wall space into a showcase for computer memorobilia...The
 first treasure to go one display: a bottle of toner particles, vintage 1959, from the original Xerox copier machine."<br>

<b>London's Cyberia</b><br>
"Welcome to Cyberia, Britain's first cybercafe, where you can turn on, tune in and "surf" the information superhighway. The cafe concept, devised to make a
 computer environment less formidable, has been borrowed from California where "surfing" - or hopping between global databanks - is commonplace. Here in 
Whitfield Street, central London, over a cappuccino and an almond croissant, cognoscenti and novices alike can communicate with kindred spirits around the 
world. Even people with scant technical knowledge will be able to access international databanks and pick up "e-mail". The cafe, which opened over the weekend, 
will also offer an electronic dating service, a property noticeboard and free space for non-profit making organisations. Its co-founders Ewa Pascoe and Gene Teare 
believe this is the first centre in Britain to offer public facilities to access the Internet, the worldwide network through which you can swap information and "talk". 
People can walk in, sit down at a screen and - with a little tuition from an in-house expert - join 30 million Internet users. Whether they want a brief "chat" with a 
friend in Chicago via e-mail (computer message services which transmit words, pictures and graphics between machines in seconds) or a detailed print-out of data 
downloaded from the library of Congress in Washington DC, Cyberia can deliver. The cafe can also provide Internet users (or "netties") with an electronic mailbox.
 Six people can use the computers at a time and if the demand is as great as Ms Pascoe hopes, users will have to book slots to save queuing. But she wants to go
 further than provide a room with computers and coffee to create a technology centre with a conscience. In addition to being a cognitive psychologist, computer 
programmer and researcher of risk assessment software at City University, she particularly wants to encourage women. Angered and frustrated by the male 
domination of computer technology - only 4 per cent of Internet users in Britain are women - she wants to redress the balance, as well as offering environmental 
groups easy and cheap access to information. "I believe in technology for women and for ecology. Women have got less access to hardware and they earn less so 
their ability to get involved in computers is lower from the start. And most of the technology is not applied to anything useful. Many male users think women on the 
Internet are bad news." Women were among the first to use the "net". In the late 1970s and early 1980s the system was employed widely by librarians, almost
 exclusively female."<br>

"@cafe...opened last week at 12 St. Marks Place...Eight of the dining tables are rigged with fullly packed desktop computers, and there are plans to bring the 
number up to 40...@cafe even sells subscriptions for full Internet access from the restaurant or home for $25...Some patrons complain that dining with a computer
 is too bizarre, a sign that humanity is truly devolving...Table hopping is de rigeur in @cafe, where few people besides the technically savvy staff seem to know what
 they're doing...The ambiance is decidedly more sedate at the Internet Cafe, at 82 East Third Street, which also just opened. This small library cafe has one main
 terminal, thorugh which notebook owners can plug into the Internet from their tables. It also sells memberships to its own Internet service, bigmagic.com 
and plans to rent laptops and to offer printing, scanning and web-page design...But don't expect dinner--just coffee and muffins."<br>

"At Cybersmith [Cambridge MA], personal computers line the counters and customers can sip cappuccinos while surfing the Internet. Those who prefer to sit at 
booths have a sleection of specialties to choose from, like 'Internet Access' and 'CD-ROM and Multimedia.' And customers--from 7 to 70 years old--can sit and 
experiment, with a staff of 'technosmiths' to help them with any problems. Cybersmith is one of a growing number of low-cost eating places catering to both the 
cyber set and those mystified by but curious about everything cyber...But while most cyber cafes have computer games or a few terminals with access to the
 Internet, Cybersmith offers a range of the latest in interactive technology, incoudihng online serivces, computer games, virtual reality machines as well as computers
 outfitted with video cameras that create images for T-shirts. 'The technology elite is developing thses different media, but the geneeal public has hd no place to go 
catch up...We wanted to offer an unintimidating way to introduce the novice to cutting-edge technology. The care adds a sense of community, something familiar
 that people can approach.' Within Cybersmith's 5,6000-square food space are 53 computers, most of them Apple Macintoshes. A flight simulator is the newest
 addition. Cybersmith has also installed a new communications link that will speed up access to the Internet and online-services for its customers...the cafe's 
intergenerational lure, one that extended beyond the 15-year-old Nintendo jockeys who might be expceted to flock to a place like this. 'We've had lots of older
 folks come in here and say 'Teach me what my grandkids have been telling us.'...Cybersmith...opened in February...A few thousand patronize the cafe each week, 
with the peak hours during the evenings and on weekends."<br>

"Welcome to the cybercafe, the newest addition to the on-line lexicon. New York's first three cybercafes, which opened this spring, charge customers $10 to $14
 an hour to use a computer linked to the Internet. While they eat cake or drink a cappuccino, patrons can send electronic mail, check out a chat line, or at one cafe, 
plug in their own laptop. More than making money, the cafe owners say their goal is to educate a public still intimidated by computers. 'You don't have to be a brain
 surgeon to use the Internet, ' says Dave Williams, co-owner of the Heroic Sandwich cybercafe...The on-line cafes are among about 50 that have opened worldwide 
in the past several years, with at least 25 more in the works...About 20 are in the United States...Manhattan's largest cybercafe, named for the 'AT' symbol on a
 keyboard, offers a full menu with everything from sandwiches to sushi and meat loaf. But it feels like a coffee house, with 15 terminals scattered amid red brick 
walls in a former book shop...The care also offers video conferencing and concerts or poetry readings that are broadcast onto the Internet through tiny cameras and 
microphones atop five computers. Education is the goal at the Internet cafe, which offers Internet training classes, $20 for two hours, plus one hour of computer 
time...The Heroic Sandwich is the smallest local cybercafe, with one pentium pc...owner Dave Williams, says, 'The non-threatening approach is deliberate, and 
designed to attract women.'"<br>

<b>Singapore's CyberNet Cafe</b><br>
"Inside the pre-World War Two shop, a fishing net hangs from the dark wooden ceiling and a surfboard marked "CyberNet Cafe" lies above the food counter. A 
dozen personal computers and colourful magazines beckon as customers walk into the shop, a stone's throw from the harbour. Welcome to Singapore's first 
cybercafe, where patrons can eat, drink and surf the wonders of the Internet. "The cafe idea is for people who do not know much about Internet," said Chan 
Cheng Boon, director of business development and marketing. "If they find this environment comfortable, they can also do their work here." At the cafe, a cup of 
coffee, a croissant and an hour of surfing the Net costs S$13 (US$9.20), while a two-and-a-half hour training session for newcomers is S$49 ($34.50). The fees
 include the use of the cafe's Internet address. Chan said the cafe plans, pending government approval, to allow users to use their own addresses. Opened on 
August 28 and modelled along the lines of London's Cyberia, the world's first cybercafe, the S$200,000 ($140,000) shop was set up by Chan and three other 
young Singaporean businessmen who met while studying in Britain."<br>

<b>[1996: global connection becomes big business]</b><br>
"A cybercafe looks like a collision between delivery trucks from Radio Shack and Au Bon Pain. It rents online time to customers while serving them food and
 beverages. Cafe-goers explore cyberspace while leisurely sipping on tea or latte, perhaps waiting for a friend to pop in. Not everyone sees the logic. 'It strikes me 
as anthithetical to the notion of a coffeehouse,' said Clifford Stoll, author of <i>Silicon Snake Oil: Second Thoughts on the Information Highway</i>.  'Guys will sit there 
working online, ignoring their companions, not even speaking to them."...Even from a business point of view, one local tavern and restaurant owner shies away from
 them...But others think the critics are missing the point. 'The celebrity of the Internet would break down some of the barriers of people talking to each other.'...
Locally so far, it's tough to tell. Blue Mountain Coffee & Tea in Northwest Washington was the first place to offer a computer for its customers. But it was only 
one machine, and that was not hooked up to most Internet services, and the whole thing fell into disuse for a while when a customer spilled coffee on the machine, 
frying it. A cybercafe opened in the Shenandoah Valle in Staunton, Va., last month, but for most Washingtonians, that's a long drive for and e-mail and a croissant...
The OnLine Cafe [Rockville Pike MD] being created by Brian A. Colella...will be the metropolitan area's first eatery using a group of computers as its central 
attraction...Early this month...began charging $10 an hour for online time...It will be a while before anyone can judge whether the Washington entry will be as 
intriguing as the wired dens that have opened over the past two years in San Francisco, London and New York....Mark Dziecielewski, a Briton who is the leading

<b>@Internet recipes, webs, blogs &c.</b><br>
Traditional media protocol is driven by industry standards, economic realities & popular demand. The Internet pushes this relationship
 to the max. Anyway you look at it, the possibilities are endless.
<p>
<b>First recipe on the Internet?</b><br>
The "Web" as we know it today, was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990. The Internet existed in various forms from the 
1950s forward. This system was a byproduct of the Cold War. Original users were government officials, think tanks, 
research scientists, military intelligence personnel and computer analysts/engineers. The first recipe shared on the 
Internet is not recorded. It was probably a family favorite of a high level official with top-level security clearance and some downtime. 
Electronic bulletin boards and usenet newsgroups were the forerunners of today's social media. Moderated or open, these 
groups arranged themselves by topic. rec.food.recipes (1985?) was one of the earliest dedicated online recipe exchanges. Our 
research indicates the first Web sites devoted to food surface in the mid 1990s. <a href="internet.html#globalgourmet">Global Gourmet</a>, launched September 1,
 1994, claims to be the first. We find no evidence refuting that. <a href="internet.html#allrecipes">Allrecipes.com</a> launched in 1995.

<b>CD-ROM cookbooks</b><br>
"Welcome to the world of CD-ROM cooking disks. When plugged into personal computers, these compact disks can present reams of informaiton complete 
with videos and music. They are the latest effort to take recipes out of cookbooks and put them into the modern language of multimedia 
communications. Cooking videos, the previous effort, were a flop. Not many kitchens are equipped with VCR's and there has been no rush to put 
computers in the kitchen, either. For now, the printed page has nothing to worry about. But what does the future hold? 
CD-ROM's...take the idea of the cooking video a step further. The screen of a computer with CD-ROM capabilities and speakers can not 
ony display written recipes but also provide oral directions while visually showing how to truss a chicken; it can provide a menu for serving the 
chicken and a print out of a shopping list for the meal, all of this with background music. One disk can hold the contents of hundreds of 
cookbooks without photos or videos, or the recipes of a large cookbook complete with photographs and video...A foray into the world of 
electronic cooking has produced only seven CD-ROM's that work with I.B.M.-compatible computers. A couple of others are for the 
Apple Macintosh only...Robin Leach...has turned 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous' into a CD-ROM cookbook. The others span the 
spectrum of cooking styles, from a disk with more than a million recipes, where Velveeta and canned mushroom soup run rampant, to 
'The New Basics Electronic Cookbook,' a CD-ROM version of the cookbook from the 'Silver Palate' due, Sheila Lukens and Julee 
Rosso. These are a taste of what may lie ahead...Among the information exchanges on the Internet are electronic bulletin 
boards for people interested in foods in which users post questions...and ask for recipes...The cooking disk that cones within hailing 
distance of its potential os the Better Homes and Gardens Healthy Cooking CD Cookbook. It searches, it scales recips up and down, it

properly to how to cook eggs safely. Computer junkies and nutrition professionals are sharing all kinds of information on the

<b>The Global Gourmet</b><br>
"The Global Gourmet Web site, "the Web's first food and cooking e-zine," was created in 1994 and is filled with cookbook reviews, recipes and articles about food. 
Executive Editor Kate Heyhoe is a well-known chef and cookbook author. One section, "Kate's Global Kitchen," currently features an article on making 
home-and-tummy-warming soups, including recipes for Bourbon Corn Chowder and a Chilean chicken-and-vegetable soup called "Cazuela de Elsa." Heyhoe 
weaves her energy agenda nicely into the piece, suggesting that "with fossil fuel costs ramping up so steeply, the costs of installing and using solar-voltaic, 
wind power, ground-source heat pumps, solar films and renewable energy devices are starting to be mighty competitive." "Global Destinations" has informative 
country profiles and recipes from around the world. One is advised that, "[a] vegetarian in Argentina is like a duck out of water," with Argentina being "second only 
to the U.S. as the largest consumer of beef in the world." Also learn to make Finnish Cabbage Rolls (or Kaalikaaryleet), Maraqat al-Safarjal (a Tunisian lamb and 
quince ragout made with dried rose petals) and Polish "Fire Vodka" (Krupnik).

<b>First printed Internet food site guide</b><br>
Gary Holleman's book <i>Food and Wine Online</i> [Van Nostrand Reinhold:New York] was heralded as the first catalog of the culinary Web. When the 
Internet was new to average Americans, books listing topical web sites (patterned on phone book yellow pages) were 
cutting edge. Mr. Holleman states "The International Association of Women Chefs and Restauranteurs (IAWCR) is the 
first culinary association to homestead in cyberspace (p. 9).<br>

"[Tor Manders] collects recipes with a computer...the Oakton software specialist relies almost exclusively on dishes posted on the Internet. He 
owns only a few cookbooks. Collecting recipes via computer is 'more immediate' than using a cookbook...[Manders] computer collection 
goes back 10 years. 'I just click and save them.' It's also far less limiting than a cookbook in which a cook gets one author's version 
of, say meatloaf. On the Internet, a simple request for meatloaf may turn up 50 or more recipes---and from users all over the world... 
Every day, Manders scans the Internet's rec.food.recipes news group...The news group functions like a combination recipe swap/ 
international chain letter..." <br>

<b>Conde Nast media group launches Epicurious</b><br>
Conde Nast's Epicurious (<i>Gourmet</i> & <i>Bon Appetit</i>)launched September 1995. This Internet site
 appears to be the first online counterpart 
to print magazines totally devoted to food & drink. 
<p>
"Newhouse, which counts magazine content heavyweights like the <i>New Yorker</i> among its holdings, so far has just one 
online venture on tap. According to Folio: First Day (Newhouse won't comment), the company's Conde Nast segment is 
developing the cuisine-centric Epicurious online service, which will incorporate content from its Gourmet and Bon 
Appetit titles."
<br>---"Finding your way with fellow publishers . . .Newhouse, K-R to join forces on 'Net," <i>NewsInc.</i>(newswire) February 20, 1995 
<p>
"Even cautious publishers like Conde Nast Publications and Hearst Magazines are finally jumping into cyberspace, joining
 pioneers such as Newsweek, Time Inc., Rodale Press and Hachette Filipacchi Magazines. Conde Nast is believed to be 
developing two online products, including Epicurious, a service based on its Bon Appetit and Gourmet. Hearst in January 
opened the Multimedia Newsstand, a magazine subscription service on the Internet's World Wide Web 
(http://mmnewsstand.com)."<br>
---"Pacesetting Magazines are Shifting Strategies for the Second Phase," Keith J. Kelly, <i>Advertising Age</i>, March 13, 1995 (p. S22) 
<p>
"With much of the magazine industry still ambivalent about the merits of going on line, Conde Nast has decided to bite the 
bullet. The company will announce today the creation of CondeNet, a subsidiary that will develop material for the World
 Wide Web, the part of the Internet that is fast becoming the site of choice for magazines that want to be on line. 
Though Conde Nast hopes that eventually all its 14 core magazines will develop material for the Web, the magazines 
themselves will not be replicated. Instead, information and photographs from archives, reports from Conde Nast's 
worldwide network of stringers and some material from the magazines will be reconfigured to better meet on-line needs.
 For instance, the first magazine scheduled to go on line will be Conde Nast Traveler, sometime in June...Later this 
summer, CondeNet will start Epicurious, which will draw on the resources of <i>Gourmet</i> and <i>Bon Appetit</i> to provide 
information on food, wine, cooking and dining out. The editor in chief, Joan Feeney, former executive editor of 
Mademoiselle, said that Epicurious would offer a menu du jour, complete with directions for buying the food and 
cooking it. Someday, viewers should be able to call up the names of restaurants in cities they are about to visit, get 
copies of menus and even place orders."<br>

"Patti Greaney, a no-nonsense maker of television commercials whose work bounced her from coast to coast, seldom had much time to 
cook for herself. But whenever she found a fee moment to pull out the old pots and pans, her expectations of what she might whip up soared far 
beyond the recipes she had at hand...So Mrs. Greaney sought expert guidance. But, she said, she soon found cookbooks were too 
boring, family recipes too mundane, and the world's greatest chefs were, well, generally about as approachable as divas at 
curtain time. In a flash of inventiveness...she merged her hunger to prepare fine foods with their mastery of producing punchy 
nuggets of advertising copy. Two months ago, with the help of partners, she steaked her claim on the Internet with Starchefs, a 
computer-generated open door into the lives of some of the most acclaimed chefs. Starchefs is one of the most entertaining and 
easiest to use of the emerging culinary sites online. And it seems that cyberspace, that impossibly crowded computer web of 
information, is rapidly developing a sense of taste...Gary Holleman...author of 'Food and Wine Online'...said that as an indication of 
the popularity of food sites, when he searched the Internet for sites containing the word culinary late last year, he turned up 
nothing. When he repeated the search a couple of months ago, more than 800 sites popped up. As a consequence, even the most 
casual Net cruisers can visit fine restaurants, chat with master chefs, swap favorite recipes, browse vineyards and shop the culinary 
markets of the world with full-color sights and, in come instances, engaging sounds." <br>

"Fifteen years ago, a group of five cookie-loving anthropology graduate students launched CookieRecipe.com—one of the web’s first social media 
sites, with all of its contents created by its community. A few years and a few dozen websites (CakeRecipe.com, BreadRecipe.com, 
ChickenRecipe.com, etc.) later, the sites were rolled up into one—Allrecipes.com. As use of the Internet grew among busy, family-focused women, 
Allrecipes grew as well. Today, the site that started with a single cookie recipe has grown to become the world’s largest digital food brand, with 17 
sites and 9 apps serving 25 million cooks in 22 countries. Much has changed in the world since Allrecipes first launched in 1997. In honor of its 15th 
anniversary, Allrecipes reran its first on-site survey from 1999 to capture a snapshot of these changes. Measuring attitudes and behaviors related 
to online recipe websites, Allrecipes discovered the impact digital food resources have had on the shopping and cooking behaviors of home cooks 
over the past 15 years."<br>
