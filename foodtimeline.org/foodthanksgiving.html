"At the end of the [growing] season there is another meeting...This is the season when the corn is ready to store away and thanks must again
be given for food. This ceremony is called...(gathering corn bread). Nearly every family prepares for this by baking a batch of old-fashoined
corn bread. This is brought to the longhouse. A speaker is again appointed and addresses the people, congratulating them on the
succes of their crop or harvest. Thanks are also given to the Great Spirit that the people have been well supplied."<br>

<b>[1621]</b><br>
"Our modern holiday fare bears little resemblance to the food eaten at the three-day 1621 harvest celebration at Plymouth Colony, the event now recalled as the
 “First Thanksgiving.” 
The Wampanoag and Plymouth colonists often ate wild turkey, however it was not specifically mentioned in connection with that 1621 harvest celebration. Edward 
Winslow said only that four men went hunting and brought back large amounts of “fowl” – more likely from the scenario to be seasonal waterfowl such as ducks
 and geese. And what about the stuffing? Yes, the Wampanoag and English did occasionally stuff the birds and fish, typically with herbs, onions or oats (English
 only).
If cranberries were served at the harvest celebration, they appeared in Wampanoag dishes, or possibly to add tartness to an English sauce. It would be 50 years 
before an Englishman mentioned boiling this New England berry with sugar for a “Sauce to eat with …Meat.” In 1621 England, sugar was expensive; in 1621 New
 Plymouth, there may not have been any of this imported spice at all.
Potatoes, which had originated in South America, had not yet made their way into the diet of the Wampanoag in 1621 (though the Wampanoag did eat other local 
varieties of tubers). By 1621, potatoes, both sweet and white, had traveled across the Atlantic to Europe but they had not been generally adopted into the English 
diet. The sweet potato, originating in the Caribbean, was cultivated in Spain and imported into England. It was a rare dainty available to the wealthy, who believed it 
to be a potent aphrodisiac. The white potato was virtually unknown by the average early 17th-century Englishman. Only a few gentlemen botanists and gardeners
 were trying to grow this colonial oddity.
But surely there was pumpkin pie to celebrate the harvest? Pumpkin -- probably yes, but pie – probably not...The typical menu of Thanksgiving dinner is actually more than 200 years younger than that 1621 celebration and reflects both the holiday’s New England roots and a Victorian nostalgia for an imaginary time when hearth and home, family and community, were valued over progress and change. But while we have been able to work out which modern dishes were not available in 1621, just what was served is a tougher nut to crack. The only contemporary description of the event by Edward Winslow tells us that they had seasonal wild fowl and the venison brought by the Wampanoag and presented to key Englishmen. The same writer is eloquent about the bounty of his new home (items in bold were available in the early autumn).
Our bay is full of lobsters all the summer and affordeth variety of other fish; in September we can take a hogshead of eels in a night, with small labor, and can dig them out of their beds all the winter. We have mussels ... at our doors. Oysters we have none near, but we can have them brought by the Indians when we will; all the spring-time the earth sendeth forth naturally very good sallet herbs. Here are grapes, white and red, and very sweet and strong also. Strawberries, gooseberries, raspas, etc. Plums of tree sorts, with black and red, being almost as good as a damson; abundance of roses, white, red, and damask; single, but very sweet indeed… These things I thought good to let you understand, being the truth of things as near as I could experimentally take knowledge of, and that you might on our behalf give God thanks who hath dealt so favorably with us.1
Another source describing the colonial diet that autumn said “besides waterfowl, there was great store of wild turkeys, of which they took many, besides venison, etc. Besides they had … since harvest, Indian corn.”2 
Though not specifically mentioned as a food on the menu, corn was certainly part of the feasts. Remember that the harvest being celebrated was that of the colorful hard flint corn that the English often referred to as Indian corn. This corn was a staple for the Wampanoag and soon became a fixture in the cooking pots of New Plymouth. The English had acquired their first seed corn by helping themselves to a cache of corn from a Native storage pit on one of their initial explorations of Cape Cod. (They later paid the owners for this “borrowed” corn.) It is intriguing to imagine how the English colonists processed and prepared the novel corn for the first time in the fall of 1621. One colonist gave a hint of how his countrymen sought to describe and prepare a new grain in familiar, comforting terms: “Our Indian corn, even the coarsest, maketh as pleasant a meat as rice.”3 In other words, traditional English dishes of porridge and pancakes (and later bread) were adapted to be used with native corn. 
...In September and October, a variety of both dried and fresh vegetables were available. The produce from the gardens of New Plymouth is likely to have included
 what were then called “herbs:” parsnips, collards, carrots, parsley, turnips, spinach, cabbages, sage, thyme, marjoram and onions. Dried cultivated beans and dried
 wild blueberries may have been available as well as native cranberries, pumpkins, grapes and nuts. While many elements of the modern holiday menu are very 
different from the foods eaten in 1621, the bounty of the New England autumn was clearly the basis for both."<br>

<b>[1779]</b><br>
"This menu for a New England Thanksgiving dinner is taken from a letter written in 1779 by Juliana Smith to her 'Dear Cousing Betsey.'
<p><center>
Haunch of Venison   Roast Chine of Pork<br>
Roast Turkey   Pigeon Pasties   Roast Goose<br>
Onions in Cream   Cauliflower   Squash<br>
Potatoes   Raw Celery<br>
Mincemeat Pie   Pumpkin Pie   Apple Pie<br>
Indian Pudding   Plum Pudding<br>
Cider
</center><br>
While it would be difficult to set forth a single 'traditional' Thanksgiving menu, the preparations related by Juliana Smith that went
into this dinner were certainly typical of early New England Thanksgivings. 'This year it was Uncle Simeon's turn to have the dinner at 
his house, but of course we all helped them as they help us when it is their turn, & there is always enough for us all to do. All
the baking of pies & cakes was done at our house & we had the big oven heated & filled twice each day for three days before
it was all done & <i>everything was</i> GOOD, though we did have to do without some things that ought to be used. Neither Love nor (paper)
Money could buy Raisins, but our good red cherries dried without the pits, did almost as well & happily Uncle Simeon still had some 
spices in store. The tables were set in the Dining Hall and even that big room had no space to spare when we were all seated.' 
Apparently roast beef was part of the tradition menu for this family, but 'of course we could have no Roast Beef. None of us have tasted
Beef this three years back as it must all go to the Army, & too little they get, poor fellows. But, Nayquittymaw's Hunters were able
to get us a fine red Deer, so that we had a good haunch of Venisson on each Table.' There was an abundance of vegetables on 
the table...Cider was served instead of wine, wiht the explanation that Uncle Simeon was saving his cask 'for the sick.' Juliana
added that 'The Pumpkin Pies, Apple Tarts & big Indian Puddings lacked for nothing save <i>Appetite</i> by the time we had
got round to them...We did not rise from the Table until it was quite dark, & then when the dishes had been cleared away we all
got round the fire as close as we could, & cracked nuts, & sang songs & told stories."<br>

"Thanksgiving</b>...'Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home.' And he is no true Yankee, who is not, in heart, at least, at home on Thanksgiving day...Another 
old saying, of the truth of which is expected every New Englander will on this day give practical demonstration, is theat "Victuals always taste best at home." It is a 
day of universal stuffing--and it is absolutely requisite to a proper observance of Thanksgiving, that at least three dinners should be eaten up in one. The children and
 grandhildren return home at this season, to pay their respects and manifest their undiminished love and affection, not to the "old folks" alone, but also to their 
roasted turkies and pumpkin pies...As a matter of course, Thanksgiving week is the harvest time of the merchants, especially those who deal in butter, lard, eggs,
 raisins and spices. The markets are supplied with poultry of all kinds...Thanksgiving week, moreover, is the crisis of a turkey's life...The dinner is the all important
 item...turkeys, geese, and chickens...stuffed and roasted for the occasion...Then come puddings and pies...among the most prominent of which is that savory dish,
 peculiar to New England--that sine qua non of a Thanksgiving dinner--the well filled, deep and spacious pumpkin pie. This concludes the feast--and for the

"Thanksgiving day has come--let us make the most of it. It has a threefold nature...Spend it simply as a day of religious 
exercises and it would answer a good turn for men in this irreligious age. Spend it as a day of feasting simply, and one may have 
a very pleasant recollection of it during the coming year, and perhaps see nothing to regret on it s recurrence to  memory. Or give
it over entirely to the deeds of charity and works of benevolence, and one may make a good friend of conscience and lay fat  streaks of comfort upon the ribs of his experience. Each is good, but the style which most fully meets our ideal of a 
Thanksgiving is where the three ways are twisted together into one...After service should come a dinner; --one so differnt from 
the daily dinner as to be a notability among the dinners of hte year;---a thing to be though of with a watering at the mouth;--one that
a body may reproduce in his dreams when half-starved. It is all nonsense to say that a good inner is a transient affair; that its
virtue, like the savor of a roasting goose, is unsubstantial and of no account but for a moment...A right nice dinner, under
right pleasant circumstances, is like a thing of beauty--a joy forever. We feel warmer on a chill November night for the remembrance
of a roasting fire the night before. A chill passes over us whne we think of the cold stoveless churches that they used to pack
us in and preach us at by the hour. Our sorrows are represented in their memory, and the ghosts of our good dinners come up to 
comfort us years after the flesh they laid upon our homes has been wasted by toil, and those who eat them with us have ceased from
the earth. Hard as the time are, no money that is not of fabulous amount could buy of us the bare memory of some Thanksgiving dinners
we have eaten before now with the old folks at home.  Let those who can, then, have a good dinner on Thanksgiving day...Blessed charity 
is not to be omitted...Let all unwelcome tasks be postponed to the next work day. Let the punishments lie over until Friday. Make it 
a day to be remembered, without any alloy, so far as it is possible...So may this Thanksgiving be a hearty and happy one, and one
but pleasant days meet you till the return of another."<br>

ago embarked on the Mayflower, seeking a land where they could enjoy freedom for themselves and their children. A public
Thanksgiving dinner was preparerd at Lawrence, the proceeds of the tickets to be applied for the benefit of the Free-Sate prisoners
at Lecompoton...The table was spread in a large stone building erected for a store, directly opposite the ruins of the

day of November there shall be no soldiers in the Army of the Potaomac the James or the Shenandoah, and no sailor in the

to send our more Southern posts. To enable us to carry out our own undertaking, we need the active cooperation of all loyal
people in the North and East, and to them we confindently appeal. We ask primarily for donations of cooked poultry and other proper
meats, as well as for mince pies and for fruit. If any person is so situated as to be unable to cook the poultry or meat, we will
receive it uncooked. To those who are unable to send donations in kind, we appeal for generous contributions in money. Will not every
wife who has a husband, brother, serving in the armies or navies of the Union, feel that this appeal is to her personally, and
do her part to enable us to accomplish our undertaking?...We will undertake to send to the fort all donations in kind that may reach
us on or before Nov. 20, and to see that they are properly and equally distributed. The should be wrapped in white paper boxes, and 
addressed to Geo. W. Bluff, Getty's Buiding, Trinity Place, New York. If uncooked it should be so marked on the outside of the 
box, and a list of contents should accompany the mix. Poultry, properly cooked, will keep ten days. None should be sent which
has been cooked prior to Nov. 14. Uncooked poultry or meat should reach us on or before Nov. 18, that it may be cooked here."<br>

"Our Thanksiving-dinner table is not furnished as our grandmothers loaded their in the olden time. The board no longer groans, either 
literally or metaphorically, under its burden of meats, vegetables, and sweets...Begin the meal with a good soup. Either oyster or
tomato is recommended. To this should succeed fish. If you live near the seashore, boiled cod with drawn butter may be suggested; if 
you are in one of the interior States, lake trout or whitefush with egg sauce will be found equally good for the occasion. Most
well-bred people, I may ht just here, in eating fish--boild, in particular--rarely touch it with their knives, even when there are of
silver. The fork is used for breakgin apart the flakes, for separating form these and removing the bones, and for conveying the
prepared morsel to the mouth. No vegetables, unless it be potatoes, plain or mashed, are passed with fish. Then, leading up to the main
business of the hour, let the next offering be nice entree of made-dish--chicken-pates or croquettes, in memoriam of the ponderous
chicken-pie which was a standing dish with our grandmothers on the fourth Thursday of November. With these send around stewed
salsify and pickles. Then--the central theme, the point of clustering interests--the Thanksgiving turkey! He should be well 
stuffed, carefully basted, judiciously turned from time to time, rich in coloring, done to a turn in the thickest joint, but nowhere
scorched--a goodly type of plenty from temporary seclusion. Our bird should be dished on a large platter and accompanied by a sauce-boat
of gravy from which the fat was skimmed before the chopped giblets were stirred in; also a dish of cranberry-sauce, or 
jelly, and sweet potatoes. When the savory portion laid on each plate and has been duly discussed, pass a glass stqand or salver or crisp
celery, both as an assistant to the gastric juices and as a tonic to the palate that shall prepare if for the remainder of the
banquet...Eat the lettuce--and, indeed, all salads--with the fork alone. If the leaves have been properly selected, there is
no excuse for touching the knife; and lettuc which cannot be cut with a fork-tine is unfit for table use. Crackers and cheese
follow this course, and if you like, olives. This is the breagint-space in a 'course dinner,' and is the cheerful chat that has been the best sauce
of the meal is here especially in order--a runnign fire of jest and repartee, reactign wholesomely upon the appetite and
digestion. The pumpkin-pie is the next consideration. The crust should be short and flaky, not friable and tasting like
dessicated lard. The filling must be of a golden brown, in the enjoyment of which the palate cannot discern the various elements of
milk, sugar, eggs, and pumpkin, but is well pleased with the combined whole. Fruit and nuts are eaten at eas; and, these
disposed of, send black coffee after the withdrawing company into the parlor as a grateful stomachic sequel. The dinner here
proposed costs no more than the very promiscuouis 'spread' that crowds many a table in farmhouse and unfashionable street upon this
national anniversary, to be swallowed in half the time the decorous suggestions above will require."<br>

"During the week preceding Thanksgiving the New England housekeeper is a busy woman. All over the country, but especially in 
New England, men and women look forward to the holiday as a time for going to old homes,--a family day. At no other time in 
the year do so many large family-gatherings take place. It is desirable to preserve the characteristics of the old-fashioned
dinner, yet the addition of comparatively modern dishes improves the meal...Remember that the chief aim is to produce
happiness, and that many of the company will not be wholly happy if the mistress of the household must pass a good part of
the day in the kitchen. On this account the greater the preparations made in advance the better, so as to relieve the housekeeper
of as many duties and as much anxiety as possible of the holiday."<br>

"This, of all days in the year, is the one to lift you from the burdens of care and trials. It is a day of happiness, because as a 
rule it brings a family reunions; and to the American, home happiness is as essential to his existence as pure air. This day
should also be a day of happiness, as it is a day of thanksgiving, and every creature, no matter what his position chances to be,
has, if he looks at it in the proper light, something to be thankful for. One day, among the many days, put aside as a thanksgiving to 
Him, the Giver of all good to all men, makes it more impressive than each day's thanksgiving. The dinner should be as good as one can
afford. Thought and management will give a change to those whose purses be thin, and, with a proper feeling and happiness, this dinner, 
with but slight variations, will be the best dinner of all the year. To eat and enjoy the good that God has given us is one way of
showing to him our appreciation of them. Milton says: 'To refrain, when bounty has been given us, is an evidence of ingratitutde
to the Giver.' Come, if possible, this day to the table with a light heart and a cheerful manner, and do your part to make the feast
a happy one. A turkey must, of course, be an important feature of this our thanksgiving dinner, and a New Englander would tell
you that a baked ham was also a necessity. I shall give three bills of fare, with quantities for twelve person.

"Thanksgiving Dinner. <br>
Like Christmas, Thanskgiving has its own bill of fare which has not been varied for many
generations. Roasted turkey, pumpkin, mince and apple custard pies are served in almost all parts
of the United States. A heavy breakfast, with chicken pie, and a late dinner are common rules. If
shell-fish are in good condition, serve oysters on the half-shell or oyster cocktails as first course; if
not, serve a clear soup. The turkey may be stuffed with oysters, or oyster sauce may be used in
place of giblet sauce, or scalloped oysters may be served as a side dish. Oysters seem to be a part
of the Thanksgiving dinner. Pumpkins, corn, nuts, fruits and bitter-sweet are the choice
decorations.<br><center>

<b>[1905]</b><br>
"In no place as in New England, or where New England's sons and daughters sojourn, does the Thanksgiving season seem complete; and 
no sort of homely feasting ever attains the absolute comfort of an old-fashioned New England Thanksgiving Day dinner. The many
scattered children of that rocky soil from which their forefathers wrung scant living will welcome this recall of the old-time 
festivity, even if they cannot perfectly reproduce it. There is a distinction without much difference in the dinners at the coast
and in the interior; on farms and in villages away from the railroads fresh fish is seldom used, while on the coast baked
tautog is a prime Thanksgiving luxury; oysters reach the interior both in cans and in the shells, and are regarded as special
rarities worthy to be served at the greatest festivals; then, too, away from the large towns game birds are rarely cooked, partridge
being the exception...Even the interior dinners might be varied with game, for the addition of the partridge there are plenty
of woodock, wild duck, and herons, to say nothing of the Gargantuan widow's cruse full of young rooks for pies. A typical 
dinner near the New England coast would be somewhat as follows:<p>
Baked Tautog, Boiled chicken with oyster sauce, Potatoes, Beets, Onions, Mashed turnips and squash, Sweet potatoes, Beef a la mode, 
Roast turkey with cranberry jelly, Roast venison with currant jelly, Assorted pickles, Roast or baked partridge or wild duck,
Celery, Plum-pudding, Various cakes, Apple, mince, squash, pumpkin, and custard pies, Cider, Nuts, Apples, Raisins, Coffee...
<p>
"Much sarcasm is called forth by the New England cusom of using such food to excess, but it does not seem so very absurd to
those "to the manner born."...It seems also that the company dinners of the interior are more profuse in quantity and variety than
those of the towns; all the good things in the form of preserves, jellies, and pickles (sour and sweet), and all the favorite
pies and puddings are made, except perhaps plum-pudding, which some researve solely for the Christmas dinner; but generally throughout
New Engalnd more attention is given to Thanksgiving than to Christmas--the lingering trace of the old Puritans' and 
Covenanters' protest against the observance of the highest festival of the Established Church. The next bill of fare may seem 
exaggerated, but the reader must remember that many of the Thanksgivings in the interior, especially upon large farms, are
family gatherings to which the children  of several generations come, and all traditions of mother's and grandmother's 
culinary skill must be sustained; every homely dainty is called out from the shadows of the pantry and spring-house, and the embers
revived in the old brick oven and under the back-log in fireplaces where the modern cooking stove burns all the rest of the
year. If the feast seems heroic, so too are the appetites of the guests, tempered to meet the exencies of the exceptional
occaision...The bill of fare then will be:
<p>
"Fried oysters, or oyster stew, Baked chicken pie, Sweet and our pickles and catsup, Mashed potatoes and turnips, Boiled while potatoes,
Boiled onions, Baked beets, Squash, Roast spareribs with stuffing and apple-sauce, Roast turkey, goose, or chicken with cranberry-sauce, 
Fried sausage with fried apples, Baked Indian pudding, Steamed fruit or cracker pudding, Mince, apple, squash, pumpkin, and 
berry pies with cheese, Doughnuts, crullers, cookies, cup cakes, and gold-and-silver, marble, and sponge cakes, Washington
pie, Various preserves, Cider, Home-made wines and shrub."<br>

"Menu-Thanksgiving Day...A peanut doll dressed in blue and white crepe paper in Puritan costume, holding a few heads of 
wheat, makes an appropriate and dainty Thanksgiving favor. Decorate the table with autumn leaves. Corn, husked and tied together, is
most effective, suspended here and there from the walls and between the doors. As Thanksgiving is the one day of the year when 
all America gives praise for prosperity and freedom, an unusually well-filled board is not only in good taste, but is 
expected. To make a unique Thanksgiving dessert, cut a small pumpkin across the top. Carefully scoop out the inside. Place on a 
dish and fill with Floating Island; replace the pumpkin top. Garnish the platter with generous sprigs of autumn leaves, and on these
lay a variety of sliced cakes.<p>
