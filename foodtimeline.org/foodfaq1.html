<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Charlotte, Charlotte Russe & Charley Roosh</b></font><br>
According to the food historians, charlottes were *invented* in England the last part of the 18th
century. Cooked charlottes are related to ancient <a href="foodpuddings.html#bread">bread
pudding</a>; uncooked charlottes are related to <a href="foodfaq1.html#englishtrifle">Elizabethan trifles</a>.
Charlotte is said to be named for Queen Charlotte, wife of George III. Fancy, molded desserts
remained popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries. We find mid-19th century recipes for apple,
apricot and pear charlottes. <a href="foodfaq1.html#charlotterusse">Charlotte Russe</a>, a similar confection composed of cream instead of
fruit, is attributed by some to Careme. Early 19th century Europe was intrigued by everything Russian. 
Think: <a href="restaurants.html#russianservice">
Service a la Russe</a>. These confections ultimately inspired Brooklyn's 
legendary childhood bakery staple: <a href="foodfaq1.html#charleyroosh">Charley Roosh</a>. Considered by some to be the ultimate personal portion 
of "push-up-pop" of cakey confectionery deliciousness. Baby boomers growing up in the greater NYC area knew this Charley well.
<p>
<b>What is Charlotte?</b><br>
"A pudding made in a mould with sponge fingers or bread slices. There are two principal kinds:
baked and unbaked. The best-known baked charlotte is Apple charlotte...It seems clear that this
charlotte began life in Britain. The OED [Oxford English Dictionary] gives the earliest relevant
appearance of 'charlotte' in print as 1796, and at least one recipe for Apple charlotte was
published within ten years or so. The name may have been bestowed in honour of Queen
Charlotte (1744-1818), wife of George III, said to be a patron of apple growers...The principal
unbaked charlotte is Charlotte (a la) Russe. Here the mould is lined with sponge fingers. In some
fancy versions, these are omitted from the bottom, which is covered with a decorative
arrangement of glace fruit with a layer of jelly cementing it into a mosaic. The mould is filled up
with a rich cream filling containing gelatin, so that it sets and can be turned out...The history of
this item seems to have begin with the famous French chef Careme, at the beginning of the 19th
century, probably when he was working for the Prince Regent in England, and perhaps after he
had come across the British baked charlotte. In fact he called his invention Charlotte a la
parisienne; it is said to have acquired the name russe at a banquet in honour of Tsar Alexander I,
or because of the switch in France to service a la Russe. Claudine Brecourt-Villars...dates the
appearance of the term charlotte in a French recipe book to 1806..."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
157)
<p>
"The charlotte is a hot pudding consisting of fruit, typically apple, baked within a case of bread,
sponge cake, etc., in a characteristically deep round mould. It first appears on the scene at the end
of the eighteenth century (in a poem called <i>Hasty Pudding</i> by J. Barlow: "The Charlotte
brown, within whose crusty sides a belly soft the pulpy apple hides'), wife of George III, who
apparently was an enthusiastic patron of apple growers. The coincidence of names is probably
fortuitous, but what is certain is that as early as the first decade of the nineteenth century recipes
for the dish had begun to appear; this from M.E. Rundell, <i>A New System of Domestic
Cookery</i> (1807):  Cut as many very thin slices of white bread as will cover the bottom and
line the sides of the baking dish, but first rub it thick with butter. Put apples, in thin slices, into the
dish.'<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2003 (p.
66)
<p>
<b>How were the first Charlottes made?</b><blockquote>
<b>[1807]<br>
"A Charlotte. </b><br>
Cut as many very thin slices of while bread as will cover the bottom and line the sides of a baking dish, but first rub it thick with butter. Put apples, in thin slices, into
 the dish, in layers, till full, strewing sugar between, and bits of butter. In the mean time, soak as many thin slices of bread as will cover the whole, in warm milk, over
 which lay a plate, and, a weight to keep the bread close on the apples. Bake slowly three hours. To a middling-sized dish use half a pound of butter in the
 whole."<br>

"Charlotte.</b><br>
Stew any kind of fruit, and season it in any way you like best; fry some soices of bread in butter,
put them, while hot, in the bottom and round the sides of a dish which has been rubbed with
butter, put in your fruit, and lay slices of bread on the top; bake it a few minutes, turn it carefully
into another dish, sprinkle on some powdered sugar, and glaze it with a salamander."<br>

<b>Charlotte Russe</b><br>
"The apple charlotte has on the whole remained a British dish, but the charlotte has achieved
wider renown in the shape of the charlotte russe, literally  'Russian charlotte', a cold pudding in
which custard replaces the fruit. It was supposedly invented by the French chef Antonin Careme
in 1802, who, so the story goes, initially named it charlotte a la parisienne, but later changed it to
charlotte russe in honour of his employer, Czar Alexander of Russia."<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2003 (p.
66)

"Charlotte russe. A French dessert (supposedly created by Marie-Antonin Careme) made in mold
with ladyfingers and Bavarian cream...While this confection is known and made in the United
States, a simple version consisting of a square of sponge cake topped with whipped cream
(sometimes with chocolate sprinkles) and a maraschino cherry was also called a "charlotte russe,"
a variation of which appeared in Lafcadio Hearn's <i>La Cuisine Creole</i> (1885). This was a
standard item in eastern cities, particularly among urban Jewish Americans (some of whom
pronounce the item "charely roose" or "charlotte roosh"), who made it at home or bought it at a
pastry shop, where it was set on a frilled cardboard holder whose center would be pushed up as to
reveal more cake as the whipped cream was consumed."<br>

York] 1999 (p. 64)

<b>Charley roose/charley roosh, Brooklyn New York</b><br>
"Growing up in Brownsville, Brooklyn, you got a charlotte russe at the corner candy store where
everyone hung out until a certain age. They were seasonal, arrayed in a glass container on the
counter, regarded as a special treat. They were spongecake wrapped with stiff cardboard and
whipped cream on top. There were two kinds of bakeries--bakeries that did their own baking
pastries and cakes and commissioned bakeries that got their stuff from other bakeries...Norman
Podhoretz, editor of <i>Commentary Magazine</i>...Although charlotte russe was by no means
Jewish--it was popular a popular Victorian dessert--it became a winter fixture in city
neighborhoods."<br>
---<i>Jewish Cooking in America</i>, Joan Nathan [Alfred A. Knopf:New York] 1998 (p. 322)
<p>
"The classic French dessert called charlotte russe is an elegant mold of ladyfingers, filled with
flavored Bavarian cream. But to old-time Brooklynites, a charlotte russe was a round of sponge
cake topped with sweetened whipped cream, chocolate sprinkles, and sometimes a marashcino
cherry, surrounded by a frilled cardboard holder with a round of cardboard on the bottom. As the
cream went down, you pushed the cardboard up from the bottom, so you could eat the
cake...these were Brooklyn ambrosia."<br>

York] 1994 (p. 386)[NOTE: this book contains memories and a recipe.]

"The Charlotte Russe, that venerable New York specialty that left generations of city kids with white mustaches on their faces, 
is not extinct but, like ancient Chinese jade, it is hard to come by. The Charlotte Russe was a street delicacy that, as a 
perishable, came out in autumn and disappeared, mostly, when the weather turned hot. Basically, it was a piece of sponge cake topped
by a heap of whipped cream with a cherry at its pinnacle. Sometimes with fruit, sometimes with sprinkles, but these were
optional. It cost a nickel at most and came in a partitioned round white cup with a moveable bottom that you could push up as you
made your way through the whipped cream. You bought it in candy stores, bakeries and sometimes in five-and-dime stores. And it was
always eaten in the street; it was not a dessert but a snack. It has disappeared from the modern candy store, which today is 
either a luncheonette or a dry-goods card shop, but there are still bakeries here and there with a sense of tradition that still
turn out the Charlotte Russe. Out in the Glen Oaks neighborhood of Queens, Murray Beberman sells it in the old-style cups at the 
Garden Bake Shop, 265-03 Union Turnpike. He outs out a couple of dozen every day...it costs 45 cents. The customers are past the 
bloom of youth and their Charlotte Russe is a short trip back to the days when the stomach was strong...for most people the Charlotte
Russe is a mere memory. It was part of growing up in New York. They remember the candy store with the cups lined up in a glass case
fitted with a door that they opened to pick the Charlotte Russe they wanted...Sam Levenson...remembered that it was a 'take out item.'
'You ate it on the street but not where there were kids on bicycles or skates hwo might knock you down...I used to go partners on 
a three-cent Charlotte Russe. And then we would have 32 people ask for a lick. I was a champion, I could lick a Charlotte Russe for
six hours before I hit the sponge cake. I have never had a cherry that tasted as good as the one of a Charlotte Russe. 
Charlotte Russe? Nobody knew to call it that. We all called it a tcharla droos...You couldn't get that at home.'...The Charlotte
Russe seems to have faded after World War II, but the reasons might call for a seminar or a doctoral thesis. Higher labor costs  in
bakeries, more whipped cream available to the masses, a fashion change of the sort that rocks Seventh Avenue. Take your choice. But it 
had an honorable career...the Charlotte Russe, still lip-smacking in memory, has found that the movable bottom has nearly pushed
up to the top of the cup of time. Soon there may be no more."<br>

<blockquote>

<b>[1845]<br>
"A Charlotte a la Parisienne.</b><br>
This dish is sometimes called in England a Vienna cake; and it is known here also, we believe, as a
Gateaux de Bordeax. Cut horizontally into half-inch slices a savoy or sponge cake, and cover each
slice with a different kind of preserve; replace them in their original form, and spread equally over
the cake an icing made with whites of three eggs, and four ounces of the finest pounded sugar; sift
more sugar over it in every part, and put it into a very gentle oven to dry. The eggs should be
whisked to snow before they are used. One kind of preserve, instead of several, can be used for
this dish; and a rice or a pound cake may supply the place of the Savoy or sponge biscuit."<br>

"Charlotte Russe in various ways. </b><br>
There are many varieties of the Charlotte. They are always similarly made, that is with sponge
cake or lady fingers, and whipped cream, custard of blancmange. One way is to beat the whites of
three eggs to a high froth, with a quarter of a pound of sugar, and a half a pint of cream, until it is
quite thick and light; flavor this to your taste with lemon or vanilla, and pour it into a cake-lined
mould; place some of the sliced cake or lady fingers on top of the mould and over the cream; set it
on ice, and when wanted turn it on a dish and serve. Or, having lined a basin or mould, or small
tin cups with any convenient cake, such as lady fingers, sliced savoy cake, or yellow lady cake, fill
them with mock cream, blanc-mange or custard, made from the yolks of eggs; let them become
cold, then turn them out and serve."
<p>
<b>"Plain Charlotte Russe.</b><br>
Boil one ounce of isinglass in a pint of water until reduced one-half. While it is boiling, make a
custard of one-half pint of milk, yolks of four eggs, and one-fourth of a pound of sugar; flavor this
with vanilla or lemon. Take a quart of cream, whip it up to a fine froth, and when the isinglass is
nearly cold, so that it will not curdle wth cream, stir it and the cream into the custard. Beat all
thoroughly and set it on ice. This is a nice, easy way to make this dish, and may be made very
ornamental, if wanted so, by lining a glass dish with lady fingers, and then pouring in the cream
and laying fine fancy sugar-drops on top. If you have no lady finger sponges, you can slice any
light sponge cake, and lay it on the bottom and sides of the glass bowl."<br>

Whenever the word "Charlotte" appears, the presence of whipped cream is implied, together with
sponge cake or lady fingers to form a case or lining. Sometimes the mould is lined with lady
fingers or strips of sponge cake and the centre consists of a Bavarian cream. In this case, the
charlotte may be made several hours before serving. But if it is the ordinary type of Charlotte
Russe the dish cannot stand long unless the whipped cream is stiffened by the addition of a little
gelatine...[recipes provided for Charlotte Russe filling with and without gelatine, as well as
chocolate, grape juice and coffee flavorings]..."Plain Charlotte Russe. Line sherbet cups with

<a name="couscous">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Couscous</b></font><br>
Ancient fare? Not quite. 
<p>
"Couscous is a North African staple as far east a Tripoli, and particularly in Morocco and Algeria,
where the
local name for it is sometimes identical to the word for  food' in general. It is also widely known in
neighbouring African countries from Chad to Senegal and has footholds in
Europe...Syria-Palestine...and
somewhat surprisingly in Brazil, where it is made from maize...Algerian folklore has it that
cousous was
invented by the Djinn. Certainly its early history is obscure, but the evidence does not suggest that
it dates
from remote antiquity.  In the 1940s, H. Peres published in the <i>Bulletin des Etudes Arabs</i>
a
compilation of the earliest literary mentions of couscous then known, and all were from the
fifteenth century
or later. The only citation that even claimed to be earlier was a fourteenth-century anecdote
related in the
seventeenth-century book Nafh al-Tib, which told how the mysterious illness of a North African
visitor to
Damascus was cured by making couscous for him. Since the  forties we have become aware of
thirteenth-
and fourteenth-century Arabic cookery books which contain couscous recipes. But altogether, the
suspicious silence about couscous in sources from before the thirteenth century, coupled with the
evident
Berber origin of the Arabic word kishusu, suggest that couscous arose among the period between
the
eleventh-century collapse of the Zirid Kingdom and the trimumph of the Almohads in the
thirteenth. A
peculiaritiy of the way couscous is descrived in the thirteenth-century cookery books also argues
that it was
a relatively recent invention, if we see in it an explanation for how the unique process of creating
the
couscous granules originated...The simplest explanation for this that kuskusu was originally a
small noodle,
and the peculiar stirring technique a hasty was of making a noodle. Its unique lightness when
steamed, and
perhaps its resistance to staling, would have been discovered later."<br>

"Couscous is a staple food in the Maghrib that requires very little in the way of utensils for its
preparation. It is an ideal food for both nomadic and agricultural peoples. The preparation of
couscous is one that symbolizes "happiness and abundance,"...One of the first written references
to couscous is in the anonymous thirteenth-century Hispano-Muslim cooker book "Kitab al-tabikh
fi al-Maghrib wa'l-Andalus...The fact that the name is given with the Arabic article "al" is a flag to
the linguist that the original couscous perparation probably was not an Arab dish, but a Berber
dish, because the Arabic words siksu, kuskus, and kuski, which all mean "couscous" do not take
the article...very early references to couscous show that either it is not unique to the Maghrib or it
spread with great rapidity to the Mashraq (the eastern Arab world)...Although the word
couscous might derive from the Arabic word kaskasa,  to pound small," it is generally thought to
derive from one of the Berber dialects. It has also been suggested that the word derives from the
Arabic name for the perforated earthenware steamer pot used to steam the couscous, called a
kiskis...while another theory attributes the word couscous to the onomatopoeic--the sound of the
steam rising in the coucousiere, the most unlikely explanation."<br>
---<i>A Mediterranean Feast</i>, Clifford A. Wright [Morrow:New York] 1999 (p. 659-660)
<p>
"The stirring and rolling process by which the couscous granules are formed amounts, it has been
suggested, to a way of preserving grain. Couscous is traditionally made from freshly ground
whole grain, which is much better suited to the purpose than bolted flour, because starch readily
accumulates around the larger and harder particles of bran and germ, much as a pearl forms
around a
grain of sand. The resulting granule is in effect a grain turned inside out, with the part of the flour
that can
deteriorate protected from the air by an envelope of starch. It can thus be kept without spoiling
from months
or years...The wide spread of couscous has been influenced also by economic and aesthetic
reasons...Couscous has continued to spread beyond the S. And E. Mediterranean. At some point
it entered
Sicilian cuisine...Couscous is now a common dish in France and increasingly elsewhere in Europe
and N.
America..."<br>

Most Americans associate cranberries with <a href="foodfaq1.html#cranberryturkey">Thanksgiving turkey</a>. They are often classed as 
"New World" food. Not entirely true. Botanists and linguists confirm several varieties of berries, from different 
parts of the northern temperate regions, have been called "cranberry." Early recipes are challenging to identify
because the cranberrry was also known by host of alternative local names (fenwort, for example). Native North Americans had yet another vocabulary
developed for this fruit. <a href="foodfaq1.html#rawcranberries">Raw cranberries</a> were promoted in the 20th century. 
<a href="foodbreads.html#cranberrybread">Cranberry bread & muffins</a> are still popular today.
<p>
"Cranberries grow in Britain, but in medieval times they went under a variety of names such as marsh-wort, fen-wort, and moss-berry. The
term cranberry did not appear until the late seventeenth century, in America. It was a partial translation of kranberry, literally 
'craneberry,' brought across the Atlantic by German immigrants (the German word is an allusions to the plant's long
beaklike stamens). It was the Germans and Scandinavians, too, who probably popularized the notion of eating cranberries with meat
in the English-speaking world, which led to today's pairing of turkey with cranberry sauce."<br>

"Cranberry...Of the same genus as the blueberry, the cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) is a North American shrub that is
so named because its flower stamens resemble a beak--hence named "crane berry," a name...assigned to it by the early
European settlers in New England. The berries, which grew wild in New England, had long been used by Native Americans for 
pemmican (dried and fat). The early European settlers found cranberries too tart to eat by themselves but made them into
pies, puddings, tarts, relishes, preserves, and cranberry sauce. Perhaps appropriately, it was in Massachusetts that commercial
cranberry production was begun in the 1840s..."<br>

1840 can the trials of cultivation be said to have commenced, and not until 1845 was the fact established that the cranberry could
be utilized as a marketable commodity. Cranberries are now extensively grown at Cape Cod and in New Jersey and Wisconsin. Under favorable

<b>Cranberries in the USA</b><br>
"Cranberry...the most important of the berries bourne by a group of low, scrubby, woody plants of the genus Vaccinium. These
grow on moors and mountainsides, in bogs, and other places with poor and acid soil in most parts of the world, but are best
known in N. Europe and N. America...The generic name for Baccinium is the old Latin name from cranberry, derived from 
vacco (cow) and given because cows like the plant...The origin of the name cranberry is obscure, apart from the dubious
suggestion that cranes eat the berries...The plants to which the name cranberry was originally given are two species which 
occur in Europe as well as in other temperate parts of the world...When the Pilgrim Fathers arrived in N. America they found
a local cranberry, V. macrocarpon, which had berries twice the size of those familiar to Europeans, and an equally good
flavour. American Indians were accustomed to eating these fresh or dried, and adding the dried fruits as an ingredient in
Pemmican (a dried, preserved meat product)...It was no dobut these large American cranberries which, at an early stage
in the evolution of Thanksgiving Day dinner, were made into sauce to accompany the turkey, which became established as its
centrepiece."<br>

""As American as cranberry pie" makes much mores sense than the usual saying. Cranberries, after all, are native to America, and pies
or tarts made from them appear in colonial records as early as 1672. Before the middle of the nineteenth century, when
they began to be shipped to cities and larger towns, cranberries, like most fresh produce, were a local item eaten in the places 
where they grew wild--in parts of New England, New Jersey, Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin."<br>

<b>Raw cranberries</b><br>
Our survey of historic USA newspapers & magazines suggests the practice of adding cranberries (fresh or dried) 
to mixed greens is a recent innovation. Say, 2000+. This coincides with the proliferation of prepacked "gourmet" mixed greens (think: baby arugula and mesclin mix in plastic shell containers) and upscale prepacked salad toppers (toasted seasalt almonds, glazed walnuts, asian mixes, wonton strips). 
Before WWII, Americans generally consumed cranberries in processed form (canned jellies, juice, gelatin). 
Fresh cranberries were sometimes combined with stuffing, relish, or <a href="foodbreads.html#cranberrybread">quick breads</a>, 
generally for winter holidays when the product was fresh. In the 1950s we find articles encouraging homemakers to freeze
 fresh cranberries so they could be used throughout the year. Recipes accompanied these early articles (cranberry muffins,
 cranberry bread, cranberry chutney, cranberry pie, &c.) extolling the virtues of tangy flavor and healthy vitamin C. It 
is not until the 2000s do we find suggestions for using them in salads. Of course, actual practice often predates print 
evidence. Cranberry companies (think: Ocean Spray) most likely published recipes promoting innovative uses for fresh and
 dried products. Our WWII era Ocean Spray cooking booklets promote canned sauce product only. No recipes for using 
fresh/dried cranberries. If there is a historic parallel? Early 20th century USA salads sometimes incorporated raisins and 
grapes for flavor and texture.

"Fresh cranberries may be stored in the refrigerator, just as you bought them, for one month. For longer storage, double-wrap and store in the freezer for 
nine months. Mix chopped cranberries with softened butter for spreading on biscuits, muffins, pancakes or waffles. Or, use cranberry 
butter on broiled fish. Add one tablespoon of chopped cranberries to tuna salad or deviled ham for sandwich fillings. Cook 
cranberries with red cabbage, raisins and wine. Serve with pork or ham. To chop cranberries for relish, process 3 cups at a time in a 
food processor." <br>

<a name="cranberryturkey">
<b>Why do we pair cranberries with Thanksgiving turkey?</b><br>
Food historians tell us the practice of pairing of citrus fruits with fatty meat is thousands of years
old, likely originating in the Middle East. Examples are found in many cultures and cuisines. The
acid in the fruit cuts the fat in the meat, making the dish more enjoyable and digestible. Think:
<a href="foodfaq.html#porkapplesauce">pork & applesauce</a>; goose & cherry sauce, fish & lemon, and
 <a href="foodmeats.html#duckalorange">duck a l'orange</a>. In the case of lean meats such as
modern turkey and chicken, cranberries add flavor to what is generally considered a bland food. Visually?
Cranberries add a splash of vibrant color to a traditional "earth tone" plating.

<a name="curry">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Curry</b></font><br>
The history of curry is two-fold: curried-style foods, the Indian dish composed of spices, meat
and rice AND curry powder, a combination of various spices used to flavor food. In India, the
basic formula for  'curry powder' is called 'garam masala', though Indian cookbooks are
quick to note there are many regional variations to this powder. 
<p>
"Curry. From the tamil word  kari' a term for black pepper, derives the Indo-Anglian curry, which
has come to symbolize Indian food for the westerner. The term originally denoted any spiced dish
that accompanied south Indian food, and was first so referred to, using the term  caril', by
Correra as early as in AD 1502...Later the word cury was greatly widened in usage to include a
liquid broth, a thicker stewed preparation, or even a spiced dry dish, all of which appear in turn in
a south Indian meal, each with its own name."<br>
---<I>A Historical Dictionary of Indian Food</i>, K. T. Achaya [Oxford University Press:Delhi]
1998  (p. 58)
<p>
"Spices are the key to Indian cooking. Masalas vary widely and each is designed for a special
purpose. Garam masla, for example, is a basic blend of dried spices to be used alone or with
other seasonings." <br>
---<i>The Cooking of India</i>, Foods of the World [series], Time/Life (p. 6). 
<p>
"Curry is from the Tamil word "kari", meaning stew. Tamil is one of the most widely spoken
languages of the whole vast Indian subcontinent. An Indian curry is indeed made rather like a
stew. It may be of meat, fish, or vegetables, and herbs and spices are added; they are mixed
together and ground to a powder which itself eventually became known as "curry." Originally
every region and every family had its own secret [curry] formula. At the end of the nineteenth
century, however, ready-prepared curry powder could be found for sale in Indian towns.
Then, so the tale goes, an Englishman named Sharwood was dining with the Maharaja of
Madras, who mentioned to him the shop kept by a famous master maker of curry powder
called Vencatachellum. The Englishman visited it and obtained the secret of Madras curry
powder, a mixture of saffron, tumeric, cumin, Kerala coriander and a selection of Orissa
chillies..."<br>
---<i>History of Food</i>, Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat [Barnes & Noble:New York] 1992  (p.
498-9)
<p>
"Curry, a term adopted into the English language from India...The Tamil word "kari" is the
starting point. It means a spicy sauce, one of the sorts of dressing taken in S. India with rice,
and soupy consistency...The traditional S. Indian kari does not have a fixed set of ingredients,
by a typical mixture was and remains the following, all roasted and ground to a powder: kari
patta (curry leaf), coriander, cumin, and mustard seeds, red and black pepper, fenugreek,
tumeric; and less certainly cinnamon, cloves, cardamom."<br>

1999 (p. 235-6)
<p>
"Curry, a mixture of powdered spices. Some curry powders contain up to 16 different ground
spices. Curry was at one time an epicurean rite of English army circles in India, officers

<a name="dolma">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Dolma</b> (stuffed leaves)</font><br>


According to the food historians, modern stuffed grape leaf recipes descended from ancient
Mediterranean fare. Turkish "dolma" and Greek "thrion" were known to ancient cooks.  The
earliest recipes of this sort were both sweet and savory and used fig leaves. Reference to grape
leaves began to appear around the 1st century AD.
<p>
"Dolmades are stuffed vine leaves (the singular is dolma). The dish is popular all over the eastern
Mediterranean, and particularly in Greece and Turkey. It consists of grapvine leaves blanched
and then wrapped around a filling (typically cooked rice and herbs, and often minced lamb as
well), braised, and usually served cold as part of a mezze, or mixed hors d'oeuvres. The word
dolma itself is of Turkish origin, and is a derivative of the verb dolmak,  fill'; dolmades is the
Greek plural form."<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 111)
<p>
"Dolma. Vegetables stuffed in the E. Mediterranean style. There are two main categories: those
with meat stuffings (usually extended with grain), which are served hot, often with as sauce..."
and those with rice stuffings (often enriched with nuts, raisins, or pulses), which are served cold,
dressed with oil...In Turkey, a distinction may also be made between dolma (  stuffed thing'),
made from a hollowed-out vegetable...and sarma (rolled thing), where the filling is rolled in an
edible leaf, such as the vine leaf or cabbage...The distribution, as well as the name dolma itself,
indicates that this dish belongs to the court cuisine of the Ottoman Empire. Vegetables had been
stuffed before Ottoman times, but only sporadically. For instance, the ancient Greek "thrion" was
a fig leaf stuffed with sweetened cheese..The Ottoman origin is somewhat obscured by the fact
that in some countries stuffed vegetables may be referred to by a native name meaning
"stuffed."..In places as remote as Kuwait and Damascus, instead of mahshi waraq  inab (stuffed
fine leaf) one may say mahshi yabraq (in Kuwait, mahshi brag), which comes from the Turkish
yaprak (leaf)."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 253).
<p>
"Fig leaves, thrion, pickled to reduce their bitterness, were required in a well-stocked larder; they
served notably as wrapping for dishes resembling modern dolmadhes."<br>
---<i>Siren Feasts: A History of Food and Gastronomy in Greece</i>, Andrew Dalby
[Routledge:London] 1996 (p. 79)
<p>
Mr. Dalby presents this ancient fig leaf recipe, attributed to the Greek cook Archestratus
[350BC]:<blockquote>
"In autumn, as the Pleaides go down, you can cook bonito-and you can cook it in any way you
please...But if you want to be told this too...the very best way for you to deal with this fish is to
use fig leaves and fresh oregano (not very much), no cheese, no nonsense. Just wrap it up nicely
in fig leaves fastened above with string, then hide it under hot ashes, keeping a watch on the time
when it will be baked. Don't overcook it."<br>

"Dried figs were particularly popular in Rome, and though Columella [Roman agricultural expert
& author, 1st century AD] considred them to be the winter food of country people, he gives
details of an attractive way of preserving them. He suggests treading them out, them mixing them
with toasted sesame, anise, fennel seed, and cumin and wrapping balls of this mixture in fig
leaves."<br>

"The Arab world was under Ottoman rule for five hundred years, and the Turkish influence is
seen in may preparations, such as stuffed grape leaves. But the stuffing of vegetables has its roots
in the Arab cookery of the early Islamic empire of the Abbasids in Baghdad, possibly learned
from the Persians. Ottoman chefs perfected the stuffing of vegetables, and today nearly
everything that can be stuffed is stuffed. Stuffed grape nad cabbage leaf are probably the most
common and loved of all the stuffed vegetables. Stufed grape leaves are a popular mese or mazza
in Greece, Turkey, and the Arab Levant and are known as dolmades in Greece and dolma in
Turkey. With Arab cooks, the stuffed grape leaf becomes a littel more complex and elaborate. It
can be served at room temperature and is called waraq  inab ni'l-zayt (grape leaves with olive
oil) or it can be served hot and is called waraq  inab (grape leaves)."<br>
---A Mediterranean Feast, Clifford A. Wright [William Morrow:New York] 1999 (p. 322)
<p>
"The use of grape leaves as an ingredient in cooking is limited to Greece, the Balkans, and the
Middle East. The name dolmas is Turkish, which might be a clue not so much of its provenance
but of its travels. Nowhere in Europe and certainly not in any of the vine-growing regions of the
European Mediterranean west of Greece do we find any dish even remotely resembling our
dolmades. Perhaps one reason the dish stopped short in Greece and never spread westward was
because the Ottomans never made it as far as Italy or France. The Ottomans spread the dish we
know as dolmas all over their empire. Guessing the origins of any dish is always a tentative
excercise. In the case of dolmathes, rice-the main ingredient-might be the key. 
<p>
"The ancient Greeks knew of rice. In fact, Theophrastus mentions it in his 300 B.C. work,
Enquiry into Plants, but 18 centuries elapsed before rice became a part of the Greek table. Greeks
began cooking with rice in the 15th and 16th centuries. As for the provenance of the grain itself,
it
is known with relative accuracy that the grain first grew in Persia. And it is in fact there that the
first written mention of a dish similar to dolmades appears, in the diaries of a symposiast at one
of
the banquets of King Khusrow II at the start of the 7th century. There in short is the long and
winding history of one of our favorite foods. We might claim it as our own, as every one of our
neighbors does, but the dolma followed its own fateful path through history and time. It is a dish
that belongs both to everyone and, alas, to no one."<br>

Dormice were considered delicacies by Ancient Roman diners. Like geese for foie gras, dormice were kept in pens and

<b>Dormice on ancient tables</b><br>
"Dormouse, the smallest European mammal that was used as human food in classical times. The Greek authors say little of 
it, but Romans considered it a delicacy." <br>
---<i>Food in the Ancient World From A-Z</i>, Andrew Dalby [Routledge:New York] 2003 (p. 122) 
<p>
"In order to satsify his palate, if not his protein needs, man has favoured at least three smaller mammals. The edible or 'Fat' 
Dormouse (Glis glis) is found wild from Spain through Europe and into south-west Asia. Like the rabbit, it does not seem to have been considered 
worthy of domestication untl Roman times, when its culinary reputation was so high that wealthy Rpmans initiated the construction 
of gliraria in order to secure easy supply of this tasty rodent. These enclosures, in use by the latter part of the second 
century BC, were made to simulate the animal's natural habitat, and the occupants were fattened up on a diet of walnuts, acorns, and 
chestnuts. Such restricted breeding populations of dormice, perhaps with periodic 'weeding out' of defective ones not fully 
suitable for the table, would have been an ideal environment for domestication changes to have take place. In at least come cases, the final 
fattening would appear to have been undertaken in special earthenware pots, which restricted the movement of the rodents. Indeed, 
this may represent the beginning of the indoor 'battery' system today! The preparation of the dormouse for the table could be 
quite elaborate." <br>
---<i>Food in Antiquity: A Survey of the Diet of the Early Peoples</i>, Don Brothwell and Patricia Brothwell [Johns Hopkins Press:Baltimore MD] 
expanded edition, 1998 (p. 48-49) 
<p>
"Dormouse, Myoxus glis, distinguished from other dormice (such as shared tea with the March Hare and the Hatter) by being 
called the fat or edible dormouse. This rodent inhabits much of Southern, Central and Eastern Europe and was appreciated by the Romans in classical times as food. 
They fatted dormice on special diets, then stuffed and baked them. An adult dormouse may measure 18 cm (7")...The modern European 
country with the strongest dormouse tradition is Slovenia. Dormouse hunting has long been customary there, the animal being valued 
for fur as well as for meat." <br>

"Dormouse (glis). In northern Europe the dormouse lives in the wild. In most countries it is a protected species, which means that 
it cannot be caught and eaten. In ancient Rome, too, a sumptuary law...forbade the eating of dormice, but no one paid any 
attention, and the dormouse was often on the menu and, in fact, was bred for the table. The animals were allowed to live free in a 
fenced-off garden. When dormice hibernate, they become thinner, and the Romans wanted to prevent this. During the winter season, they put the 
fattened mice into a large jar equipped with an intestinal spiral rim, a glirarium. The dormouse, partly because of its 
size, remained an expensive delicacy... <blockquote>

Glires: isisio porciono, item pulpis ex omni membro glirum, trito cum pipere, mucleis, lasere, liquamine farcies glires, et sutos in tegula positos mittes in 
furnun aut farsos in clibano coques.

<b>"Mice:</b> stuff the mice with minced pork, mouse meat from all parts of the mouse ground with pepper, pine kernels, laser and 
garum. Sew the mouse up and put on a tile on the stove. Or roast in a portable oven. (Apicius 408)." <br>

<p>
<b>English dormice</b><br>
"Two...food animals beloved by Roman epicures were kept in close captivity. Dormice of the continental Euroepan variety, were 
enclosed and fed upon acorns and chestnuts. Finally they were fitted into tiny earthenware pots to be plied with more nuts until 
they became exceedingly plump. They were eaten at Roman banquets, after being stuffed with a mixture of minced pork and dormouse meat 
and baked in the oven. The evidence for these dormice in Britain is unfortunately very slender, and even in the other provinces the 
taste for them died out at the end of the Roman empire and was never later recovered." <br>
---<i>Food and Drink in Britain From the Stone Age to the 19th Century</i>, C. Anne Wilson [Academy Chicago:Chicago] 1991 
(p. 72) 
<p>
"Dormice, which featured in Roman banquets, were a more exotic taste. Apicius suggests that they should be stuffed with minced 
pork, pine kernels and liquamen. At Trimalchio's feast, according to Petronius, they were served sprinkled with honey and 
poppy seeds. The taste is like that of rabbit but, like the guinea pig eaten in Peru, there is more meat on the bones. Dormice were 
kept in pens and pots and fed on acorns and chestnuts to fatten them, until lack of movement and enforced feeding made them plump. 
The system fooled the dormice into believing they were hibernating, thus encouraging growth. Varo and Pliny give instructions 
for this, and Martial indicated that country visitors might bring them as welcome gifts." <br>

Although ancient Roman cooks were known to fry
sweet dough in oil, food historians generally credit the invention of deep-fried yeast cakes to Northern 
European in Medieval times. Names vary according to country of origin and recipe. Shapes, flavors,
thicknesses and fillings are endless. Generally, doughnut-type foods are consumed for breakfast or as fair food. 
The Christian doughnut season spans from Carnival to Lent. <a href="foodfaq1.html#americandoughnutreferences">American references</a> and <a href="foodfaq1.html#americandoughnutrecipes">recipes</a> surface in the early 19th century.

<b>Why do we Americans call them "doughnuts" or "donuts?"</b><br>
"The word [doughnut] is presumably an allusion to the small, rounded shape of the original
doughnuts; the element -nut is used similarly in gingernut and its now obsolete synonym
spicenut."<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food & Drink</i> John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p.
113)[NOTE: according to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, the word "doughnut" was first printed in 1808. "Donut" is a 
20th century USA phonetic rendering.]
 <p>
"Doughnuts are deep-fried cakes with a long European history and roots in still earlier Middle
Eastern cuisine. They were introduced to America by the Dutch in New Newtherland as
oliekoecken (oil cakes or fried cakes)...The were eaten during the Dutch Christmas season...and
for special occasions throughout the year. Once in the New World, the Dutch replaced their frying
oil with the preferred lard (far more available here), as it produced a tender and greaseless crust.
The other ethnic groups brought their own doughnut variations. The Pennsylvania Dutch and the
Moravians who settled in North Carolina made fastnachts on Shrove Tuesday, and the French
established beignets in New Orleans. Ultimately, the English American cooks adopted them as
well. By 1845 doughtnuts appeared in American Cookbooks as staples, and the weekly Saturday
baking (breads, cakes, and pies) included doughtnut frying. In this same antebellum period, two
changes in technology contributed to a basic alteration of the doughnut. Chemical leavening
(notably baking powder) was substituted for yeast, producing a more cakelike and less breadlike
product. In the same era inexpensive tin doughnut cutters with holes were manufactured
commercially and sold widely."<br>

"These fashionable parties were generally confined to the higher classes, or noblesse: that is to say, such as kept their own cows and drove their own waggons. The company commonly assembled at three o'clock, and went away about six, unless it was in winter time, when the fashionable hours were a little earlier, that the ladies might get home before dark. The tea-table was crowned with a huge earthen dish, well stored with slices of fat pork, fried brown, cut up into morsels, and swimming in gravy. The company being seated round the genial board, and each furnished with a fork, evinced their dexterity in launching at the fattest pieces in this mighty dishin much the same manner as sailors harpoon porpoises at sea, or our Indians spear salmon in the lakes. Sometimes the table was graced with immense apple-pies, or saucers full of preserved peaches and pears; but it was always sure to boast an enormous dish of balls of sweetened dough, fried in hog's fat, and called doughnuts, or olykoeksa delicious kind of cake, at present scarce known in this city, except in genuine Dutch families."

<b>Doughnut Day</b><br>
Today Americans observe Donught Day on the first Friday in June. In years past, it was celebrated in October and May, on Tuesdays or
Fridays.  "Doughnut Day" launched in 1917 as a way to support the morale of American troops stations during World War I. 
It began as a huge bake sale, selling real doughnuts at premium prices for charitable purpose. In the 1920s the drive was held in 
many cities and hosted by several organizations. In 1927 Chicago-based Salvation Army drive experienced trouble when they began selling
tags along with real doughnuts, baked by homemakers, professional bakeries and restaurants. Chicago city council regulated these tags and the operation was temporarily shut down. 
In 1938 the modern Doughnut Day, selling paper doughnuts (aka tags), launched in Chicago. The annual charity drive continued
to grow and was a success on all counts. Today's Americans celebrate Doughnut Day with freebies promoted by chain
restaurants.
<p>
<b>Why doughnuts?</b><br>
The Salvation Army was famous for providing doughnuts to the troops during World War I. What kind of doughnuts were
distributed on the first Doughnut Day? History does not record. In 1938, the doughnuts were made from paper. This was not a free food giveaway program, but a true charity drive.

"Reports from the trade sections of the Salvation Army doughnut fund campaign indicate that approximately $100,000 has been collected from 
that sources...Today will be doughnut day, and 40,000 'sinkers' will be on sale on the streets. It is hoped that for every doughnut eaten in the 
loop there will be a contribution for a half dozen doughnuts in the trenches. Bakeries will handle about half of the supply, but the wome of seven clubs 
will make the balance of them. They will be sold from trucks."

When daylight peeped into the kitchens of Mrs. Vincent Astor's home...amateur 'chefs' and Salvation Army experts ...took stock and found that
 17,000 doughnuts had been cooked during the night. In other kitchens the women had been busy and when noon--'the doughnut hour'--came around, there were 125,000 tempting reasons why they called it 'Doughnut day.' Eighty-five per cent of the doughnuts were prepared by volunteer workers...Selling at no less than $1 each, they enriched the fund by nearly $200,000...The hotel and restaurant division of the New York City Trades Committee,,...said that all hostelries had agreed to observe every day during the rest of the week as a doughnut day.

"Many a debutante from Chicago's gold coast district had her first skirmish yesterday with the uniformed guardians of the law when an order was issued by Chief of Police Michael Hughes directing his men to stop the disposal by the volunteer workers of Salvation Army buttons in return for contributions to that organization's Doughnut day drive. A hubbub ensued, repercussions being felt at the campaign headquarters on Wacker drive, where the women poured in to learn what course to pursue, and at the city hall, where Salvation Army officials immediately appeared to straighten out the tangle. Sale of the buttons, it was charged, constituted an infringement on the ordinance prohibiting all tag days except the three authorized by the city council. Sale of the doughnuts which accompanied them was held to be legal and commendable, and should be allowed to continue. Protest by officials of the Army and of the campaign availed nothing in the end...the matter was amicably adjusted. The workers were advised to return to their posts and continue the sale of their doughnuts, but to keep the buttons out of sight, which they did. The trouble arose because of the recent revision of the tag day ordinance, it was explained. it is estimated by Army workers that the mix up lost the organization many thousands of dollars. The buttons were being given out with the doughnuts, they said, and those who did not care to carry the doughnut took the button. In the suburbs the buttons alone were offered, as in past years. Thomas H. Byrne, superintendent of streets, issued the license to the Army, as he has done for the last seven years."

"This year's Salvation Army Doughnut Day will be held on Friday in Chicago and 135 surrounding communities. The event began in 1938, and Mrs. Henry D. Paschen has been its original and only chairman for the 41 continuous years of its existence. During that time, Doughnut Day has raised millions of dollars to support the social welfare services of the salvation Army in Greater Chicago. The idea for Doughnut day began in 1917 on the battlefields of France when Salvation Army lassies served coffee and doughnuts to World War I soldiers. Poor rations, rain, mud, and homesickness had caused morale to suffer, and the idea was conceived as a means of bringing them men cheer. The original idea was to bake pies, cakes, and bread for the men, but at the front no stoves or ovens were available for baking and supplies were scarce. The doughnuts became a symbol of the Salvation Army's commitment to both the physicals and spiritual welfare of the American soldier and his allies. Since 1917, millions of doughnuts have been served to soldiers, firemen, police, disaster victims, and others. metropolitan Chicago is the only area of the country with an official Doughnut day."

<b>Who's responsible for creating the doughnut hole?</b><br>
Popular foodlore credits Captain Hanson Gregory, a Maine sailor with a love for doughnuts. True or not, the story
is compelling and fun.
<p>
"The first American doughnuts did not have holes at all; they were quite literally little "nuts" of
dough. The Pilgrims, who had spent the years 1607-1620 in Holland, learned to make doughnuts
there and brought them to New England; the most direct antecedent of the pastry seems to be of
German origin, and these doughnuts came in all shapes and sizes. The first mention of the term in
print was in Washington Irving's History of New York...[1809]...
The Pennsylvania Dutch were probably the first to make doughnuts with holes in their centers,
a perfect shape for "dunking"...in coffee, which has become a standard method of eating
doughtnuts for Americans. There seems little real evidence to support the story of a Rockport,
Maine, sea captain named Hanson Crockett Gregory, who claimed to have poked out the soggy
centers of his wife's doughnuts in 1847 so that he might slip them over the spokes of his ship's
wheel, thereby being able to nibble while keeping an even keel. Nevertheless, in 1947, a centenary
plaque commemorating Gregory's alleged culinary creation was placed on the house where he had
lived. By the middle of the nineteenth century the hole must have been widely accepted, and a
housewares catalog of 1870 shows a doughnut cutter including a corer, as does the 1897 Sears,
Roebuck Catalog...By the twentieth century doughnuts, dusted with powdered sugar or
cinnamon, iced, or stuffed with jelly...or cream...had become an American favorite..."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar Friedman:New
York] 1999 (p. 114-5)<br>
[NOTE: We have a copy of an article from the [Boston] <i>Times</i> dated Saturday Evening, January 30, 1808, containing
this phrase "...then the company sat round the large round table to their tea, while a plentiful supply of fire-cakes and dough-nuts 
furnished out the repast..." "Sketches and Views, No. V. (Volume 1, No. 8, page 1)]

<b>Probable source of above information</b><br>
"The man who invented the hole in the doughnut has been found. He is Capt. Hanson Gregory, at present
 an inmate in Sailor's Snug Harbor, at Quincy, Mass. Doughnut cutters have made fortunes for men; millions eat doughnuts for breakfast and feel satisfied. Doctors
 do not assail the doughnut. And all of this owes its being to Capt. Gregory, who made the doughnut a safe, sane and hygienic food. It's a long story, mates; but as 
the 85-year-old chap relates it, it's only too short. Outside the fact that Capt. Gregory is a bit hard of hearing, he's as sound as new timber. He's a product of
 Maine; and so Maine can lay claim to the discoverer of the hole in the doughnut, along with the discoverer of new ways to evade the prohibition laws. But Capt. 
Gregory's discovery is of real use in the world; millions have risen, and millions more shall rise up, and call him blessed. _'Bout '47 Was the Date._ "It was way 
back--oh, I don't know just what year--let me see--born in '31, shipped when I was 13--well, I guess it was about '47, when I was 16, that I was aboard ship 
and discovered the hole which was later to revolutionize the doughnut industry. "I first shipped aboard the Isaac Achorn, three-masted schooner, Capt. Rhodes, in
 the lime trade. Later I joined other crews and other captains, and it was on one of these cruises that I was mawing doughnuts. "Now in them days we used to cut 
the doughnuts into diamond shapes, and also into long strips, bent in half, and then twisted. I don't think we called them doughnuts then--they was just 'fried cakes'
 and 'twisters.' "Well, sir, they used to fry all right around the edges, but when you had the edges done the insides was all raw dough. And the twisters used to sop
 up all the grease just where they bent, and they were tough on the digestion." "Pretty d--d tough, too!" profanely agreed one of the dozen pipe-smoking fellows 
who were all eyes and ears, taking in their comrade's interview by The Post reporter. With a glance at the perfervid interrupter, the discoverer continued: "Well, 
I says to myself, 'Why wouldn't a space inside solve the difficulty?' I thought at first I'd take one of the strips (Col. 2--ed.) and roll it around, then I got an
 inspiration, a great inspiration. "I took the cover off the ship's tin pepper box, and--I cut into the middle of that doughnut the first hole ever seen by mortal eyes!" 
"Were you pleased?" "Was Columbus pleased? Well, sir, them doughnuts was the finest I ever tasted. No more indigestion--no more greasy sinkers--but just 
well-done, fried-through doughnuts. "That cruise over, I went home to my old mother and father in Camden, Me., where I was born. My father, Hanson 
Gregory, sr., lived to be 93, and my mother lived to be 79. She was a pretty old lady then. I saw her making doughnuts in the kitchen--I can see her now, and as
 fine a woman as ever-lived, was my mother. _Taught Trick to Mother._ "I says to her: 'Let me make some doughnuts for you.' She says all right, so I made her 
one or two and then showed her how. "She then made several panfuls and sent them down to Rockland, just outside Camden. Everybody was delighted and they
 never made doughnuts any other way except the way I showed my mother. "Well, I never took out a patent on it; I don't suppose any one can patent anything he
 discovers; I don't suppose Peary could patent the north pole or Columbus patent America. But I thought I'd get out a doughnut cutter--but somebody got in ahead 
of me. _Hole "Cut Out," His Joke._ "Of course a hole ain't so much; but it's the best part of the doughnut--you'd think so if you had ever tasted the doughnuts we 
used to eat in '31. Of course, lots of people joke about the hole in the doughnut. I've got a joke myself: Whenever anybody says to me: 'Where's the hole in the 
doughnut?' I always answer: 'It's been cut out!'" and the old chap laughed loud and long at his little sally, while the rest joined in. So there he sits--in the Snug Harbor
 by the sea. And whenever there's doughnuts on the day's fare, Capt. Gregory takes a personal pride trying to do what nobody's succeeded in doing yet--in trying
 to find the hole in the doughnut. And whenever the old salts rally him about it, he always springs his little joke: "The hole's been cut out, I guess!" to the delight of 
the whole shipful."<br>

"Excuse us while we indulge in a When Harry Met Sally moment as we simply gaze at this edible decadence, the cronut.
Combining two of our favourite foods together: the doughnut and croissant, pastry chef Dominique Ansel has created in one word, a masterpiece at his eponymous bakery in New York City. While layers of flaky pastry dough deep-fried and dressed in flavoured sugar is already a winner in our books, lets thank Ansel for taking it one step further filling these babies with heavenly vanilla pastry cream and cloaking them in rose glaze (image below).

This bakery feat was almost rocket science to produce according to Grub Street New York and entailed testing several recipes and frying temperatures. Kudos to
 Ansel for figuring it all out. If youre in New York next month, stop by for a cronut featuring maple syrup cream and lemon maple glaze. Word to pastry addicts:

Crullers (aka Wonders) were intoduced to the New World by Dutch cooks. Then, as today, these <a href="foodfaq1.html#doughnuts">
doughnut-type fried cakes</a> were quite popular. What are crullers?
<p>
"'Crullers' (Dutch krullen) were an early egg-dough pastry shaped by the New Amsterdam Dutch into "love knots" or "matrimony
knots" or the elongated shape that became familiar throughout the country. Sometimes crullers were called "wonders," and
among the Creoles, croque-cignole."<br>

<p>
"Crullers, or Crulla.
Crullers always have been associated with Dutch cookery in America. Ann Stevenson's recipe for them, entitled "Crulla"
simply reads: "3 lbs. flour, 12 eggs, 1 lb. sugar, and a little butter & some Nutmeg." It makes plain, rather crisp,
fritters that can be dusted with confectioners' or cinnamon-sugar for extra flavor.<br>
5 tablespoons butter<br>
1/4 cup sugar<br>
2 cups flour<br>
2 eggs<br>
1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg<br>
Oil for deep-frying.<br>
Cream butter and sugar, add eggs one at a time. Then add flour and nutmeg to make a smooth dough. Turn it out on a 
board and cut into 20 even pieces. Roll each piece out to a 6-inch rope. Fold the rope in half and twist the ends around
each other, leaving an opening in the middle. An alternate method for shaping the crullers is to roll out the dough
1/4-inch thick. With a pie jagger cut into strips 1/2-inch wide and 3 inches long. Twist two strips together. Heat the oil
to 350 degrees and deep-fry the crullers until golden and done. Remove and immediately sprinkle with confectioners'
or cinnamon-sugar, if desired. Makes 20. 
<p>
<b>"Krullen.</b><br>
Here is a completely different version of the cruller. The recipe is adapted from a nineteenth century Dutch cookbook that
survived only as a fragment without a title page. This version resembles more closely Washington Irving's description in his
"Legend of Sleepy Hollow." The author describes a Dutch tea table set for guests which included "Such heaped up platters
of cakes of various and almost indescribable kinds, known ony to experienced Dutch housewives. There was the doughy
dough nut, the tenderer oly koek, and the crisp and crumbling cruller..." (Irving, 287.) This recipe creates a crisp and
crumbling cruller, or cork-screw krul (curl). <br>
9 tablespoons butter (no substitutes)<br>
1 egg<br>
1 2/3 cups flour (tapped down)<br>
2 tablespoons heavy cream, if needed.<br>
Cream the butter until light and fluffy. Add the egg and incorporate. Add the flour a little at a time. If the dough is too
stiff, add some cream. Roll to a thickness of 1/6 inch and cut into strips of approximately 3/4-inch wide (it does not
matter how long they are). Twist around the handle of a wooden spoon to make a corkscrew curl. Gently slide off the handle
into hot oil at aobut 350 degrees. Fry until golden brown and slightly puffed. Drain on paper towels. Sift confectioners'
sugar over each curl before serving."<br>

"Beignet. The French denoting a general class of small, light, batter-coated, deep-fried items equivalent to

strong, and the beignets are a specialty of New Orleans. 'Beignet' also has a specific gastronomical
meaning of deep-fried choux pastry...Choux paste is popular in many countries for making fritters."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.70)
<p>
<b>Candian-French description</b><br>
"Beigne harks back to a non-Indo-European pre-Roman word like *bunnia, directly related to Gaelic bun and Catalan bony 'bump on the 
head.'...When beigne first shows up in 17th century French, it meant: 'bump on the head' and also 'tree stump.' The present
meaning of beigne today in France is slap or clout or blow, in other word, what might cause a bump on the head. English borrowed its word
bun for a little form of leavened bread from a French dialectic offshoot of the same root, bugne, that denoted a slightly raised
pancake. But all the food references obviously began a jokes in which a bump of bread (a bun) was compared to a bump on the head.
...Beigne is a Canadian French usage showing how ancient meaning of words can remain in a dialect while disappearing from a standard language. The
word for doughnut today in France is a later, diminutive form, beignet. It means 'fritter' as well in France. Among les 
Quebecois et les Acadiens, un beignet is also a fritter or a pancake. A familiar Acadian dish is beignets rapes 'potato fritters,'
while beignets a la rapture are potato pancakes made by blending finely grated potatoes in an egg-and-flour batter, forming them into palm-sized
pancakes, patting them thin, and frying until crispy brown. In current Quebec slang there is a...put-down, begnet 'dummy, stupid
person,' which is very close to the Ontario expression 'Don't be such a doughnut.'"<br>

Beignet is a general term used to designate any item or mixture of food which has been dipped in frying butter and then deep

is always accompanied by Tomato Sauce whereas a fritter is invariably served without an accompaniment. Beignets must be fried

<b>Calas</b><br>
Calas are deep-fried rice cakes, a specialty of New Orleans Creole Cuisine. Classic street cuisine. Historic notes & recipes here:
<blockquote>
<b>[1938] <br>
"Calas</b>..."Belle Cala! Tout Chaud!" Under this cry was sold by the ancient Creole negro women in the French Quarter of New Orleans a delicious rice cake, 
which was eaten with the morning cup of Cafe au Lait. The Cala woman was a daily figure in the streets till within the last two or three years. She went her rounds
 in quaint bandana tignon, guinea blue dress and white apron, and carried on her head a covered bowl, in which were the dainty and hot Calas. Her cry,
 "Belle Cala! Tout Chaud!" would penetrate the morning air, and the olden Creole cooks would rush to the doors to get the first fresh, hot Calas to carry to their
 masters and mistresses with the early morning cup of coffee. The Cala women have almost all passed away. But the custom of making Calas still remains. In many 
an ancient home the good housewife tells her daughter just how "Tante Zizi" made the Calas in her day, and so are preserved these ancient traditional recipes. From 
one of the last of the olden Cala women, one who has walked the streets of the French Quarter for fifty years and more, we have the following established Creole 
recipe: <br>
1/2 Cup Rice <br>
3 Cups Water (boiling) <br>
3 Eggs <br>
1/2 Cup Sugar. <br>
1/2 Cake of Compressed Yeast. <br>
1/2 Teaspoonful of Grated Nutmeg. <br>
Powdered White Sugar. <br>
Boiling Shortening. <br>
Put thre cups of water in a saucepan and let it boil hard. Wash half a cup of rice thoroughly, and drain and put in the boiling water. Let it boil till very soft and mushy. Take it out and set is to cool. When cold, mash 
well and mix with the yeast, which you will have dissolved in a half cup of hot water. Set the rice to rise overnight. In the morning beat three eggs thoroughly, and 
add to the rice, mixing and beating well. Add a half cup of sugar and three tablespoonfuls of flour, to make the rice adhere. Mix well and beat thoroughly, 
bringing it to a thick batter. Set to rise for fifteen minutes longer. The add about a half teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, and mix well. Have ready a frying pan, in which 
there is sufficient quantity of shortening boiling for the rice cakes to swim in it. Test by dropping in a small piece ob bread. If it becomes a golden brown the
 shortening is ready, but if it burns or browns instantly it is too hot. The golden brown color is the true test. Take a large deep spoon, and drop a spoonful at a time 
of the preparation into the boiling shortening, remembering always that the cake must not touch the bottom of the pan. Let fry to a nice brown. The old Cala woman 
used to take the Calas piping hot, wrap them in a clean towel, put them into a capacious basket or bowl, and rush through the streets with the welcome cry, 
"Belle Cala! Tout Chaud!" ringing on the morniing air. But in families the cook simply takes the Calas out of the frying pan and drains off the shortening by laying in a
 colander or on heated pieces of brown paper. They are then placed in a hot dish, and sprinkled over with powdered white sugar, and eaten hot with Cafe au 
Lait." <br>

<b>Fritters</b><br>
Fritters (aka frytors, frytos) are <a href="foodmeats.html#deepfrying">deep-fried</a> batters containing sweet (fruit & nuts) or savory
(cheese, fish, vegetables) fillings. Food historian confirm fritter-type foods were consumed by Ancient Romans, who
introduced this recipe to Europe during their conquest. Modern French <a href="foodfaq1.html#beignets">beignets</a> and Spanish Frittatas are a direct 
descendant. 
<p>
"Fritter. The English word for a small portion of deep-fried batter, usually but not always
containing a piece of fruit, meat, fish or vegetable. Fritters are generally eaten immediately after
cooking, as, like all deep-fried foods, they taste best hot and fresh...Fritters are often sold at fairs,
freshly cooked a special stalls. In several countries they are made as part of the carnival binge of
rich foods, eaten before the fast of Lent begins...The Roman  scriblita, described by Cato in the
2nd Century BC, was probably a precursor of both fritters and doughnuts. Lumps of moist dough
(leavened with sourdough) were spooned into hot fat, and allowed to stream in random shapes.
Medieval  cryspeys were described in the Harlean MS of 1430; a liquid yeast batter using the
whites of eggs only was run down the cook's fingers so that five narrow streams entered the hot
oil, where they set into a tangle. They were served sprinkled with sugar...Medieval batters for
sweet fritters, like those for pancakes, contained wine or ale, sometimes cream, and more eggs
than are usual today. Choux paste mixtures were in use for making fritters in France by the end of
the 16th century...in the 18th century [fritters] were piped with a forcing bag. This shape survives
in the old French bugne and the American cruller."<br>
---<i>The Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford]
1999 (p. 320-1)
<p>
"Fritters are portions of food--fruit, vegetables, seafood--coated in batter and deep-fried. The
name reflects the method of cooking; it was borrowed in the fourteenth century from Old French
friture, which came ultimately from Latin frigere,  'fry'. The cooking method itself is said to have
been introduced from the Middle East by Crusaders returning to Wester Europe...The Japanese
equivalent to fritters is tempura."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 133)
<p>
"Egg-batter fritters containing meat, fish or fruit were fried in lard or oil. Apple fritters, strewn
with sugar when it was available, were prehaps the best loved, but fritters of skirrets or parsnips
were well liked too, because of their natural sweetness. The physicians condemned fritters as
indigestible, but they remained irresistable to the layman and appeared regularly in medieval
menus, usually as part of the last course. John Russell observed that "apple fritter is good hot, but
the cold ye [should] not touch." Herb fritters, the batter aerated with a little yeast, and "fritters of
milk" were made from curds and egg whites were two other popular versions."<br>

<p>
<b>The French Fry connection?</b><br>
Karen Hess makes this connection between fritters and <a href="foodfaq1.html#frenchfries">french fries</a>:<br>
"The earliest receipt that can unequivocally be identified as calling for the frying of sliced raw
potatoes that I have found is one given in La Cuisiniere Republicaine. Among some thirty-five
receipts for pommes de terre there is one for '[Pommes de terre] Enfriture", which involves the
classic fritter method, that is, thin slices, dipped in batter and fried in deep fat, an ancient
procedure recorded in medieval manuscripts, early making its way to English court cuisine as in
this archetypical receipt for 'Fretoure' calling for making the batter, then 'take fayre Applys, & kut
hem in man'er of Fretourys,' dipping the slices of apple in the batter and frying them in 'layre Oyle.'
In short, a procedure already so established even in early fifteenth-century England that one is to
'kut hem in man'er of Fretourys,' that is, raw in slices, and so understood. Note that all the terms
come directly from the French: Frire and friture always refer to frying in deep fat. Always. What
we now know as French fries may have started out as potato fritters, but it would not have taken
long for French cooks to realise that potatoes are starchy enough not to need the coating of batter
to provide the attractive characterizing crust of deep fried foods; that may well have occurred
long before 1795, given the historical lag between practice and the printed word. I note that La
Cuisiniere Republicaine is thought to have been written by a woman, not a chef (the cover title,
Paix au Chaumieres, salutes women who are out of work - an early feminist cookbook).3 Chefs
had other worries in 1795, and many of them had already fled France, among them Louis
Eustache Ude and very likely Honore Julien, who was to become chef de cuisine at the President's
House."<br>

<b>"Warsaw Paczki</b><br>
Paczki that are carefully made precisely according to this recipe are superior to even the best confectioner's paczki. However, 
the 
recipe is not inexpensive and is not for young housewives who are taking their first steps in the noble art of cooking. The art of 
frying paczki also takes up a lot of time and if they are to be served on New Years' Eve (they must still be lukewarm!), their
preparation must be begun in the early afternoon hours. Begin with the preparation of the yeast by dissolving 2-2 1/2 oz. of it in 
milk (about (1/3 cup), along with 4 oz. flour and 1 tablespoon sugar. When the yeast rises enough, add 1 lb flour, 8 egg yolks 
creamed with 3 oz sugar, about 1/2 pint, about 1/2 pint barely lukiewarm sweet cream (heated only, but not boiling), ground vanilla
(1/2 bean) sifted through a dense sieve, 6 oz. melted lukewarm butter, 1/3 teaspoon salt and a glass of spirit. Some very finely
grated lemon rind may also be added. Knead the dough well by hand; when it does not stick to the hands of bowl, it is ready. It should not
be too thick, but shiny and springy. When it starts to rise again, take out c. 1 1/2 oz. portions with a tablespoon (it is best to 
weigh each one, so that the paczki will be of equal size), shape into small circles by hand, place 1/2 teaspoon filling in the middle,
fold over and shape into a ball. Place with the join underneath on a cloth of dusted flour. Cover the paczki with a clean cloth.
When they expand to almost twice their size, gently remove the flour with a brush or feather. Fry them in portions in intensely heated
lard, in shallow and wide saucepan so that they float freely in the fat without touching each other. In order to avoid 
excessive browning, 2-3 slices of raw potato may be added to the hot lard, or 1-2 tablespoons water may be added from time to
time. When the paczki brown underneath, turn them over gently. When done, take them out carefully (e.g. in a wide
horsehair sieve or on white blotting papper), drain off the fat and, while still warm, dust liberally with castor sugar and with
ground sifted vanilla. Lukewarm paczki may be iced with a thin punch icing and the moist icing sprinkled with very finely chopped
candied orange peel. The classical filling for Polish paczki are well-drained rose hip preserves mixed with very finely chopped, or
preferably ground, almonds. For this recipe the filling must be made from 6 oz. lightly heated ground rose hip preserve
(weigh after draining off the excess syrup!) and 2 oz. ground (blanched) almonds."<br>

<b>Persians</b><br>

  Persians are unique and legendary in Thunder Bay, Ontaria, Canada. It is unlikely anyone (who knows the secret!) will
  share the recipe.
  <p>
  "And then there are Persians--cinnamon buns with pink icing. "They're unique to us," boasts Marilyn
  McIntosh, tourism development co-oridinator for the City of Thunder Bay. "We used to have them in
  our high school cafeteria. It's a once-a-year treat that takes you back to childhood." Bennett's Bakery
  invented Persians in the 1930s and named them in honor of Gen. John J. "Black Jack" Pershing, one
  of America's most famous army officers of World War I. "Thunder Bay is the only place in the world
  where they're made, and the're even in the dictionary," boasts Joe Nucci, whose family bought
  Bennett's Bakery in 1964 and launched a spinoff business, the Persian Man, in 1992. The Canadian
  Oxford Dictionary defines Persians, among other things, as a Canadian word from northwestern
  Ontario that refers to "an oblong doughnut covered with pink or white icing." "Well, they got the
  doughnut part wrong," sniffs Nucci, who sells hundreds of 85 cent Persians each year. "It's not made
  from doughnut dough. It's made from a sweet dough. And the icing has strawberry and raspberry jam,
  but that's the secret." The upscale Aurora Grille sells Persians to customers celebrating a birthday--gussied up with a

<b>Zeppole</b><br>

Food historians tell us fritter-type foods (fried dough) have been enjoyed by people since Ancient
Rome. Variations are endless, including doughnuts, waffles, struffoli, and zeppole.  Many are
traditionally connected with religious holidays. Eggless versions are especially connected with
the Christian observance of Lent. About <a href="foodfaq1.html#fritters">fritters</a>. 
<p>
<p>
Zeppole are featured at the Italian Feast of San Guiseppe (Saint Joseph), celebrated on March
19th. The name is said to derive from German Count Ferdinand Graf von Zeppelin [1838-1917].
His "Zeppelins" (blimps, air ships)  attacked the city of Naples in 1918. Possibly? Some
oblong-shaped traditional fried dough foods were renamed at this time. March 19th usually falls
within Lent. 
<p>
"Neapolitans claim that zeppole were invented in Naples someteims in the Middle Ages, wehn they were made with a little white ine
and a branc of rosemary. They had a whole new incarnation in the nineteenth cnetuyr, when a certain Don Pasquale Pintauro presented the waiting
worlds with sweet zeppole for San Giuseppe's Day. These light-as-air doughnuts are made of bigne dough, fried, then filled with a 
delicious pastry cream and each one topped with a single amarena, the preserved wild cherry of Italy"<br>

"Until a few years ago, the Feast of San Giuseppe was a national holiday, but now it is only optional. The table of San
Giuseppe started in the sourth, not only in Sicily but also in Apulia and Abruzzo, where it is still celebrated and knwon as
<i>La Mattredda</i>, from the <i>madia</i>, the deep wooden chest in which women make the bread dough. The numbers of <i>cene</i>
are diminishing, but the day itslef is still marked all over the peninsula by bonfires...The feasting persists. Special sweets are prepared all over
Italy, and shapes may differ from region to region, they come both empty, as fritelle and zeppole, and filled,as bigne di San
Guiseppe, zeppole again, or sfincie in Sicily. may are filled with sweeteed ricotta or custard cream...The zeppole eaten in Umbria, 
Florence, and eastern Sicily are made of rice, whole those in Sardinia, Lazio, Campania, and points south are based on flour. When
the pastries are filled they someetimes change their name to frittelle, confetti or bigne...Southern Italian immigrants have

<b>Funnel cakes</b><br>
Although fried breads of many kinds were eaten by Ancient Romans and Greeks, food historians

<p>
Food historians frequently remind us that recipes often predate their current "popular" names.
Such is the case with funnel cakes. Modern dictionaries and food references generally place
"funnel cakes" in the 20th century. Culinary evidence confirms the recipe is much older.
<p>
The oldest authentic German recipe we have for an item that would create what we now call
"funnel cakes" is from 1879. The original cookbook is in German.  Gisela Harpell, one of our
colleagues at the Morris County Library, was kind enough to offer this translation:<br>
<blockquote>

Davidis. 23rd Edition. Pub. Velhagen & Klasing. Bielefeld and Leipzig, 1879.
<p>
<b>Recipe: p.468. #248 "Pressed Pastry cooked in melted Butter"</b><br>
200 gr. fine flour, an equivalent amount of water, 100 gr. butter, 5 eggs,1 tablespoon sugar,
grated rind of 1/2 lemon.
        Bring water and butter to the boil, gradually add the flour,and stir until the dough turns
dry and does not stick to the pot. Remove the pot from the fire, to the hot mixture add 1 egg,
lemon rind, sugar, and when cooled gradually add the remaining eggs one at a time. The
dough is then firmly beaten, added to a syringe, pressed into the hot melted butter, baked to a
yellow color according to the instructions in #246, dusted with sugar and cinnamon.
<p>
#246, p466-467 listed detailed instructions for baking in butter, lard and oil.
<p>
[TRANSLATOR'S NOTE: This is a more literal translation because I wanted to keep some of
the flavor of the original. The title page also mentions that this cookbook is designed for
beginning cooks and new housewives. The author also states that the recipes are reliable and
have been tested by Henriette Davidis. She also includes instructions for entertaining and
menues for the various seasons.]
</blockquote>
The oldest recipe we find for a recipe titled "funnel cake"in an English language book is
this:<br><blockquote>

<b>[1935]</b><br>
"Mix 1 pint of sweet milk, 2 eggs well beaten, (yolks and whites together), enough flour to make
a thin batter, 1/2 teaspoonful baking powder, 1/4 teaspoonful salt. Mix in a pan thoroughly. Place
enough lard in a pan to cover the bottom. Let it get quite hot before cooking the batter. Now put
the batter through a funnel into the hot lard, beginning at center of pan, and turning the stream
around in a gradual enlarging circle, being careful not to touch the sides of the other dough. Fry a
light brown and serve hot with any tart jelly."<br>

<b>Mexican Funnel Cake</b><br>

---"If They Fry It, We Will Buy It at the Fair: A Consumer's Guide to all things greasy," Peter Rowe, <i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i>, June 14, 2008 (p. 1) 
<p>
Who can we thank for this invention? According to this article, Mike Peterson, of the Heart Attack Cafe. Mr. Peterson's eatery was renamed the "Deep Fried 
Butter Stand" in 2011 to avoid a lawsuit of trademark infringement. 
<p>
"Just about every possible usage of the ingredient is on display at the Heart Attack Cafe, a stand operated by San Diego resident Mike Peterson, the same mad
 genius who brought us chocolate-covered bacon and the Mexican funnel cake. "We wanted a name that was fitting," Peterson said. "I always heard people, 
when we were ringing up at the register, say that 'Oh, this is an instant heart attack.' And so we decided to have a little fun." And what could be more fun than 
deep-fried butter? That dish - essentially fat cooked in fat - stars on a gut-busting, lip- glistening menu that also includes French fries drenched with butter, 
deep-fried quesadillas drenched with butter and cinnamon- sugar chips drenched with heart-healthy wheatgrass (just kidding, they're also drenched with butter). 
Calorie counts aren't posted, but fairgoers won't need a medical degree to understand the concerns. Besides its playful name, the Heart Attack Cafe features dishes
 nicknamed "Triple Bypass" and "Flatliner" as well as a prominent photo of a nurse wielding a defibrillator. Appropriately, when the stand debuted this year at the 
San Diego County Fair, it neighbored the paramedics' headquarters. "So the (ambulance) and fair EMTs are stationed right next to our stand how great is that,"
 says a posting on the stand's Facebook page. By promoting a roster of death-defying delights, the Heart Attack Cafe is venturing into territory long dominated by 
Charlie Boghosian, aka "Chicken Charlie." Known for inventing the Krispy Kreme Chicken Sandwich, Boghosian this year is tossing Klondike bars, Twinkies and 
avocados into the deep fryer, but he doesn't claim a monopoly on food that will make your left arm numb. "America was built on competition," Boghosian said.
 "There's plenty of room for success." For his part, Peterson confesses zero desire for a turf war. "Charlie's a good friend of mine, and he does an awesome job
 and comes out with awesome new products," Peterson said. "He's still the fry king out here." Peterson's piece de resistance, the deep-fried butter, actually started
 out as a more ambitious meal. "We were going to do chocolate- covered, bacon-wrapped deep-fried butter, but it proved too hard to combine all those in a
 fashion that wasn't too labor intensive," he explained. As it is, the butter dish comes in sweet and savory varieties, the former featuring cinnamon-sugar and the
 latter featuring garlic. In each, the butter is combined with cream cheese, then injected into churros, plugged with dough at both ends and frozen to await frying.
 "It tastes, because of the way we do it, like a really gooey, buttery, sugary fried dough," Peterson said. "All those things combining is just perfect. You wouldn't 
want to down four of them, but ... if I try a little bite, just for quality control, I usually end up finishing it." But does he worry about blowback? Is fried butter too
 obscene, even for fair food? "I think everybody knows that the fair comes once a year," Peterson replied, "and it's your chance to splurge and have that thing you 
wouldn't eat any other time.""<br>

"Dumpling. A term of uncertain origin which first appeared in print at the beginning of the 17th
century, although the object it denotes--a small and usually globular mass of boiled or steamed
dough--no doubt existed long before that. A dumpling is a food with few, indeed no, social
pretentions, and of such simplicity that it may plausibly be supposed to have evoloved
independently in the peasant cuisines of various parts of Europe and probably in other parts of the
world too. Such cuisines feature soups and stews, in which vegetables may be enhanced by a little
meat. Dumplings, added to the soup or stew, are still, as they were centuries ago, a simple and
economical way of extending such dishes. The dough for most dumplings has always been based
either on cereal, whichever was the staple in a given region (oats, wheat, maize, etc.), or on one
of vegetables from which bread dough can be made...(potato, pulses, etc.)...However, despite its
simplicity, the humble dumpling, or anyway the range of foods to which the name is applied, has
evolved in the course of time from the prototypes into something more complex. A first step was
provided by the filled dumpling, in which the dough encloses something else, for  example apple in
an apple dumpling, and a sour Zwetschke  cooking plum (its stone replaced by a lump of sugar) in
the Austrian and Czech Zwetschkenknodel...[in] Europe, it would be fair to say that dumplings
are almost ubiquitous in that continent, but by no means of equal importance in the various
countries. They are more popular in colder climates...there are three regions in which they have
flourished most: England...the much larger area of C. Europe (including Bavaria, Austria, Bohemia)...and the specialized 
habitat provided by Italy for gnocchi."<br>

"Dumpling. A ball of dough, originally savoury and served as an accompaniment to meat or as a
dessert...A simple, satisfying food, dumplings were boiled and served to extend small amounts of
meat. Originally made by shaping small portions from a batch of bread dough before specific
mixtures were developed using flour, cereals, pulses, stale bread, potatoes or cheese, sometimes
with a raising agent added or enriched with fat in the form of suet, were developed. Local
ingredients and method are used across Europe to make a variety of large or small dumplings,
plain or flavoured with herbs, vegetables, spices or other ingredients...Dumplings are closely
related to pasta. Italian gnocchi are good examples of small dumplings usually grouped with pasta
and the spatzle of German and Austria, made from batter simmered until set in finger noodles,
also hover between the two descriptions. Polish plain or filled dumplings are also very similar to
gnocchi or filled pasta...The name dumpling is also used for Oriental specialties, such as the small
filled dumplings of Chinese cookery, related more closely to pasta than European-style
dumplings."<br>

<B>Central European dumplings</b><br>
"In the region of Bavaria...Austria and Bohemia...the common material of dumplings is stale bread. This is broken into small
pieces and soaked in water or milk, and combined with any available enriching ingredients: bacon, eggs, cheese, chopped liver, or herbs.
 There are several sweet types stuffed with fruit...Another kind is the Nockerl, made from a softer dough of flour with butter, 
milk and egg (or leftover noodle dough...) Because the dough is soft, it is not rolled into balls to make the dumplings; small 
pieces are picked off with the fingers and throw into the boiling water...Another related dumpling, made in a similar manner,,
is the Spatzle...most common in the Alsace and S. Germany...The Dampfnudel ('steamed noodle') is...a medium-sized German dumpling
made of yeast dough, cooked in a shallow bath of milk in a tightly lidded pan...Potato dumpling tupes are exemplified by 
Kartoffelkloss...Other potato dumplings include the Russian Pampuska..."<br>

<b>Gnocchi</b><br>
Gnocchi is a classic example of what happened when "New World" foods met "Old World"
recipes. It took a century or two, but eventually most European countries and cuisines embraced
the potato and made it their own. Early potato recipes were not new inventions, they were new
twists on familiar traditions. Gnocchi were inspired by <a href="foodfaq1.html#dumplings">dumplings</a>.
<p>
"We don't know when the potato was introduced to Italy. It seems likely to have arrived via
Spain sometime between 1569 and 1588, when it is clearly described in a document as fodder for
pigs. Gnocchi, before the introduction of the potato, referred to little balls of flour or bread or
both that were boiled. The earliest of these recipes that I am aware of is the nochi of the
anonymous early fifteenth-century cookbook by the writer known as Anonimo Meridianale. But
even by 1692, when Antonio Latini published his Lo scallo alla moderna, gnocchi were still
made of flour and considered a kind of macaroni. In Genoa gnocchi are today called trofie, but
were originally a form of pasta secca in the Middle Ages, made from hard wheat flour and not
potatoes. Eventually the potato was used for making gnocchi and the result was heavenly."<br>
---<i>A Mediterranean Feast</i>, Clifford A. Wright [William Morrow:New York] 1999 (p. 61-2)
<p>
"Gnocchi, essentially a kind of dumpling, are distinguished from other dumplings by being
Italian and having a close link with pasta. The are made either from a pasta dough or from a
mixture of potato flour and wheat flour, or from semolina or maize (polenta)...The origin of
gnocchi is inescapably tied up with that of pasta, partly because at first a simliar mixture was used
to make both, and partly because many old works called both 'm'caroni'. (The confusion persists
in modern Padua). It has been suggested that the macaroni method mentioned in the Decameron
(1351) as being rolled down a mountain of grated Parmesan by the inhabitants of the mythical
land of Bengodi were actually gnocchi or they would not have rolled. The original four and water
mixture for gnocchi is still used in some parts of Italy, but mostly they are now made of potato
flour with a little wheat flour. This usage dates only from about 1860, but the curious Manutan
gnocchi made from pumpkin are two or three centuries older than that."<br>

"Although some authorities believe gnocchi may have originated in Piedmont, potato recipes
were far more popular in Liguria by the early 19th century, and there is a recipe for an elaborate
form of potato gnocchi containing veal fat and hard-boiled eggs in the fifth edition of Vincenzo
Corrado's Il Cuoco galante (1801)...Gnocchi is also the name of a small, rippled dried pasta
shell. The name gnocchi may derive from the Latin  'nucleus'..., though some authorites believe it
may derive from the Middle High German  'knochel' (knuckle.)<br>

may be cooked au gratin in the oven and served as a hot entree. This dish is Italian in origin (the
word means  lumps') and is classified with pasta, but it is also found in Austro-Hungarian and
Alsatian cookery in the form of knepfle, knodel, noques, or quenelles, which are all quite
familiar. Italian gnocci all Romana are made with semolina, egg and cheese' gnocci a la

dough. Divide the dough into 2-4 parts, form into finger-thick rolls and slice diagonally into small dumplings 1 inch thick.
Cook in a large amount of salted boiling water. Take out the cooked kopytka with a straining spoon and drain well. On a dish pour 
hot butter or pork fat with cracklings over this. 1 small, very finely chopped onion may be fried in the pork fat. The 
Kopytka may be cooked a day ahead. Before serving, throw them into boiling salted water and bing to a boil only once. They will be like

  "A classic Passover dish that has undergone a metamorphosis in this country is the
  venerable matzah ball. In the early nineteen hundreds, before commercial matza meal was
  available, these matzah dumplings were made with soaked or ground-up matzah, onions,
  eggs, chicken fat, and spices. They were also called "klose," "Kneidel," "kleis," or
  "kneidlach." Florence Kresiler Greenbaum in her <i>Jewish Cook Book</i> in the twenties
  includes and early recipe for what she called "matsah meal kleis." Soon after, the B.
  Manischewitz Company, in its <i>Tempting Kosher Dishes Cookbook</i> of 1930, called them
  "feather balls, Alsatian style," a matzah ball made from processed matzah meal with one
  whole cup of chicken fat (!). The term "matza balls rose to prominence in the 1930s--accompanied by all the Jewish mother jokes. The matza business was started by families
  like Goodman, Manischewitz, and Horowitz, all baked by Manischewitz today...The
  publication of Passover recipes almost kept pace with the volume of matzah production.
  Recipes were printed in company-sponsored cookbooks...and...on the backs of matzah
  packages. Other recipe evolved naturally as Jews adapted local dishes for Passover use."<br>

<a name="kreplach">
<b>Jewish kreplach</b><br>"Which came first--kreplackh, pirogi, ravioli, or wonton soup?
 Each country seems to have its own verion of a filled egg-noodle dough, either fried or boiled in water or soup. Most authorities think that this dish originated in 
China and worked its way via trade routes to the countries of the West. The Jews may have learned about kreplakh from the Chinese or the Italians. Maimonides 
traces cooked dough to Persia and the Middle East. The word 'kreplackh' itself comes form the French crepelle. Whatever the origin of the food, it requires effort
 and time to cut, fill, form, and enclose each of these three-cornered bits of dough filled with chopped meat. Thus, they are reserved for special occasions. The meat
 of the kreplakh symbolizes inflexible justice; the soft noodle dough denotes compassion. The kreplakh are, then, a metaphor, a suggestion that the attribute of 
God's strict justice will be mellowed on the side of mercy. These pockets of food where the meat is hidden inside the dough also refer to the hidden nature of the 
thre days they are eaten. Although the eve of Yom Kippur, Simhat Torah, and Purim are festivals for eating and drinking, work is not forbidden. The day prior to
 Yom Kippur is not a full holiday; and Simhat Torah people dance and drink; and on Purim the name of God is never mentioned."<br>

with gravy as a side dish with meat."<br>

<B>Russian Pel'meni</B><br>
"Almost every national cuisine boasts its own version of boiled dumplings wrapped around pockets of seasoned meat...
Pel'meni are the Siberian version, now popular throughout the Soviet Union. Moscow alone has several pel'menyanas, cafes 
specializing in these dumplings. Pel'meni are pratical for the harsh Siberian winter. Prepared in large quantities, they can be 
buried in the snow where they keep for months on end, ready to boil up at a moment's notice. Siberians swear by a mustard and
vinegar sauce for pel'meni: place a spoonful of hot mustard on the edge of each plate and mix it with concentrated vinegar to
taste. Muscovites prefer a milder garnish, slathering butter and soured cream on the dumplings in lavish amounts. Pel'meni are most
often served steaming hot, mounded high on a platter, but they may also be boiled in chicken broth and eaten with soup."<br>
---<i>A Taste of Russia</i>, Darra Goldstein [Jill Norman:London] 1983 (p. 183-184)
<p> 
"Pel'meni are filled with dumplings made of noodle dough, similar to ravioli. A Siberian contribution to Russian cuisine, 
they are of Mongolian origin. In Siberia...the filling is made of young horsemeat, which is frozen, cut into shavings, and seasoned
with onion, salt, and pepper. Small squares of noodle dough are filled, sealed, and then frozen in sacks for the whole winter, to
be cooked as needed. Nowadays, in European Russia, uncooked ground beef is used instead of horsemeat, and mushroom-filled pelmeni
are an accepted variation. Pel'meni are served in several ways: they can be cooked in stock or consomme and served in a bowl
with some of the soup. As a delicious main course for lunch or dinner, they can be served drenched in butter or Siberian-style...
sprinkled with vinegar and spiced with freshly ground pepper. In late nineteenth-century France, where Russian food had already
made a considerable impact on haute cuisine, pel'meni began to appear on restaurant menus, and, contrary to Russian custom, Escoffier
included them in his <i>Guide Culinaire</i> as a hot hors d'oeuvre. In Moscow, during the last quarter of the nineteenth century,
the best restaurant to eat pel'meni was Lopashov's, one of the oldest taverns in town...Lopashov's was the showcase of authentic 
Russian cuisine, and the most distinguised foreign visitors were invited there for intimate dinners in the izba...Lopashov was as 
much a perfectionist in shaping his menu as in furnishing his establishment. To offer genuine Siberian pel'meni, he brought the
best-known pel'meni chef from Siberia, and pel'meni connoisseiurs were his most devoted fans. When, in the 1880s, the owners of the 
most important Siberian gold mines had an exhibit in Moscow, their dinner at Lopahsov's Tavern made the front pages of the 
Moscow newspapers. In memory of the conqueror of Siberia, cossack chieftain Yermak, the dinner was named "A Feast in Yermak's
Field Camp." It consisted of two courses only: zakuski (hors d'oeuvre) and pel'meni. For the twelve participants, 2,500 pel'meni were 
cooked. There were meat pel'meni and fish pel'meni, and, as an innovation, fruit pel'meni in rose champagne glasses were
introduced as a dessert."<br>

<b>Southern USA Slicks (aka chicken & dumplings)</b><br>
Both <a href="foodmeats.html#chicken">chicken</a> & <a href="foodfaq1.html#dumplings">dumplings</a> are ancient. Recipes vary according to culture/cuisine/period. Chicken & dumpling dishes are traditionally associated with the American 
South. Curiously? Early cookbooks (pre-1930s) do not offer recipes for this particular combination. Maybe it's one of those stealth dishes that claimed fame after 
the fact. Not so unusual in the food world. General notes below:


<p>
"Recipes for chicken and dumplings are virtually nonexistent in the earliest Southern cookbooks. The dish did, however, eventually become somewhat of a mainstay 
in the Southern diet, particularly in rural areas. Often the broth (which sometimes has milk added) is thickened by flour. Although some cooks may use chicken 
back or other parts exclusively, most recipes call for a whole bird that is simmered in water, usually with the addition of aromatic vegetables. For simple family 
meals, the cooked meat might be left on the bones and served in pieces....Southern dumplings can be made of flour, cornmeal, or potatoes either made  into a 
loose, wet batter or into a firmer, biscuit-like dough rolled thinly and cut into strips. Whatever their form and texture, dumplings are always cooked in a simmering
 broth. (Dumplings are colloquially referred to as 'slicks' or 'slickums' by some, due to their rather slippery---but not unappetizing---texture.)"<br>

Food historians generally agree the practice of ingesting gold (and silver) originated in the Indian subcontinent. It spread
to China, then across the Middle East to Europe.    
Gold's culinary applications descend from ancient medicinal prescriptions & alchemist wares. Gold was also employed as a 
food colorant, decoration,
and obvious display of wealth. <a href="foodcakes.html#dragee">Silver dragees</a> have been 
decorating holiday cookies & wedding cakes from the 20th century forwards. Today, edible gold leaf is readily available 
for purchase. Glittering traces of this element adorn cakes, candies, & salads.

<b>Eastern origins: decoration & medicinal applications</b><br>
"Embellishing foods with precious metals is a centuries-old tradition that originated in the East, where it served
as a symbol of hospitality and wealth, a garniture to honor the presence of a special guest at the table. 
Edible silver foil was widely used by Moguls in India to decorate elaborate preparations of sweemeats, kabobs, and
special rice dishes at court and was believed to be beneficial for the liver and to posess aphrodesiac qualities. In
Europe, a medieval banquet concluded with dramatic slabs of gilded gingerbread dotted with gold-brush cloves. Later, 
Elizabethan decorated their tables with piles of gold-spangled pomegranates, oranges, and grapes. To this day, 
Japanese artisans who gild screen gather up their skewings at the end of the workday, mix them in sake, and then sip
it all down as a thank-you to the gods for their creative powers."<br>

<b>The Chinese connection</b><br>
"Not surprisingly, the Eastern Zhou period was a period of which great scientific advances were amde in alchemy and
aurification...By the late Warring States period, mercury gilding had almost completely replaced gold foil as a means of altering the 
appearance of bronze. The search for man-made gold was spurred by popular ideas originating in the south that connected gold with
immortality, an exotic view traceable to India that led countless aristorcats to ingest gold in every conceivable form."<br>

"Gold and silver leaf are both used to decorate foods, and have so been used for many centuries. Surprisingly,
both are harmless as long as they are consumed as pure metals, though many silver compounds are
poisonous. The are on the EC list of approved colourings, having the numbers E175 and E174. Usually they
are applied in the form of very thin sheets known as gold or silver leaf. Narrow ribbons and powder are also
sold. They are tasteless and odorless...In An Ordinance of Pottage, an edition of the 15th-century culinary
recipes in the Beinecke MS 163, there is a recipe (138) in which a sweet pie is ornamented with blanched
walnuts, wetted with saffron water, and impaled on a pin or needle for ease in handling. The needle is held in
one hand and gold foil is laid on  with that other hand with a thyng made therfore, & blow theron esyly with thy
mouth, & that shall make thy gold to abyde. & and so thru may gylt them over, and florich thy bakyn meat
therewith.' This is a precise description of how to use goldleaf, for if it is touched before it is fixed it will cling to
the fingers and cannot be removed intact...Axioms and quotations warn us that appearances can be
deceptive and all that glistens or shyneth is not gold, and the enticing gold of gingergbread on sale at fairs could
not have been genuine for the high price would have ensured a restricted sale...Elizabeth Raffald (1782)
describes her Gilded Fish in Jelly...Silver leaf is used in India (under the name vark or varaq) to decorate
various foods, especially in Moghul cuisine...Scraps of silver (or gold) leaf may sometimes be seen at Indian
and Pakistani weddings, tossed casually on heaps of rice or wrapped around cakes."<br>

"Another practice, similar to colouring food, was to cover a dish in gold or silver foil. One dish in the third
course was described as 'pety chek in bolyen' (that is small chicks in bullion, or gold foil). Other recipes are
known in which this occurs. In one case a pig was stuffed with a cock, which was itself stuffed with a mixture of
pine nuts and sugar, and the whole roasted. It was then coloured with eggs, saffron, and gold and silver foil."<br>

"...the practice dates from the Middle Ages and was quite common in Renaissance Italy. Did you
know that Galeazzo Visconti served an entire calf wrapped in a thin layer of gold at the wedding of
his daughter Violante in 1386? They were serving ostrich meat covered in gold in Venice in 1561.
Gilded foods were so ubiquitous in Padua in the 16th century that authorities suggested serving no
more than two courses in gold per feast. Martha Bayless, an English professor and director of the
medieval studies program at the University of Oregon (who is teaching a course titled "The Medieval
Feast in Theory and Practice"), says Neuberg is correct. In fact, Middle Age strivers viewed their
holiday food fests as a "mini-paradise" of peace and abundance, a temporary reprieve from a world of
uncertainty, hunger and war. The medieval fable about the Land of Cockayne is in part a food fetish
fantasy -- about a place where cooked geese fly over rivers of wine. And yes, gold was employed,
Bayless says, to dress up the food and create a sense of awe and bounty. "It is valuable and light and
attractive and shiny," Bayless says. For the rich who hosted the feasts, to celebrate weddings or
coronations, the use of gold "shows how much you can provide." The feasts, which could exceed 40
courses, were designed to overwhelm. That was the point."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>English trifle</b></font><br>
Food historians generally agree that classic English trifles are products of the Renaissance.
Related foods are medieval fools and (in very recent times) <a href="foodfaq1.html#tiramisu">tiramisu</a>.
The <i>Oxford English
Dictionary</i> traces the trifle (as it relates to food) in printed English texts to 1598 and defines it
thusly: "A dish composed of cream boiled with various ingredients. Obs. A light confection of
sponge-cake or the like, esp. flavoured with wine or spirit, and served with custard and whipped
cream." Related recipes? <a href="foodfaq1.html#zuppa">Zuppa Inglese</a> & <a href="foodcakes.html#italiancreamcake">Italian Cream Cake</a>.

"Trifle: a traditional English sweet or dessert. The essential ingredients are sponge cake soaked in
sherry or white wine, rich custard, fruit or jam, and whipped cream, layered in a glass dish in that
order. The cream is often decorated with, for example, slivers of almond, glace cherries, angelica. 
     The word trifle derives from the Middle English  trufl which in turn came from the Old
French  trufe (or truffle), meaning something of little importance. Originally, in the late 16th
century, the culinary meaning of the word trifle was  a dish composed of cream boiled with
various ingredients...The first known recipe entitled trifle was in <i>The Good Hyswife's
Jewell</i>,
1596 by T. Dawson, and there were many such recipes in the 17th century, including a  Triffel
from the great cookery writer Robert May (1685), but these were little more than spiced and
sweetened cream, latterly thickened by renneting. It was not until the mid-18th century that something like the modern trifle began to emerge. Biscuits wetted with wine were then in place at
the bottom of the bowl, and custard was on top of them, while the topmost layer could be
achieved by pouring whipped syllabub froth over all. When this froth was replaced by plain
whipped cream, the process of evolution was virtually complete."<br>
---<i>The Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford]
1999 (p. 805)
<p>
"In Elizabethan times trifles were simply cream warmed through and flavoured with sugar, ginger,
etc., but
gradually, in successive recipes, we find them being thickened up by boiling and adding rennet,
enlivened
by additional ingredients such as crushed macaroons, and decorated on top with comfits, until by
the mid-eighteenth century they are very much as we would recognize them today. Hannah Glasse
in the 1755
edition of her Art of Cookery gives a recipe for a 'Grand Trifle' which includes naples biscuits,
ratafias, and
macaroons soaked in sack with custard poured over them and topped with syllabub, and which
she
describes as 'fit to go to the King's table, if well made...'. Trifles were indeed very popular in the
eighteenth
century, and there were several different variants...The original meaning of the word in medieval
English
was 'an inconsequential or insubstantial tale, told either to amuse or to deceive', but it was not
long before
this broadened out to 'a thing or matter of little importance', from which the dish took its name.
The
immediate source of the word was Old French truffle, a variant of truffe, meaning 'deceit,
trickery', but
where this came from is not clear; there may be some connection with truffle the fungus, though
this has
never been established for certain...The French call trifle creme anglaise."<br>

"Among the creamy dishes of the Tudor and Stuart period were trifles, fools and white pots. An
Elizabethan trifle was made thus:  Take a pint of thick cream, and season it with sugar and ginger,
and rosewater, so stir it as you would then have it, and lake it luke warm in a dish on a
chafingdish and coals, and after put it into a silver piece or bowl, and so service it to the board.
In later recipes the cream was boiled and lightly renneted to make it thicker and  when you serve
it in, strew on some French comfits. By 1751 trifle was being made with broken Naples biscuits,
macaroons and ratafia cakes wetted with sack at the bottom of the bowl, good boiled custard in
the middle, and  then put a syllabub over tha'. Subsequent recipes replaced the syllabub with
whipped cream, milled in a chocolate mill; and the modern trifle was established."<br>

pour in a part of the cream, lay the remainder of the macaroons upon it, add the rest of the cream, and ornament it with candied citorn

"Trifle.</b><br>
This is a compound of syllabub and sweetmeats. Line the bottom of the glass trifle-dish with sponge biscuits stuck with 
blanched almonds; moisten them with sweet wine, or with sherry and sugar. Over these lay a dozen ratafia cakes dipped in 
noyeau. Intersperse with these some thin slices of citron and orange-peel, and distribute over these pieces of apricot and raspberry jam and
currant jelly. Pour over these a few spoonfuls of the liquor of the syllabub. The next layer should consist of tartlet  
cream of about the thickness of an inch, over  which grate some nutmeg, and strew a little powdered cinnamon, together with a
small quantity of lemon-peel, and some powdered loaf-sguar. Lastly, take the whipped froth from the sieve, and put it on the top as abundantly
as the dish will contain. To give it a pleasing appearance, strew various coloured comfits over the froth. The tartlet cream to
form one of the layers may be made as followes:--Mix together half a pint of cream and the same quantitiy of milk; put into it a 
piece of fresh lemon or Seville orange-peel, and a little cinammon, and sweeten with loaf sugar. Let these ingredients boil
about ten minues. Have ready prepared in another pan the yolks of six eggs well-beaten up with a heaped tea-spoonful of fine flour; to
these gradually strain the boiled ingredients, and then whisk them well together over a gentle fire, so that they may
acquire the proper consistence without curdling. If you are deficient of cream, milk only may be employed, but in that case
a litle more flour will be required."

Karen Hess, food historian, explains the connection between fools and trifles:
"The oldest meaning of fool in English cookery, long since obsolete, is a custard dish. There is
some dispute over the derivation of the word; a cook might opt for French fouler (to press or
crush) given the present composition of the dish, but OED [Oxford English Dictionary] spurns
this construction and agrees with those who link it with trifle, or a bit of foolishness. The earliest
citation, from Florio, 1598, "a kinde of clouted cream called a fool or a trifle in English," is
compelling....In later English cookery, the sort of dish described in our recipe above [To Make a
Fool] came to be known as a trifle, nowadays typically made of stale sponge cake, custard sauce,
and sherry...."<br>

"Fines herbes is the French term for a mixture of chopped fresh herbs used in cooking. The standard elements of the mix are parsley, chives, tarragon, and chervil, but it is common to find others
included, such as thyme or rosemary. Alexis Soyer, the French chef who worked in England and had a cruicial influence on Victorian cookery, may have introduced the concept of 
fines herbs to the British, and by by the mid-nineteenth century it was well enough established for Mrs. Beeton to give a recipe for whitings aux fines herbes in her
Book of Household Management (1861) (she does not specify which herbs to use). But probably its most familiar application in Britian is to flavour the omelete aux 
fines herbes.)"<br>

"Fines herbes the convenient French term for a mixture of chopped fresh herbs used in cooking. A minimalist interpretation would be parsley with any (or all) of: 
chervil, tarragon, chives. However, the number of different herbs to be used is far from fixed; and the range includes thyme, rosemary, burnet, and marjoram. The mixture is used
to flavour meat, fish, and salads, and (most common in Britian) to flavour omelettes."<br>

article, chop all the trimmings very fine; squeeze the water out of them, in the corner of the dish. Chop the same quantity of parsley, previously washed and dried
in a cloth; add about half the quantity of chopped shalot, also well washed and drained; say about 2 oz. of shalot to 4 oz of mushrooms and 4 oz. of parsley. Put, in a stewpan,

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Flower water (rose & orange)</b></font><br>

Both Rose Water and Orange Flower Water were used to flavor foods from Medieval times forward. 
Originating in Arab cuisine, flavors migrated to Europe during Crusader times. Colonial Americans cooked what they knew 
from home, introducing flower waters to the New World. Advances in flavoring/food technology encouraged the widespread use
 of vanilla. Eventually, the old flower waters were abandoned. Today most people have never heard of flower waters. They 
are surprised to learn how old they are!
<p>
<b>Old World use</b><br>
"The Ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans managed to extract fragrance from the rose 
by steeping petals in water, oil, or alcohol. And it is probably that the technique of 
distillation of rosewater evolved in the 3rd and 4th centuries AD in Mesopotamia. By the 
9th century Persia was distilling rosewater on a large scale. It is, however, usual to name 
Avicenna, the famous physician of the 10th century, as being the person who discovered 
rosewater. It was in his time that the use of rosewater as a flavoring for food came into 
vogue in the lavish and sumptuous cuisine of the Arabs. It was used to flavor a variety of 
dishes and was even sprayed over the surface of the cooking pot. The use of rosewater 
spread to Europe via the Crusaders. It was...popular in medieval England. Rosewater was 
also a favourite flavouring of the Ottoman Turks and they in turn introduced it to 
Bulgaria, where the Valley of the Roses at Kazanluk is famous for its production of 
rosewater, oil of roses, rose-petal jams, and preserves...Rosewater is still used extensively 
all over the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East." <br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 
(p. 673) 
<p>
"Neither rose water nor citrus appears in any of the Greco-Roman recipes compiled by Apicius. The Arabs brought the lemon and 
orange to Spain perhaps by the ninth century, and to Sicily in the tenth...The Arabs used citrus juices in their cooking, but less 
frequently than rose water. Rose water was sent to the Magreb, Spain, Yemen, India, and China from such centers as Shiraz, and 
Damascus vied for importance as a major distributor by the thirteenth century." <br>

<b>North American use</b><br>
"Rose Water. Introduced to Europe from Arab cuisine by the crusaders in such dishes as marzipan and Turkish delight, rose water is the 
distillate of rose petals, most famously from the damask rose. Substitutes for the distillate have been made by adding attar of 
rose, which is the oil extracted from crushed roses, to water. Colonial Americans used rose water as a flavoring, similar in 
purpose to the later-introduced vanilla, in confectionery and dessert recipes inherited from Europe and in syrups used to 
flavor beverages. Rose water also flavored savories, such as chicken pies and creamed spinach. Some housewives, even as late 
as the 1880s, distilled their own. Others purchased it, perhaps as 'Double Distilled Damask Rose Water' from the Shakers, a 
religious sect respected for the quality and purity of their products and for their rose water apple pie. Contemporary us is most common 
in cuisines of Middle Eastern, Indian, or Sephardic heritage, flavoring desserts and drinks, such as baklava, sorbets 
and lassi. Rose water is sometimes used interchangeably with orange flower water and may be sprinkled on fresh fruits."<br>

"Orange Flower Water, also called orange blossom water, is a flavoring distilled from the flowers of sour orange trees, such as 
Seville and bergamot, usually as a condensed-steam by-product of distilling oil, known as neroli. It is made primarily in 
Lebanon and France. In the nineteenth century, orange flower water flavored many English desserts. It migrated in cake and custard 
recipes and in calillaire, a sugar syrup. Either orange flower water or rose water was a key ingredient in oregat, originally a 
beverage and later a syrup used to sweeten other beverages." <br>
---<i>ibid</i> (p. 215)

"The most beloved of all flowers was the rose (genus Rosa). The recipe of the earliest 
English manuscripts read almost like Arab recipes of the same period; rose petals and 
rose water in some of the most surprising dishes, and rose water continued in sweet 
dishes until it was displaced by vanilla in, roughly, the early part of the nineteenth 
century. Gerard says: "The distilled water of Roses is good for the strengthening of the 
heart, and refreshing of the spirits, and likewise for all things that require a gentle 
cooling. The same being put in junketting dishes, cakes, sauces, and many other pleasant 
things, giveth a fine and delectable taste."<br>

Martha Washington's recipe "To Make Mint Cakes" (after dinner mints) employs orange flower water. Ms. Hess notes: 
"This is the only use of orange-flower water in the manuscript, and this accurately reflect the situation in English cookbooks. Rose 
water appears in perhaps a quarter of all the recipes, virtually all the sweet dishes aside from preserved fruits. The 
reason, of course, is largely one of climate; roses thrive in England while the orange tree does not." (p. 309-309)

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Fondue</b></font><br>
Food historians generally agree [cheese] fondue began in Switzerland sometime in the early 19th century. 
There is no specific chef, place, or restaurant credited for "inventing" this dish. 
Simple regional ingredients suggest it was a peasant meal. This is perhaps confirmed by
the fact that Ude, Gouffe and Escoffier do not include recipes for cheese fondue in their
master works. Escoffier (1903) does, however, include recipes for tomato fondue (a tomato
reduction) and Fondus au Parmesean. The latter recipe is described as having nothing to do with
Swiss Fondue au Fromage.

Culinary evidence confirms recipes for fondue evolved according to place and taste.

<a href="foodfaq1.html#fonduta">Italian</a> and <a href="foodfaq1.html#americanfondue">American</a> cooks have skillfully tweaked the

<b>What exactly is "fondue?"</b><br>
"Fondue, the French word for  'melted', is the name of a Swiss dish made of melted cheese...There
are many recipes for cheese fondue, including that given by Brillat-Savarin (1826) which has been
condemned by Swiss authorities as being for scambled eggs with cheese rather than true fondue.
Eggs do not appear in classic Swiss recipes. Most Swiss would agree that a proper fondue is
made with a blend of cheeses--of gruyere, emmental, and a softer local cheese such as raclette or
appenzell--white wine, a little kirsch, a spoonful of flour to prevent curdling, salt, pepper, nutmeg,
and nothing else. Fonduta, the Italian version of fondue, is made with fontina cheese...There is
also a similar Dutch dish called kaasdoop (cheese dip)."<br>

href="http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/b/b85p/part34.html#201">fondue description and recipe</a> c. 1826 is
unanimously regarded by fondue connosieurs as incorrect. Julia Child's <a href="http://foodtimeline.org/childfondue">French fondue</a> (meant for
pastry filling) includes eggs and was not intended for bread dipping. Early 20th century USA fondues resembled cheese 
souffles. Clearly there is not one, but several different dishes called "fondue." We wonder: does dipping tortillas in 
warm queso sauce qualify as Mexican fondue? Fascinating!

<b>Swiss fondue</b><br>
Even among Swiss, there are several recipes for "classic" cheese fondue. Modern recipe, regional variations, and social customs:
<blockquote>
<b>Cheese Fondue</b><br>
Basic Recipe<br>
600 g (21 oz) shredded cheese (1/2 Gruyere, 1/2 Emmentaler), 1 garlic clove, 3 dl (1 1/4 C) dry white wine, 3 tsp cornstarch, 
3 small glasses kirsch, ground pepper, nutmeg<br>
Rub a heavy saucepan or heat proof clay fondue pot (Caquelon) with the split garlic clove. Dissolve the cornstarch in the kirsch.
Put the cheese and wine into thepan and slowly bring to a boil, stirring constantly. When the cheese is completely melted, add the
kirsch and cornstarch mixture, stirring vigourously. Continue to cook. Season with pepper and nutmeg. Serve over an alcohol
lamp. The cooking should continue on low heat. Stir constantly with small pieces of bread speared on a fondue fork. There are
several varietries of fondue:<br>
In the Canton of Vaud, fondue is prepared with Gruyere cheese only, but at varying stages of ripeness. Sometimes it is mixed with
cheese from the Jura.<br.
In the canton of Fribourg, fondue is either served Moite-Moite (half/half), meaning 300 g (10 1/2 oz) Fribourg Vacherin and 300 g
(10 1/2 oz) Gruyere, or only with Vacherin but without wine. The latter version calls for a very ripe Vacherin. The cheese is melted
at low heat with 1 dl (1/3 C) hot water. The fondue should not boil. It is served in fondue pot over a candcle (not alcohol-)
burner.<br>
In the Jura, the fondue is made up of 1/2 Jura cheese and enhanced with 1-2 challots per person. The challots are eaten last.<br>
In Geneva three kinds of cheese are used: Gruyere, Emmentaler and Vaudois cheese. Then, sauteed chopped morsels (fresh or dried and 
pre-soaked) or diced tomatoes are added.<br>
Fondue is usually eaten with bite-sized pieces of crusty bread speared on a fondue fork. One can also, however, use small potatoes or
potato slices. Fondue aficionados dunk their bread in kirsch before dipping it into the cheese. And don't forget: whoever loses his bread in the 
pan must pay for a round of beer or a bottle of wine. If it happens to a lady she must kiss the man sitting next to her. On
the whole, howevr, the former is more popular."<br>

"Fondue (Fondue au Fromage).
A regional specialty of the Franche-Comte and of the Swiss Romande, the fondue has variations in both the way it is made and the cheeses used
in its confection. The essential equipment is always a pan-shaped casserole made of earthenware, enameled steel, or special
heatproof glass. Also, a wooden fork and a heater with an adjustable flame: while you are eating it, a fondue should maintian a
temperature close to boiling, but it is essential that too much of a crust does not form on the bottom of the pan. For some people, 
a fondue is a meal in itslef, and for others it would be a substantial entree. We give here a simple recipe of easy 
execution...If the rustic style of serving does not appeal, follow the Valaisanne fashion and serve potatoes in their skins 
with the fondue. Each guest peels and cuts these into slices on a heated plate, and then a heated ladle is used to pour over a portion
of fondue. A successful fondue should have the consistency of a perfectly smooth creme anglaise. Note the local custom of the coup
du milieu ('the midway shot'), a liqueur glass of kirsch served, as its name indicates, when about half the fondue has been
consumed."<br>

<b>Fondue gruyerienne au vacherin.</b><br>
Voici la recette de la vrai fondue,--de la fondue fribourgeoise et gruyerienne, qui est un mets de
fete, un plat de regalade dans son pays d'origine. Brillat-Savarin donne la recette d'une fondue au
fromage qui est toute differente, et qui ne saurait etre appreciee des gourmets et des gourmands
comme cell ci:<br>
Prenez un kilogramme de vacherin frais et blanc; coupez-le en petits cubes dans une marmite de
terre ou de tole emaillee, et protez le tout sur un feu doux.
Surveillez, sans vous laisser distraire par la fumee ordorante que degage le vacherin fondant, et
remuez continuellement avec une fouchette de bois neuve, jusqu'a ce que la masse, qui present
alors l'aspect et la consistance d'une creme epaisse et filante, commence a bouillonner.
A ce moment precis, retirez du feu et ajoutez du poivre (mais pas de sel). Puis servez sur un
rechaud la marmite elle-meme ou s'est operee la fondue, et mange bien chaud. 
Les petits cubes de pain frais, qui, piques a la fourchette, sont plonges et retournes dans la
marmite, placee au milieu de la table; une fois bien enrobe dans la fourchette, sont la table; une
fois bien enrobe dans la creme fumante, chaque petit fragment de pain est ressorti au bout de la
fourchette et savore deliciusement entre deux verres de vin blanc, Yvorne ou Villeneuve. De cette
facon la fondue reste bien au chaud dans le reciepient meme ou elle s'est fabriquee, et ne subit pas
de transvasement. Un kilogramme de vacherin suffit pour rassasier de fondue quatre personnes.
C'est un plat extremement nourrissant et trais sain. Et en effet, le vacherin qui en est la matiere
premiere se fait absolutment comme le fromage de Gruyere--si ce n'est que pour celui-ci, le lait
est chauffe a un degree superieur. Le vacherin a meme un gros avantage sur le fromage de
Gruyere: it contient tout le lait (creme, petit-lait, etc.), tandis que, au course de al fabrication du
fromage, de nombreuz accessoires sont elimines (petit-lait, serac, etc.). Le vacherin de fabrique
dans la Suisse francaise, surtout dans la Gruyere; il s'expedier par pieces de 5 a 15 kilogrammes,
et vaut de 1 fr. 40 a 1 fr. 60 le kilogramme. Victor Tissot."<br>

<b>Modern American fondue</b><br>
Traditional <href="#swissfondue">Swiss fondue</a> was embraced by trendy USA cooks in the 1950s-1970s. The idea of 
tableside cooking, especially with cheese, was not new. Think: 1920s chafing dish parties serving 
cheesy hot table top <a href="foodfaq1.html#rabbit">Welsh rabbit</a> (aka rarebit) and English Monkey on toast points.
Early 20th century USA Fondue recipes were fell into one of two categories: baked breadcrumb cheese souffles or chafing 
dish sauces poured over toast. The earliset recipe we have for Swiss-style fondue published USA cookbook is from 1941. 
After WWII, fondue recipes in USA cookbooks slowly took hold. Most came from French sources. 
<p>
Print evidence suggests "average" Americans were not familiar with Swiss-style fondue and its curious customs. Early 
recipes offered copious notes describing specialized equipment and serving rituals. Most alarmingly? Warnings against
drinking ice-cold beverages while consuming cheese fondue because hot cheese hardens would "harden" in the stomach causing
discomfort. While trendy authors stated special fondue
pots and long forks were essential, others assured home cooks it was okay to adapt and improvise. Our favorite notes come from
<a href="foodfaq1.html#fondue101">Roy Andries de Groot</a> c. 1966. Before long, colorful glazed fondue pots with matching
forks were standard gifts at bridal showers and weddings. The "canned heat" was typically Sterno brand. Why did this particular
 spread like wildfire? Simple. The ingredients were inexpensive and familiar; the equipment novel and within reach. Grandmother's

Swiss Cheese Fondue</b><br>
Four our family of 4<br>
The fun of a fondue is its <i>gemutlichkeit</i>. It's hard to be formal at dinner while eating from a communal dish. The fondue
is prepared in a casserole (ceramic or iron), which comes to the table boiling hot and is kept gently bubbling on a spirit
stove, a chafing dish, or an adjustable eletric hot plate. Each diner is armed with a long-handled fork on which he impales pieces of bread to
soak in the fondue. The trick is to fish up a thick crust of cheese without losing the bread.<br>
<i>Check Staples:</i><br>
Aromatics: crystal salt, freshly ground black pepper, MSG, garlic (2 or 3 cloves, to taste), freshly ground nutmeg<br>
Granulated instantized flour (about 3 Tbs.)<br>
Swiss kirsch liqueur (2 oz)<br>
<i>Shopping list:</i><br>
Swiss Emmenthaler cheese (1/2 lb.)<br>
Swiss Gruyere cheese (1/2 lb.)<br>
Swiss Neufchatel dry white wine (1 bottle)<br>
French Conac (1 1/2 oz.)<br>
French Martinique rhum (1 1/2 oz.)<br>
French bread (2 long loaves)<br>
<i>About 40 minutes before serving</i> Arrange the spirit stove, chafing dish, or electric hot plate on a heatproof board
in the middle of the dining table, within reach of each diner. Coarsely grate the two cheeses and lightly mix them in a bowl with the 3 tablespoons
of flour. Peel and very finely chop the garlic and spread it inside the casserole. Put in 1 pint of the white wine and heat it almost 
to boiling. When small air bubbles start to rise imtermittently, begin adding large spoonfuls of cheese mix, carefully stirring 
with a wooden fork until each lot is melted before dripping in the next. Scrape bottom to avoid sticking. Break up lumps and, above
all, stir gently to avild having cheese become stringy. When mixture becomes quite thick, adjust heat to maintain gentle
bubbling. Season to taste with salt, pepper, MSG, and a couple of grinds of nutmeg. Do not stop stirring with the wooden fork for
even a moment. Add the 2 ounces of kirsch, the 1 1/2 ounces of Cognac, and the 1 1/2 ounces of rhum. Keep stirring. Meanwhile a second
person starts the heater on the dining table and begins to cut the bread into 3/4-inch-thick slices; these are then quartered.
Place before each diner a plate with about a dozen or so of these bread triangles and a long-handled fork. Bring casserole from kitchen
 and set it on the dining-table heater, adjusting temperature so that fondue contrinues to bubble gently. The eating begins at
once.<br>
<a name="fondue101"">
<i>How to Avoid Losing the Bread and Messing up the Table</i><br>
Impale a piece of bread on the fork, passing the points through the white crumb first, then firmly embedding them in the crust. 
Each diner in turn sticks his bread into the fondue, where is first duty is to continue the stirring, first at the top and then,
more importantly, scraping the thicker cheese that is settling on the bottom. As the bread is lifted from the fondue it is 
twisted until it stop dripping, then quickly brought over the diner's plate, which is held out to meet it, and allowed to cool
for a second or two. Still bubbling, the fondue gradually thickens and, if neeed, a little more heated white wine can be 
stirred in. Finally all that is left is a firm crust of cheese on the bottom of the casserole. The heat is turned off, the crust 
scraped off with a knife, and the pieces are divided among the diners, as a special last delicacy. It is crisp and crackly.
One essential of a fondue is that no ice-cold drinks be served with it; they would harden the cheese in the stomach and 
cause indigestion. Hot tea or coffee are excellent."<br>

<b>Italian Fonduta</b><br>
"White truffles of Piedmont go into many of the region's dishes, including what is perhaps its best known specialty, fonduta. 
This is an Alpine melted cheese dish, found also in the French and Swiss Alps. Piedmont is good cheese country...For [fonduta]
 Piedmont uses fontina, which comes from the Valle d'Aosta, taking its name from Mount Fontin, at Quart. It is a cheese of
 respectable age.
As long ago as 1477 Panteleone di Confienza wrote in his Summa lacticinorum: 'Vallis Augusta casei boni sunt' ('in the Valle 
d'Aosta the cheeses are good'). The rich fatty orange fontina, which comes in great cartwheels, is made with infinite paines, but
the finishing touch comes from a process with which human skill has little to do--its aging in well-aired stone buildings nearly
10,000 feet up. If fonduta is related to the French and Swiss fondues, it nevertheless has highly individual characteristics. 
The melted cheese which is the base for all three is mixed in fonduta with butter, milk and beaten egg yolks, none of which
appear in the French and Swiss dishes, and is sprinkled liberally with white pepper. Swiss fondue uses white wine and kirsch; French practice on
alcoholic additions varies; but fonduta uses none at all. Finally, fonduta is crowned with a layer of white truffles sliced
paper-thin, a touch which neither France nor Switzerland can match. Both in France and Swizerland, the bowl of fondue is 
usually placed bubbling over  aheater in the middle of the table; the diners spear cubes of bread on their forks, plunge
them in the common pot and tworl th bread around to coat it with the melted cheese, and then pop the result into their
mouths, repeating the process ad infinitum. In Piedmont the fonduta, which has the consistency of a thick cream, is served in 
individual plates, like soup, or may be poured over slabs of polenta."<br>

dish, which crossed the order during the years of the Risorgimento, has since become part of Piemontese tradition. Shaving

Unlke Savarin, I don not consider fondue an important dish, as it seems to me it may only be served as an appetizer for lunch or

80 grams (about 2-2/3 ounces) of butter<br>
4 egg yolks<br.
milk, as much as needed<br>
Fontina is a cheese not unlike Gruyere, but somewhat fattier. Cut the Fontina into little cubes and soak in milk for two
hours. Put the butter in a saucepan on the fire, and when it has begain to color, add the Fontina, but only two tablespoons of the mlk
in which it has been soaking. Stirring constanty with a mixing spoon, do not allow it to come to a boil. When the cheese has
completely melted, remove from the burner and add the egg yolks. Put back on the burner for a short while, still stirring. In winter,
pour the cacimperio into a hot bowl. If it has turned out well, it should be neither grainy or stringy. Instead it should look like
heavy cream. In Turin, I have seen fondue served with a top layer of paper-thin slices of raw white truffles."<br>

<b>Bagna cauda</b><br>

"Bagna Cauda: Hot bath of olive oil, anchovies and garlic. When the air in the vine-covered hills of Piedmont was thick with the aroma of newly made wine, workers once used to gather to share 
a pot of bagna cauda set over heat in the middle of the table. They would dip crisp raw autumn vegetables into the steamy garlicky mixture of oil, butter, and anchovies. 
This rustic dish is part of an authentic gastronomic tradition persisting to this day. Centuries ago feudal statutes required that a certain quantity of garlic be grown by each 
landowner, who was then taxed on it...The oil for the bagna cauda was originally either hazelnut or walnut oil, but a light Ligurian olive oil would be just right today. Bagna cauda is 
eaten all winter long these days, usually as a first course served in individual pans. When the dip is almost gone, it is a tradition to break an egg or two into the dish and scramble 
it over low heat." <br>
---<i>Celebrating Italy</i>, Carol Field [Harper Perennial] 1990, 1997 (p. 205)<br>

<p>
"Uniquely Piedmontese is bagna cauda (bagna caoda in dialect), which means 'hot bath.' I have never encountered it anywhere else in Italy. Perhaps you have to be born in 
Piedmont to be able to make it successfully; a Milanese cook told me he had tried to produce it, but always wound up with slimy thin unappetizing liquid. Yet it seems simple enough. You 
heat olive oil and butter, about a quarter more butter than oil by weight, together with a generous amount of chopped garlic, in a saucepan, without browning the garlic. When they are well combined, 
the saucepan is take off the fire and finely chopped anchovy is stirred into it, along with a bit of salt. The last step is to add thinly sliced white truffles. It is usually placed on the table 
in little individual bowls over heaters, to keep it hot, particularly important since the vegetables with are dipped in it before being conveyed to the mouth are cold and raw. In 
Piedmont, the favorite vegetable for bagna cauda is the local specialty, the cardoon, or edible thistle, but if cardoons are not at hand, you can make do with whatever is 
available--celery, fennel, bits of red or yellow peppers, cauliflower, coarsely chopped cabbage, artichokes, or strips of 
carrot, singly or in combination." <br>

<b>Beef fondue</b><br>
Food historians confirm people have been cooking small pieces of meat in hot oil for thousands of years. Asian

1970s. Like USA <a href="foodfaq1.html#americanfondue">cheese fondue</a>, early recipes include notes about the proper equipment
and special serving instructions required to achieve the meal. We wonder if beef fondue was 
introduced to boost sagging sales (what else to do with the fondue pot?) or forecasting the next trend in USA fancy housewares: the wok.
<p>
"In French the word <i>fondant</i> means melting, juicy, luscious--a most apt trio of adjectives to describe the many dishes
called fondues in which melted cheese plays a key role...a recent trend has developled also to cut small chunks of meat cooked in hot oil with similar equipment

This dish really needs a separate chapter. There is an ordered ritual for eating it and prescribed utensils and pots for

salad oil and kept piping hot over an alcohol flame. The group must be small enough to be within easy reach of the oil--not more
than 8 people per pot. A bowl of bite-sized pieces of very tender beef, such as sirloin or tenderloin (8 oz per person), and
a variety of sauces are the ingredeints. The guests, using the long handled fork, takes a piece of beef, places it in the boiling
oil, where it sizzles delightfully, and cooks it until it is done as much a he desires. He transfers it to his own plate, salts
and peppers it and then, using the second fork, dipes it in one of the sauces offered, such as those below."<br>

just under boiling. Turn heat down and keep just under boiling. When serving fondue, remove the cover and let each guest spear
the meat with his fondue fork and dip into hot oil for 10-20 seconds to cook. After cooking, the guest should remove his fork from
the pot and take the meat off with a regular dinner fork. The fondue fork is too hot to use for eating.The guest may then dip his
meat into any one of the sauces before eating. Recipes for different sauces are included in the last section of this booklet. 
After serving, let the oil cool so it may be saved for your next fondue party.

"Variations on the meat or beef fondues<br>
In the same way that you can make a number of variations with cheese fondue recipes, so you can vary from beef in the 'beef fondue.'
Try one or more of these beef alternatives, using the same cooking process as for 'Fondue Bourguignonne.'<br>
1. Chicken breasts: Cut into cubes, pat dry and cook as for beef.<br>
2. Marinated chicken: Combine 1/3 cup soy sauce, 1/4 dup dry sherry, 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger. Put cubed chicken into 
marinade, cover and chill one hour. Just before serving, drain well and dry with paper towels. Cook as with beef.<br.
3. Calves liver: Cube and cook as beef.<br>
4. Fish: Cut one pound slice (1/2 to 3/4 inches thick) salmon, halibut or swordfish into 1/4 X 2" strips. Dip into hot oil until 
cooked and lightly browned. Then dip into curry, tartar or seafood sauce.<br>
5. Shrimp: Use one pound shelled, de-veined, washed and
dried raw shrimp. Cook in hot oil until it turns pink. Use same sauces as for fish. For faster cooking, use precooked 
shrimp.<br>
For and elegant, variety-filled dinner, arrange several of these prepared foods on a platter and surround them with a variety
of appropriate sauces. All of this can be prepared in advance."<br>

<b>Chocolate fondue</b><br>
Chocolate fondue is mid-20th century with several claimants with regards to "invention." Early recipes are baked
dessert variations of "American-style" breadcrumb souffle also called <a href="foodfaq1.html#americanfondue">fondue</a>.
<p>
"In 1952
chef-owner Konrad Elgi of New York's Chalet Swiss restaurant made a fondue bourguignonne,
made with beef cubes cooked in hot oil, that became an overnight sensation that spread rapidly to
other restaurants. In the early 1960s Egli, who noticed that many of his diet-conscious customers
avoided his rich chocolate desserts, consulted with his public-relations agent, Beverly Allen, and
came up with a chocolate fondue (introduced on July 4, 1964) into which one dipped pieces of
cake, fruit, or cream-puff pastry--a variation completely unknown in Switzerland but one that
became popular even there within the last few years."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New
York] 1999 (p. 130).
<p>
We can confirm Chocolate fondue was on NYC's Suisse Chalet menu in the 1980s: ("Restaurants: Chalet Suisse," Mimi Sheraton, <i>
New York Times</i>, December 19, 1980 (p. C22)"Chocolate fondue--a tiny ceramic casserole of silky chocolate kept hot over a burner
can be dipped into with bits fo fruit or tiny fluted profiterolles." and "Chalet Suisse...Desserts, Chocolate Fondue for Two $10.00," 
---display ad, <i>New York Times</i>, February 10, 1985 (p. 72)). Before then, all we're finding are references to cheese and beef  fondues. We are still looking for print evidence confirming the 1964 Konrad Elgi's 1964 claim 
offered by Mr. Mariani. Popular 1970s/80s USA chocolate maven and cookbook author Maida Heatter also credits NYC Chalet 
Suisse but does not mention chef or date.  
<p>
Our survey of USA newspapers confirms recipes titled "Chocolate Fondue"
existed from the 1930s forward. Most were the standard baked breadcrumb souffle version. The earliest print reference we find 
for chocolate fondue meaning fork-dipping small edible items into a communal pot of warm creamy sauce is from 1966. Articles confirm
this food was introduced at the National Fancy Food and Confection show in September of that year. Recipes proliferated 
the following month. Special chocolate fondue pots were agressively promoted by upscale housewares stores soon thereafter.

"Chocolate Fondue</b><br>
Fondue is French for melted; a fondue is a melted food. Originally it was a melted cheese dish served with chunks of bread. It
is probably the most popular dish from Switzterland. The recipe has come a long way to this chocolate version--a fun dessert, 
created at the Chalet Suisse restaurant in New York City. It is especially good for a casual party. To serve it properly ytou need a
fondue pot or some other way of keeping the chocolate warm. And it must be within comfortable reach of all the guests; on a 
very long table you need more than one fondue pot. (It is most cozy to serve this on a round tables with a lazy Susan in the middle.) You will
serve the warm chocolate mixture and an assortment (few or many--it's up to you) of dunkable foods. The dunkables may be on one 
large platter, or many small ones, or each guest can be served a plate with an assortment. Most commonly they are well-drained
pineapple chunks which may be fresh, canned, or frozen and thawed. (Some fonduers rave about the delicious quality of frozen
pineapple chunks dipped in the warm chocolate. If you want to try that, the pineapple, which may be fresh, canned, or 
froen and thawed, should be well drained. Each chunk should have a toothpick stuck in it to lift it with. The pieces should
be frozen--not touching each other--on a foil-covered tray.) Fresh strawberries are wonderful. So are orange sections, apple
wedges, banana chunks, ladyfingers, graham crackers, chunks of angel food or pound cake. And marshmallows, candied orange and
grapefruit peel. Dried figs, dried apricots, pitted dried prunes and dates. And most especially (seriously, these are divine), 
saltines, pretzels, and plain salted but unflavored matzohs. Long-handled fondue forks might or might not be necessary
depending on the dippers you serve. Some of them (saltines, pretzels, graham crackers) are finger-food. But some dried fruits, 
marshmallows, or squares of ound cake will require a fondue fork for each person. I think it is best to make the chocolate
mxture in the kitchen and transfer it to the fondue pot just before serving. Fondue recipes are very flexible. You can vary the
chocolate and the liquors. Just remember to keep the mixture thick; it should coat the dunkable items heavily."

<a name="rabbit">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Welsh Rabbit</b></font><br>

The origin and evolution of Welsh Rabbit (aka Welsh Rarebit) differs according to one's point of view. Certainly, combinations of melted cheese and toasted bread have been
 enjoyed in several cultures and cuisines for thousands of years. The proceedings of this particular recipe hinges on political persuasion. 
<p>
"There is no evidence that the Welsh actually originated this dish of toasted cheese, although they have always had a reputation as cheese-lovers. A more likely 
derivation of the name is that Welsh in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was used as a patronizingly humorous epithet for any inferior grade or varitey of 
article, or for a substitute for the real thing...Welsh rabbit may therefore have started life as a dish resorted to when meat was not avialable. The first record of the
 word comes in John Byron's Literary Remains (1725): 'I did not eat of cold beef, but of Welsh rabbit and stewed cheese.' Although the term is often used simply
 for a slice of bread topped with cheese and put under the grill, the fully-fledged Welsh rabbit is a more complicated affiar, with several variations: the cheese
 (classically Cheddar or Double Gloucester...) can be mixed with butter or mustard, beer or wine, and it can be pre-melted and poured over the toast rather than 
grilled...Welsh rabbit has of course produced one of the great linguistic causes celebres of gastronomy with it genteel variant Welsh rarebit. There is little doubt that
 rabbit is the original form, and that rarebit (first recorded in 1785) is an attempt to folk-etymologize it--that is, to reinterpret the odd and inappropriate-sounding 
rabbit as something more fitting to the dish. Precisely how this took place is not clear; it has been speculated that rarebit was originally rearbit, that is, something 
eaten at the end of a meal, but there is no actual evidence for this. However that may be, the spurious rarebit has continued to be preferred up to the present day by
 those who apparently find honest-to-goodness rabbit slightly vulgar."<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 365)
<p>
"One thing which is not in doubt is Welsh fondness for cheese...The real problem is to find a plausible explanation for 'rabbit'. This difficulty has caused some 
authorities to declare that the term should really be 'rarebit', meaning a choice morsel. However, this does not work. The 'rabbit' version has been found in print as
 early as 1725, whereas 'welshe rarebit' was first recorded 60 years later...One piece of evidence of which the significance is difficult to discern is that Hannah
 Glasse (1747) gives four of these rabbit-cheese recipes: one for Scotch-Rabbit, one for Welch-Rabbit, and two for an English-Rabbit....Graham (1988) is one
 recent authority who should definitely be consulted about these mysteries, to which he devotes several pages. He remarks that: 'The French have always prized the
 Welsh rabbit. To the best of my knowledge, the dish first appeared in a French cookbook in 1814, when Antoine Beauvilliers published a recipe for wouelsch 
rabette (lapin gallois) in his L'Arte du cuisiner. But it really came into fashion when Anglomania was at its height around the turn of the century. In L'art des mets, 
published in 1959, the French gourmet Francis Amunategui remembers the atmosphere, decades earlier, at the then very British restaurant, The Criterion...
Anglophiles flocked there specially to order Welsh rabbit (by that time spelt correctly but usually abbreviated to le welsh) and wash it down with English ale in 
pewter mugs.'"<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2nd edition, 2006 (p. 844)<br>
[NOTE: See below for Hannah Glasse's recipes & others]
<p>
"The English, the Scots, and the Welsh do not always get along as well as most Americans might presume. The English traditionally scorned the Welsh as poor and
 not always trustworthy...When a new dish of melted cheese on toast was devised in the eighteenth century, it was jokingly called Welsh Rabbit, meaning that a 
Welshman, too poor to have meat, would call his cheese a rabbit. The alternative spelling, Welsh Rarebit, developed later and is imitative. If a Welshman had some 
cheeese, it would be a "rare bit."<br>
---<i>Rare Bits: The Unusual Origins of Popular Recipes</i>, Patricia Bunning Stevens [University of Ohio Press:Athens OH] 1998 (p. 124)
<p>
"I like the story that this dish, so much like fondue, got its name when Welsh wives, waiting anxiously, spied ther husbands or sons returning from a hunt 
empty-handed and set cheese before the fire to melt, as a substitute for a dinner of game. But my friend Paul Leyton,...has delved into the musty past to come up 
with an explanation of why Welsh Rabbit is sometimes called Welsh Rarebit. In England...there was a time when hors d'oeuvre were known as "forebits," because
 they were served in advance, and the characteristic savouries that come at a meal's end on British menus were called "rearbits"--hence the rarified pronunciation
 "rarebit.""<br>
---<i>The World of Cheese</i>, Evan Jones [Alfred A. Knopf:New York] 1970 (p. 158)
<p>
"Welsh Rabbit.--Let the Welsh tell their own take in the words of Lady Llanover:--"Welsh toasted cheese and the melted cheese of England are as different in the 
mode of preparation as is the cheese itself; the one being adapted to strong digestions, and the other being so easily digested that the Hermit frequently gave it to 
his invalid patients when they were recovering from illness. Cut a slice of the real Welsh cheese, made of sheep and cow's milk; toast it at the fire on both sides, 
but not so much as to drop; toast a piece of bread less than a quarter of an inch thick, to be quite crisp, and spread it very thinly with fresh cold butter on one side
 (it must not be saturated with butter); then lay the toasted cheese upon the bread, and serve immediately on a very hot plate. The butter on the toast can of course
 be omitted if not liked, and it is more frequently eaten without butter." It is quite intelligible that one cheese should be more wholesome than another; but that there
 is any marked difference in digestibility between cheese toasted and cheese melted or stewed, is difficult to believe. In case the wandering Englishman should 
suddenly feel in his travels of a sort of home-sickness, and desire to partake of Welsh rabbit, let it be known that in Viard's cookery book, which has a great
 reputation, the recipe is quite correctly given; and that on this authoritiy the said Englishman may safely call either for Wouelche Rabette or for Lapin Gallois."<br>
---<i>Kettner's Book of the Table</i>, E.S. Dallas,  facsimile 1877, preface by Derek Hudson, London edition [Centaur Press:London] 1968 (p. 486)
<p>
<b>Origin of this dish from the Welsh point of view:</b><p>
"The Welsh had an early passion for roasted, or toasted, cheese--caws pobi (caws cheese, pobi roasted), the forerunner of what became known eventually as 
Welsh Rarebit. From medieval times there are numerous references to it, and by Tudor times it had become something of a national dish. References to Welsh 
efforts to trade for the hard cheeses, especially of Cheddar, they coveted for roasting, confirm that the acidity of the soil in such a large part of Wales produced
 milk more suited to making soft cheeses of whole, or at least only semi-skimmed milk matured for a short time; though this is not to say that hard, well-matured,
 less rich cheeses were not made in some places. The poem in dialect by Dewi Emrys contains the line (in translation)'...and a hunk of a fine cheese', yet the soil in
 that part of west Wales is notoriously acid--hence the proliferation of lime kilns along that coast. But perhaps the cheese was made from ewes' milk, always  specified as an alternative to Cheddar for caws pobi because of its sharp-flavoured hardness."<br>
---<i>Traditional Food from Wales</i>, Bobby Freeman [Hippocrene:New York] 1997 (p. 31)
<p>
"The Welsh loved the hard English cheeses which they could not easily produce themselves because of the soft, acid soil which covered such a lard part of Wales. 
Those who lived in east Wale, in the old counties of Monmouth and Glamorgan, and perhaps parts of Breconshire and Radnorshire, too, drove their flocks of sheep
 to barter for the Cheddar cheese they wanted above oall for their saws pobi (literally toasted or roasted cheese) for which they had a passion since at least 
medieval times. In areas of Wales where Cheddar cheese was unavailable, ewes' milk cheese was used for caws pobi, as it had been form earliest times. Eventually
 this Welsh specialty became known as 'Welsh Rabbit'; finally, about the end of the 18th century we find the term 'rare-bit' coming into use. Nearly all the southern
 and western English counties had a 'rabbit', and all were on the same lines--either toasted or melted cheese, or a cheese sauce with the addition of beer and 
mustard, and sometimes onion. I think caws pobi was a part of Welsh fare much too early on, and the term rabbit too commonplace throughout Britian to give 
credence to the popular tradition that the dish was meant to replace the rabbits the English landlords forbade their Welsh tenants to catch. But it is a fact that there
 are few recipes in Welsh collections for rabbit dishes, though rabbits mush have been taken to supplement an impoverished diet...Lady Llanover gave precise 
instructions for caws pobi in her <i>Good Cookery</i>."<br>

"TOASTED CHEESE, or WELSH RARE-BIT.</b><br>
1652. INGREDIENTS.Slices of bread, butter, Cheshire or Gloucester cheese, mustard, and pepper.<br>
Mode.Cut the bread into slices about 1/2 inch in thickness; pare off the crust, toast the bread slightly without hardening or burning it, and spread it with butter. Cut some slices, not quite so large as the bread, from a good rich fat cheese; lay them on the toasted bread in a cheese-toaster; be careful that the cheese does not burn, and let it be equally melted. Spread over the top a little made mustard and a seasoning of pepper, and serve very hot, with very hot plates. To facilitate the melting of the cheese, it may be cut into thin flakes or toasted on one side before it is laid on the bread. As it is so essential to send this dish hot to table, it is a good plan to melt the cheese in small round silver or metal pans, and to send these pans to table, allowing one for each guest. Slices of dry or buttered toast should always accompany them, with mustard, pepper, and salt.<br>
Time.About 5 minutes to melt the cheese.<br>
Average cost, 11/2d. each slice.<br>
Sufficient.Allow a slice to each person. Seasonable at any time.<br>
Note.Should the cheese be dry, a little butter mixed with it will be an improvement."<br>

Like every other cook, my own recipe for Welsh rarebit exeed all others in quality. There is not a dish in the whole list that has
so many methods of making, all more or less alike, but the simple change of seasoning gives different results. To each pound of
soft Aemrican cheese allow a teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce, six tablespoonfuls of musty ale or beer, a saltspoonful
of salt, a dash of red pepper, a saltspoonful of white pepper, a teaspoonful of horeseradish, one clove of garlic. Chop or grate
the cheese. Rub the pan or chafing dish with the garlic. Mix all the seasoning with the cheese. Put the ale or beer into the
saucepan; as soon as it is hot and boiling, throw in the cheese and stir constantly and continuously until smooth and creamy.
Toward the last, beat rapidly. Turn it on to a very hot platter that has been nicely covered with toasted bread. Serve at once. The yolks of 
two eggs may be added to the cheese before heating."

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>French fries</b></font><br>

Food experts generally agree that French Fries, as we Americans know them today, originated in 18th
Europe. Most likely? France or Belgium. A survey of historic cookbooks confirms the history is closely
intertwined with another popular potato product: potato chips. Why are they called "French?"  Two theories
are offered: 1. They come from France 2. They are named for the method by which they are cut.
"Frenched" means cutting vegetables in long, thin strips. Advances in technology
made French fries economical and ubiquitous. <a href="foodfaq1.html#frozenfrench">Frozen French fries</a> were introduced
in 1948. Today, American "French Fry" type products are also known by several different names: steak
fries, curly fries, long branch. They are also known in other countries by other names: Chips [Great Britian]
and Pommes Frites [France], for example. 19th century American cookbooks offer similar recipes under several names, including Saratoga
Potatoes, confirming the popular (& often indistinquishable) relationship between fries and chips. What you 
<a href="foodfaq1.html#frydips">put on your French fries</a> depends upon where you live.  
<p>
<b>Who invented the French Fry?</b><br>
No one knows for certain. We do know, however, the practice of deep-frying foods dates to Medieval
times. 
<a href="foodfaq1.html#fritters">Fritter-type</a> foods were quite popular in Northern Europe, especially as fast-food. 
<a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/books/kiple/potatoes.htm">
Potatoes</a> are a "New World" food, introduced to Europe during the Columbian Exchange. Recipes for frying sliced raw
potatoes surface in the early 18th century.
<p>
"The art of deep-frying was perfected in France during the late eighteenth century. Deep-fried potatoes took on a variety 
of shapes and names. By the late eighteenth century, deep-fried potato sticks or fingers were called pommes de terre 
frites, which was shortened to pommes frites...The US President Thomas Jefferson...made a note of a recipe for 'Pommes de 
terre frites a cru, en petites tranches' (raw potatoes cut into small strips and fried), which may well have reflected
 this tradition. As pommes frites became more common the name was further shortened to frites, and these were commonly 
served at fashionable dinners and restaurants throughout France and Belgium during the nineteenth and twentieth 
centuries...In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the culinary term chips was applied to small slices or chunks of 
vegetables and fruit...and potatoes. Most chips were made by drying or dehydrating...but potato chips were fried. In 
England, this 'chip' terminology became ingrained in 'fish and chips.' These were originally popularized by a newly 
arrived Jewish immigrant from Eastern Europe, Joseph Malin, who opened the first combined fish and chip shop in London in 
the 1860s...The term 'French fried potatoes' was used by the British cookbook author Eliza Warren, whose <i>Cookery Works for
 All Maides</i> (1856) includes a recipe for fried potatoes cut into long strips. Warren's cookbook, with her 'French fried
 Potatoes' recipe, was published in the United States in 1858, and the recipe was picked up in turn by American cookbook
 writers." <br>

<b>Modern American popularity</b><br>
"Beginning in the early twentieth century, potato fires were occasionally served in American cafes, diners and roadside 
eateries, but this delectable finger food required considerable effort to prepare. The cook had to peel and cut the 
potatoes according to demand; left uncooked, cut potato sticks would turn grey The frying fat (usually lard) had to be 
kept at a constant temperature of 340-70 degrees F...if too many potatoes were dropped into the fryer at once, the fat 
would cool down, resulting in flabby, greasy fries. French fries must be served fresh and hot, or they quickly turn soggy
 and limp. Employees had to be trained to meet these exacting standards, a time-consuming process. And working around a 
vat of boiling hot fat could lead to disastrous accidents--a fact that convinced many restaurant managers that French 
fries just were's worth the trouble. During the Second World War meat was rationed and became scarce in the United States.
 Cafes, diners, snack bars and roadside stands had to serve something to round out their downsized or unavailable burgers. 
Potatoes remained plentiful and cheap, and they were never rationed. During the war French fries became a staple on many 
restaurant menus around the nation. By the time that rationing ended after the war, Americans had taken a liking to french
 fries and their sales increased. However, some restaurant chains, such as White castle, stopped serving them because the 
deep-frying set-up posed a danger to their workers. However, during the 1950s safer fryers came on the market, and French
 fries became a fixture on the fast-food industry. French fries, which are more profitable than hamburgers, were a 
flagship item oat the fledgling McDonald's restaurant chain. The founders of the chain, Richard and Maurice McDonald, 
believed that French fires were one of the most important factors in their success. They perfected the frying process and 
promoted the relationship between hamburgers and fries. The brothers used Russet Burbank potatoes, which were peeled daily
 and cut into very thin sticks, and cooked them in special fryers that turned out very crisp fries...French fries had been
 commercially frozen since 1946, but most home cooks didn't want to be bothered with deep frying, and the potatoes'
 flavour was lacklustre. In 1953 Idaho potato-grower J.R. Simplot started producing frozen French fries, and four years 
later a Canadian firm, McCain Foods Ltd., began making them. The new product eliminated tasks of peeling and cutting, but 
the potatoes still had to be deep fried, which deterred home cooks. There was little interest from restaurants...because 
of the accidents and fires that deep fryers often caused. Simplot concluded that the real market for his frozen fries was 
the booming fast-food business, and he sought out chains that might be interested in the labour-saving benefits of frozen
 fries. Simplot met Ray Kroc in 1965, and the French-fry world was changed forever. Working with the Simplot potato 
company. McDonald's researchers devised ways of freezing raw fries and retaining their flavour and texture...Today, French fries are 
the simple most popular fast food in America." <br>

"Whether crispy strips or crackling, paper-thin chips, French fries came to the United States from France.
American legend suggests they were "invented in Saratoga Springs, New York, in the early 1850s, but
recipes for deep-frying exceedingly thin slices of raw potato had long been appearing in published French
work, at least as early as 1795-1796, with the anyonymous, revolutionary La Cuisinere Republicaine. In
1824 Mary Randolph gave a recipe "To Fry Sliced Potatoes" ...so it would seem that even in the United
States, paper-thin, deep-fried potatoes were known decades before they were introduced as "Saratoga
chips." Indeed, directions for deep-frying sliced raw potatoes appear in a document in Thomas Jefferson's
hand that clearly dates from the years 1801-1809, his years in the President's House when he had a
French chef...In both France and America, early pubished recipes call for very thin slices of raw potato to
be deep-fried until crackling crisp, but some authorities believed that deep-fried strips of potatoes had
been sold by vendors on the bridges of vieux Paris well before the appearance of the recipe of
1795...Throughout the nineteenth century, potatoes were fried in a variety of shapes and sizes. During the
1870s some types of fried potatoes were standardized into particular shapes and sizes. Those that were
round and extremely thin became potato chips. Those that were long, rectangular, and approximately one-fourth of an inch thick, became "french fried potatoes," a name that had been shortened to "french fries" in
1918. By the early twentieth century french fries were served in cafes, diners, and roadside eateries.
Although franchised fast food establishments had been around since the 1920s, french fries did not
become an important part of their menu until World War II, wehn rationed meat became scarce and fast
food hamburger stands sought alternatives."<br>

""French fries,"....are easily the most popular form of potato preparation in America and are a staple of
fast-food restaurants. In France they are called pommes frites and were not mentioned in French print
until 1858, and in 1868 as a low-class food item. In England they are known as "chips," first mentioned in
a letter Oscar Wilde dated March 1876...The term "french fry" has nothing to do with the country of origin,
but instead refers to a method, called "frenching," of cutting the potatoes into narrow strips. The <i>Oxford
English Dictionary</i>, which traces "French-fried potatoes" back to 1894, suggests the usage is American in
origin. "French Frieds" dates to 1915; "french fries" to the 1930s..."<br>

<b>When were frozen French fries introduced?</b><br>
The <a href="http://www.simplot.com">J.R. Simplot Company</a> [Idaho]gets the credit for making and marketing the first
commercially produced French fries in the United States. Their product debuted in 1948. McCain
(Maine) launched in 1956; Ore-Ida went national in 1965. Coincidentally? Commerical french
fry machines were perfected in the mid-1950s, about the time McDonalds began.
<p>
Extracted from the "Origins of Simplot" on company Web site [accessed April 13, 2003]:
<p>
"The company's technical staff, led by chemist Ray Dunlap, ran tests on canning and
freezing fruits, berries and processed potatoes. The company was also excited about a new
process for instant mashed potatoes. All told, J.R. Simplot and his employees looked
optimistically to the postwar future. With consumer acceptance of frozen peas and carrots
already established, 27-year-old Ray Dunlap's experiments with freezing potatoes took on
increasing importance to the company's postwar plans. Dunlap, a mining chemist by
training, joined the company in 1942 to organize the food laboratory at the Caldwell plant.
He is considered by many to be the individual most responsible for the development
of the frozen french fry.
<p>
"Going from Dunlap's initial breakthrough to the development of an economically feasible,
marketreceptive frozen french fry was a long and arduous journey for the Simplot Company
and the processed potato industry. For J.R. Simplot and the group of dedicated young
managers who came into the company in the postwar years, those early days presented a
series of challenges. With his food and fertilizer businesses on the cusp of a major growth
spurt, the pressure on the company's founder to maintain the momentum of the war years
mounted...
Far from slowing down, shedding the day-to-day responsibilities at Caldwell and Pocatello
freed Simplot to do what he liked to do best: pursue new opportunities at a breakneck pace,
while keeping tabs on his growing enterprise.

<p>
"During these postwar years, the reputation of both J.R. Simplot and his company grew
measurably...From a production standpoint, the development of the frozen french fry
presented many technical obstacles, all of which had to be circumvented through original
engineering as well as trial and error.

<p>
The Simplot Company's first attempt to produce commercial frozen french fries came in
1948, using a converted potato chip fryer. The company's technical staff, led by Ray Dunlap
and Ray Keuneman, soon discovered that, unlike the potato chip, the french fry strips sank
in the fryer's boiling shortening. The rakes that were designed to move the potato chips
along the fryer as they floated in hot fat had no effect on the french fries that were sinking to
the bottom of the fryer. Another major obstacle was that the oil-fired fryer broke down the
vegetable oil rapidly. The key technological breakthrough in early 1953 focused on the
development of a continuously running fryer. Previous methods had been limited to a batch
process because of a breakdown in the oil used to fry the potato strips. By developing a way
to constantly circulate the oil and to purify it periodically through a centrifuge, the scientists
were able to put an end to the limitations of the batch process. With the barrier to feasible
mass production removed, the company recognized it needed to create a professional sales
organization. Such an organization wasn't necessary during the war years because Simplot
had only one customer   the U. S. government. The company's wartime experience had,
however, helped to establish contacts in the food industry, including the nation's premier
frozen food companies.
Although the company did achieve modest success in selling frozen fries at the retail level,
both J.R. Simplot and Leon Jones felt the potential for the product was greater at the
institutional level. However, it was the household consumer in these early years, not the
restaurant chef, who embraced the product.
For the homemaker, the task of finishing frozen fries in an oven was preferable to using a
deep fat fryer. Convincing restaurant operators proved to be more difficult. 
<p>
"A national shortage of potatoes in 1950-51 played a fortuitous role in the company's
efforts to break into the institutional market. Having already contracted a large quantity of
potatoes prior to the shortage, the company had leverage to penetrate some of the larger
Midwestern and eastern institutional
markets that it previously had not been able to crack. Coinciding with the company's
increasing success with mass-producing and marketing french fries was an explosion in the
frozen potato industry. Between 1951 and 1961, the annual total production of frozen
potato products industrywide increased from 25 million pounds to nearly 484 million
pounds."<br>

"In 1945, Ray Dunlap was a chemist at the Simplot lab in Caldwell. He wanted J.R. to give him a
freeze box so that he could practice freezing vegetables. "Hell," J.R. told him, "you freeze spuds
and they will go to mush." He bought the guy a 10 foot box anyway and a few months later J.R.
was tasting hot french fries that had been previously frozen. "I ate some and said, 'My God, good
product.'" They used the dip method at first, then built automatic machines. Within six months
Simplot had a 10,000-ton cold storage facility and a 60-ton per day ice manufacturing plant. They
also made potato granules, which became "instant mashed potatoes." He didn't try to protect his
frozen french fry patent, at first. "Hell, it was just a lawsuit you know, back in those days. Then I
got one after I met with McDonald's and gave them the patent to get their business. I had all their
business for 10 or 15 years." <br>

<b>Quebec's poutine</b><br>
"Poutine. This word named many kinds of food in Quebec and Acadia. Here we discuss only the modern Quebec dish and provincial uses of
the word. For details on Acadian use as in poutines rapees and poutine au pain, please see the poutine entry under Acadian foods. Now pronounced [poo-TSIN] in Canadian French, the word stems ultimately from the English word pudding. Facinatingly, it has been borrowed at least
four different times into French. Le pudidng was in French print by 1678 to denote a pudding steamed in a cloth bag. This acquired several varints including le pouding, and, in 
northern France, poudin...The most recent reincarnation...of poutine happened in Quebec in the fall of 1957, and made poutine the most
familiar Quebec food word in North America...Today's poutine is a serving of thick-cut French fries, topped with fresh cheese curds and hot gravy 
poured on top of the curds before serving...served in a little gravy dish on the side so the fries do not get soggy. Two men claim to have invented this
poutine in the fall of 1957 in a region called Bois-Francs 'hardwoods' just south of the St. Lawrence. In Warwick, Quebec, near 
Victoriaville, halfway between Montreal and Quebec City, Fernand Lachance, 'le pere la poutine,' and is wife Germaine operated the Cafe Ideal. One of the piliers du cafe 'regulars'
was truck driver Eddy Lainesse. Now the region of Bois-Francs is dairy country, famous for its fresh cheese curds, and M. Lachance
sold little boxes of the fresh curd in his eatery. One autumn day, Eddy Lainesse suggested mixing the cheese curds with  fries. Et
viola! The gravy was not beef gravy ad first, but Germaine Lachance's special recipe of brown sugar, ketchup, and a plop or two of Worcestershire
sauce. After interviewing these three innovators for the October 8, 1997, edition of the <i>Globe and Mail</i>, reporter Tu
Thanh Ha points out just how popular this poutine is in the province."<br>
---<i>Canadian Food Words</i>, Bill Casselman [McArthur & Company:Toronto] 1998 (p. 162-164)
<p>
<b>Acadian poutine</b><br>
"...perhaps first borrrowed--with the spelling poutine--from the English word pudding by the Acadians, this food term has acquired many
meanings in Quebec and Acadia. Here is discussed only Acadian uses of the word...Poutine rapees are the most famous Acadian potato dumplings made from two parts of grated raw
potatoes squeezed dry in a cotton bag, and from one part plain mashed potatoes and formed into a ball about--as one Acadian cook told me--'the size of the fist of my petite tante Yvonne.' In parts
of New Brunswick, a hole in the centre of each poutine is stuffed with diced salt pork. To cook these poutines drop two or three into water at a rolling boil then simmer for 
two and a half hours. Poutines rapees may also be plunked into a gently bubbling fricot. Poutine en sac is another of the old European puddings steamed in a cloth bag, 
so many of which have made their way to Canada with names like son-of-a-gun-in-a-sack, bugger-in-a-bag, cloutie from Scotland, and figgie duff from Newfoundland. Also called
poutine a la vapeur, the pudding is some variant of a lard-sugar-eggs-flour-milk-baking-powder mixture to which is added raisins and perhaps blueberries, apples, cranberries--
whatever's in season. This doughy delight is mixed together to form a large ball, put in a cotton bag tied up with string, and placed on a wire mesh rack in a large pot with an 
inch of water. The steaming takes two hours. A double-bottomed pot may be used, or a double boiler if you want to forego the bag...Poutine en sac can be served with 
sweet cream, brown-sugar sauce...or slices of fried pork. There are also Acadia poutines that resemble pies (poutine a la melasse) and bread puddings (poutine au pain)."

<a name="frenchtoast">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>French toast</b></font><br>
The popular history behind French toast (aka German toast, American toast, Spanish toast, Nun's
toast, Cream toast, Breakfast toast, Mennonite toast, Pain Perdu, Panperdy, Arme Ritter, Suppe Dorate, Amarilla, Poor Knights of Windsor) is that it was created by medieval
European cooks who needed to use every bit of food they could find to feed their families. They
knew old, stale bread (French term "pain perdu" literally means lost bread) could be revived when
moistened with milk and enriched with eggs. The traditional method of cookery was on a hot
griddle prepped with a little fat (butter, oil). Quite like today.
<p>
Actually,  recipes for "French toast" can be traced Ancient Roman times. Apicius simply calls it
"Another sweet dish." Linguistic evidence confirms the connection, as one of the original French
names for this dish is "Pain a la Romaine," or Roman bread. Culinary evidence confirms  "French
toast" was not just a food of the poor. Recipes printed in ancient and medieval texts employed
white bread (the very finest, most expensive bread available at the time) with the crusts cut off. In
many cases, expensive spices and almond milk were listed as ingredients. This is not something a
poor, hungry person would
have eaten. It is also important to note that until very recently, cook books were not written for
the the "average" person. Only the noble, wealthy, and religious leaders were taught to read. The
recipes contained in them reflect the meals of the upper classes.
<p>
"French toast" recipes exist in many countries and cuisines.The beauty of this simple dish is that it
can be as basic or fancy as the cook pleases.  "French toast" is most often eaten for breakfast,
although some variations are enjoyed for dessert.  It has also been incorporated into popular other
dishes, such as the <a
href="foodsandwiches.html#montecristo">Monte Cristo
sandwich</a>. Did you know if you go to France it is unlikely you will find "French toast" on the
menu? That's because in France the dish is called "pain perdu!"
<p>
"...what amounts to French toast seems to have been popular throughout [medieval] Europe. But
everyone seems to have has his own name for the dish: Maestro Martino and some English
authors called it "suppe dorate" and "soupys yn dorye" respectively, while French writers favored
"tostees dorees," reserving the word "soupe" for slices of bread soaked in the potage (which gives
rise to the expression "trempe comme une soupe," the French equivalent of "soaked to the skin").
Eventually, as we know, the world "soup" would come to mean the actual liquid in which these
soupes were soaked. Other English sources surprisingly call this dish "payn purdeu," clearly the
same as today's French name, "pain perdu." And of course the modern English term is "French
toast": what goes around comes around. In England and in Italy, these golden brown bread slices
were served with game meats and with peacocks and other grand birds. We do not know exactly
how they were used in France even though there are several otherwise undefined menu references
to venaison aux soupes, "game meat with sippets." In any event, we have once again thrown in
our lot with Maestro Martino, because his recipe is the most polished of them all, using rose
water where no one else thought to do so. Still, some of the English recipe are not without
delicacy, specifying that the butter for frying the toast should be clarified (gently boiled to
separate out its impurities, which prevents burning) and that the bread would be soaked not in
whole eggs but in beaten egg yolks that have been put through a sieve to make them perfectly
smooth and creamy."<br>

Chicago Press:Chicago] 1998  (p.207) <a href="foodfaq1.html#maestro">Maestro Martino's recipe</a>.
<p>
"French toast is a dish we have borrowed from the French, who call it "pain perdu", or lost
bread...It is known in England as the poor knights of Windsor, which is the same phrase used in
many countries: "fattiga riddare" in Sweden; "arme ridder" in Danish; and "armer ritter" in
German.
One theory about how the latter name came about goes as follows: In olden times, one of the
symbols of distinction between the gentry and the common herd was that the former were
expected to serve dessert at dinner. Knights, of course, were gentry. But not all of them were
rich. Those who were not, in order to maintain their status, made do with "armer ritter'," often
served with jam."<br>

We are delighted to share the origins and evolution of fried cheese sticks (aka pipefarces, fried cheese, mozzarella marinara, mozzarella in carrozza) with you. 
Sorry...not finding any specific chef or restaurant claiming to be the "first" to put this appetizer on the culinary map. Family-oriented chains (Applebees, Olive 
Garden, TGIFridays, Chili's, Bennigans & such likely share the credit for mainstreaming this item. Our survey of historic USA newspaper articles confirms the fried
 mozzarella sticks, as we know it today, gained national dining attention in the early 1970s. A delicious parade of bread encased fried cheese menu offerings 
marched through the this decade into the next. By the mid-1980s fried mozzarella sticks morphed from "traditional" to "cliche." Also worth noting: fried cheese was 
not strictly the limited to the provenance of <a href="foodfaq2.html#mozzarella">Mozzarella</a>. In sum: this "All American" appetizer appears to be a hybrid dish inspired by the collective cuisines of
 northern Italy/southern Switzerland/Mediterranean France. Where bubbling hot bready cheese concoctions are signature 
dishes. Think: <a href="foodfaq1.html#fondue">fondue</a>.

<b>Medieval Europe</b><br> 
Most folks are surprised to learn that Medieval Europeans enjoyed breaded, fried cheese products. The English called them "Pipefarces" back in the day. Countries 
specializing in dairy products (notably Italy, Switzerland, France, England, Netherlands) were among the first to investigate novel ways to serve cheese and related dairy
products. Earliest references to fried cheese (custard, etc.) strike our modern palates as dessert dishes. Savory or sweet, fried cheese graced tables as Lenten fare. History

"Fried cheese is Italian in origin, but certain Southern California restaurateurs have made it a regional California specialty. Several Italian-style or Swiss-Italian 
restaurants serve it as the appetizer course, piping hot form the fry kettle and wit a ribbon of savory sauce over the golden crusted cheese. In this spot as the first 
time for hungry diners, fried cheese makes a fantastic impression. It is a mystifying dish. Even the most skilled recipe detectives are baffled by the savory melting 
cheese encased in a crisp but light crust. Yet fried cheese is so simple any average home cook can do it easily. It is well adapted to restaurant service since the 
cheese is coated with breading and refrigerated for awhile before it is fried. This do-ahead feature makes it feasible for a home cook who can't or doesn't like to
 manage last minute jobs. Mozzarella is th usual cheese which is breaded and fried, however some chefs use Tallegie. Fried cheese may be a luncheon entree.

ABOUT FRYING 
There are many methods of frying. The common thread among them is the food in question is 
introduced to an open metal pan that is coated, filled or otherwise engaged with some sort of fat (oil, 
lard, butter). As such, frying was not one of the first methods of cooking employed by prehistoric 
man. This method required the ability to mine, melt, and shape ore into workable utensils (aka frying 
pans). Historians call this era the Bronze Age. There are many books and reference sources you can 
use to study this period. The earliest print references to "frying" are found in ancient literature. <a href="foodfaq1.html#deepfrying">
Deep frying</a> is practiced in several cultures and cuisines. <a href="foodfaq1.html#extremedeepfrying">Extreme deep frying</a> is a 
distinctly American phenomenon. Fair food to the max.
<p>
<b>About frying</b><br>
"Although the Romans, unlike the Greeks, apparently did not expound on the relative merits of boiled versus roasted meat, Varro's 
idea was that the different techniques for cooking meat were discovered one after the other, first roasting...then boiling...and 
finally stewing...and to many contemporaries this sequence represented qualitative improvement. As for frigere (loosely, "frying"), the 
word had two meanings: it referred on the one hand to the toasting of grains and on the other hand to vigorous cooking in a hot 
liquid other than water, a liquid which...was not consumed with the prepared dish. This "frying" was similar to our cooking in 
fat when oil was used by different when other liquids or mixtures were involved." <br>
---<i>Food: A Culinary History</i>, Jean-Louis Flandrin & Massimo Montanari [Columbia University Press:New York] 1999(p. 132) 
<p>
"Copper frying pans have been found in Harappan sites, and these were termed pravani in later Sanskrit literature. In the Rigveda there is 
mention of the apupas being deep-fried in ghee...and in the Dharmasutras, deep-fried vatakas...are mentioned. Later apakva, based on 
the word pakva for cooking in general came to mean frying. The modern Hindi terms, all based on Sanskrit, for frying of spices 
is baghar, for shallow meat frying bhunao and for deep-frying in a vessel, talna. Frying is perceived as an auspicious act, and i 
is not allowed in a house of death during the mourning period. Fried meat occurs repeatedly in old Tamil literature as thallita-kari. 
Another word for suc meat is porikari, where pori signifies fried." <br>

<b>About deep frying</b><br>
The challenge of researching the history of deep fried food is the term. Webster's New 
Unabridged Dictionary traces the term "deep fry" in print only to the 1930s. Prior to that, 
evidence regarding deep frying must be culled from a careful examination of instructions 
provided in cooking texts. References to boiling lard and notes on draining sometimes indicate 
the item was to be deep fried. Mrs. D. A. Lincoln in her <i>Boston Cooking School Cook Book</i> 
[1884] provides detailed instructions for deep frying, although she does not use that term. Her 
notes on <a href="http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/display.cfm?TitleNo=13&PageNum=34">

<p>
Food historians tell us one of the first foods known to be deep fried (cooked by total immersion 
in oil or lard) are fritters. Apicius, the ancient Roman cookbook author, provides recipes for 
sweet and savory fritters in his cooking text. Unfortunately, he does not describe in detail the 
method used for cooking them. This is not uncommon in early texts; it was assumed the cook 
already possessed this knowledge. Medieval texts contain a wide selection of fritter recipes. 
Although deep-fat fried foods are known in many cultures and cuisines, the Dutch were are said 
to have perfected this recipe, expanding it to crullers and doughnuts. 
<p>
"Deep-Fat Frying. With deep-fat frying, foods are submerged in hot oil. Because of the expense 
of the oil or because of the difficulty of this method, deep-frying is associated with celebrations, 
festivals, and street carnivals. American street fair vendors commonly serve deep-fried corn dogs, 
elephant ears, and funnel cakes. Deep-fat frying, also called deep-frying, is popular for breads, 
like southern cornmeal hush puppies, as well as for battered food, such as seafood or vegetables. 
Some food categories such as tempura, croquettes, and fritters are always deep-fried. In India, 
poori breads are deep-fried, while parath breads of whole wheat, potato, pea, chickpea, and corn 
are both griddle- and shallow-fried. Poori bread is puffed up whole-wheat bread, much like 
chapati, another Indian bread that rather than being deep-fried is fried or "baked" on a griddle. 
While European and Western cooks deep-fry with a single frying, the Chinese deep-fry in 
stages...Batters reduce surface moisture, and a dryer surface reduces initial boiling. In addition, 
batters add color, flavor, and texture to many deep-fat fried foods." <br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of Food and Culture</i>, Solomon H. Katz editor in Chief [Thomson Gale:New 
York] 2003, Volume 2 (p. 80) 
<p>
"Deep fried items could be cooked in a variety of receptacles including frying pans with tall sides, 
Dutch ovens, and woks. Kitchen collectibles catalogs confirm specially designed "deep fat 
fryers" were made available in second half of the 19th century. These were generally wire or 
mesh baskets with long handles, enabling cooks to maintain a safe distance while immersing and 
retrieving items from vats of bubbling oil. This basic design is still employed today. 
"While deep-frying foods, cooks need a safe way to remove cooked food from dangerously hot 
fat. With a frying basket, a cook lowers cut-up food into the fat all at once and then removes it as 
soon as cooking is complete. In the late 1800s paired, close-fitting baskets--called bird's nest 
baskets--were used for frying various sizes of "nests" of cooked noodles or rice that were filled 
with other foods before being served. Large deep-fryer sets comprised of a stamped-iron kettle 
and a high, fixed hoop from which was hung a removable wire or perforated basked. These 
devices were commonly used for frying large batches of foods such as crullers, doughnuts, and 
potatoes." <br>

<b>Extreme deep frying?</b><br>
What makes a deep fried food "extreme?" Borrowing the idea from extreme sports, it's what happens when regular foods
are pushed it beyond normal expectations. Extreme deep fried foods are classic fair fare.
It's everything we're not supposed to eat, times ten.

<b>Modern American sampler of extreme deep fried foods:</b>

<b>Deep fried candy bars</b><br>
"Lisa from Mason City, Iowa, phoned in this development in fair food technology. Consider this an early warning. Our local news broadcast a
report from the Iowa State Fair introducing a new concoction: the deep-fried candy bar. The individuals who invented it worked all winter to
find a batter that would stick to a candy bar. It cooks up in 3 minutes, looks like a square corn dog; inside is a Snickers or Milky Way or
whatever you want. They just fry it up, and it tastes like a brownie. Heads up- might be on its way to the Great Minnesota Get-Together.
Count on it. I'm stunned that no one came up with this before. As a grease-fat-sugar delivery system, the deep-fried candy bar would seem to
be a natural; add a Snickers bar, and you have grease, fat, sugar and salt. Eat the stick, and you have fiber, too."<br>
---"Batter up! Iowa's newest creation is fried candy bar; Grease, fat, sugar - they're three great tastes, but do they taste great together?,"
James Lileks, <i>Star Tribune</i>, August 27, 1999, Backfence; Pg. 3B
<p>
"The fair is a vegan's nightmare. Healthy living and small portions are anathema, and grease the dominant food group. Of 160 food stands, only one
sells the state's celebrated corn. "Get rid of the bad rap - eggs are back" reads the Iowa Egg Council brochure. Corn dogs are not just for
breakfast, but for every hour of the day. The Veggie-Table does not sell salads - which are elusive here - but deep-fried crudites. There also is
"refreshing deep-fried ice cream." This is home to imaginative cuisine de baton, allowing for the fair's top leisure activity: Ingesting and

bologna on a stick, chicken on a stick, pickle on a stick, cheesecake on a stick, pork chop on a stick, and the new deep-fried candy bar on a stick.
Deep frying is a way of life, and no one knows this better than Juana Hernandez. She was married to Joe, who passed away last year. Joe
Hernandez was a genius, for he invented the deep-fried taco. Joe and Juana's Taco Stand, a staple for 25 years, is second in popularity only to
the mammoth turkey legs available at sundry stands. "The reason is, we've never changed our prices and we only use pure vegetable oil, 20 gallons
every three days," Hernandez said. She works each day from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. "We've done it for so long, it's a way of life," she said. Two years ago, due to demand, the Hernandez
family finally opened a year-round restaurant in Des Moines. The income from a successful stand is considerable: some 
booths clear $70,000."<br>

"Leave it to someone at a State Fair to combine calories with cholesterol and sell it on a stick. Drawing rave reviews as the fab food of this
year's Nebraska State Fair is the "Sweet Treat Fried Candy Bar," which made its debut earlier this year at the Iowa State Fair. The Milky Way,
Salted Nut Roll, Three Musketeers or Snickers bars dunked in sweet chocolate batter and fried in a tub of vegetable oil look like a deflated
corn dog. But their taste - which fans say is like a hot-fudge sundae or a gooey brownie - has drawn a crowd of the culinary curious to the small
food stand run by Tecumseh, Neb., concessionaire Jeff Campbell and his fiancee, Linda Buss. "I'd give it five thumbs up," said 64-year-old Mary
Lou Martin of Lincoln, a veteran of 32 fairs. "It's the best thing since turkey drumsticks." Coming up with something new amid a jungle of wooden
stands and metal trailers selling fair standbys such as cotton candy, funnel cakes, candy apples and snow cones is the ultimate coup for a food
booth. When you stick that new treat on a wooden stick, it just about guarantees success. "It's the ultimate fair food.
 You can walk around and eat it," Buss said."<br>

"The new-food buzz at the State Fair _ and you can be sure it's a sugar buzz _ concerns the deep-fried candy bars, found on Carnes Avenue in
front of the Pizza Palace. Your choice of Snickers, Three Musketeers, Milky Way or Oreo cookies is dipped in batter and fried in oil for $2.50.
It looks like a Pronto Pup coming out of the oil. "Oh, it's really good," said Candi Davison, of Lakeville, biting into a Three Musketeers. Her
neighbor, Heather McCaustlin, then took a bite. "Heaven on a stick," she said. Jeff Beaver, a veteran fair vendor from North Carolina, said he
perfected the sweet, rich confection after much testing of batters and temperatures. The candy bar must be cool but not frozen, so it keeps some
semblance of its shape in the fryer...Another new food isn't getting quite as much attention: Deep-fried celery sticks are being sold by Ed Porcelli
from his Spaghetti Eddie's booths on Cooper Street behind the Merchandise Mart. "It's an old Italian recipe. My great-great-grandmother used to make
it, only with burdock stalks instead of celery," said Porcelli, another fair road warrior who travels the country with his spaghetti and deli

"In this era of extreme sports and extreme clothing, Olivia Orme's concessions family is bringing patrons at the Indiana State Fair what she

bars? "This is extreme food," said Orme. "I would highly recommend them," said Joe Caffee of Berne. "I just wish they were bigger." Caffee rates the
deep-fried Snickers bar right up there with his favorite elephant ears and dairy-bar milkshakes. After introducing the "amazing onion" that blooms in
a deep-fried batter and large roasted turkey legs to fairgoers in recent years, the Orme family of Carousel Concessions, Corydon, was on the

The fair, which opens today, will debut deep-fried candy bars and, oh yes, deep-fried Twinkies. "Get ready to stand in line," laughed Karen LaFlamme,
the fair's publicist. Clint Mullen, owner of a Pasco-based fair vending operation, added fried Twinkies to his menu of fried Milky Ways, Three
Musketeers and Snickers at last month's California State Fair in Sacramento. He watched in amazement as upward of 3,000 of the fat-laden
treats flew from his stand each day. "People were coming up to our stand and saying they saw us on CNN," Mullen said. "They were the hottest item
at the fair." So how do they taste? Fried Twinkies take on a crispy outside texture, while the insides transform into a soft, melt-in-your-mouth texture that some have compared to fresh Krispy Kreme
doughnuts. (The calories, meanwhile, shoot up from 150 to more than 500 calories per deep-fried Twinkie.)"<br>

"It all started with church fish fries, born of necessity because Chet Miller lost his railroad job when the Depression hit. That family
business, now involving Miller's children -- and their children, and now their children -- has evolved into something that the patriarch probably
couldn't have imagined: battered and deep-fried candy bars, cakes and cookies, most of them served on a stick. It's standard fare at fairs these
days, including the Indiana State Fair. Olivia Orme, Chet Miller's daughter, and her husband, Larry, have seen the evolution of fair food
firsthand.She grew up in the middle of it -- plopped into a sling as a baby and suspended from a beam during the cooking, she'd get a gentle push
whenever someone walked by with an order. During the years, Orme recalled, her father built and expanded his business, which became more
sophisticated and professional. From church fish fries, he expanded to fairs and festivals around Corydon, where he found his base. He began
coming to the Indiana State Fair in the 1930s. Back then, Orme said, the menu likely consisted of fish, hamburgers, hot dogs and probably roast
beef with mashed potatoes and gravy. Even at a fair, people got a plate and sat down to eat. No more. That's the biggest change Orme said she has
seen, and that could be what's driving the "on a stick" trend. "People don't eat meals. They eat snacks," she said. "They come to the fair to
graze." It all makes Orme chuckle. It's hard to say what her father might have thought about skewering candy bars, dipping them in batter and
deep-frying them. She rolls her eyes. On the other hand, Chet Miller rolled with the punches until he died about 15 years ago.The last time
Orme, 63, and Larry, 66, served up fried fish at the fair was probably back in the 1970s, Orme said. "Then in the late '90s, everything started
being on a stick and in a hurry," she said."<br>

<b>Who gets the credit for creating deep fried Twinkies?</b><br>
"Christopher Sell makes some of the best fish and chips in all of New York City. The potatoes are freshly peeled, and he slips only the finest cod
and haddock fillets into the vinegar-laced batter he learned to make in his native England. It's all exceedingly proper, what with the Union Jacks
and pictures of Her Royal Majesty hanging on the walls. He's afraid, though, that he'll be forever known as the guy who tosses Twinkies into
hot oil. "We won best fish and chips in Timeout magazine last year," says Sell, 36, owner of the ChipShop in the trendy Park Slope neighborhood of
Brooklyn. "But I'll probably just be remembered for the deep-fried Twinkies." Deep-fried Twinkies. Sort of takes your breath away, doesn't
it? Sell can credit, or blame, his infamy on an article that appeared in the New York Times food section last month. The short article, back on page
10, catapulted Sell and his crispy Twinkie to snack stardom. Since then, he has done 20 radio interviews plus several national and local television
shows. Food Network has filmed him for its Unwrapped show. Newspaper reporters are calling. More people are frequenting the ChipShop, many of
them just to buy a $3 deep-fried Twinkie.<br>

"After dozens of radio and TV interviews in recent weeks, Christopher Sell fears that his epitaph is already set in stone.Here Lies the Man Who Fried
Twinkies. Notoriety came calling when the British-born restaurateur tossed one of the famous golden sponge cakes into the deep-fat fryer at his
fish-and-chips shop in Brooklyn, N.Y. Suddenly there's a whole lot of sizzlin' going on across the country, with copycat recipes and reviews of the freaky fried treat showing up on the
Internet. An episode of the Food Network's "Unwrapped" series will feature Sell in the fall. And people have called from as far away as Seattle
asking him to overnight the fried, creme-filled logs. "It's been mad, it's been absolutely mad," said Sell, 37, who owns the Park Slope ChipShop.
"Every time we get more publicity, we think 'When is it going to end?"' Not anytime soon, especially since the Hostess folks plan to offer fried
Twinkies at state fairs. They consulted with Sell in recent days on how best to make the new fair food. Apparently Sell's parents never told him
to stop playing with his food. Twinkies were just one of the foods he and his employees threw into the shop's commercial deep-fat fryer during
random fits of boredom. M&Ms were a bust _ they fell through the fryer basket. Peppermint Patties were a disaster, too. So were Snowballs; the
mushy marshmallowlike mounds disintegrated in the hot grease. Chocolate-coated Ho Hos proved equally messy. Ahh, but fried Twixes,

<b>Deep fried cheesecake, pickles, oreos, strawberry shortcake & fatballs</b><br>
When Norma Bowers started in the concession business, nobody bought her healthful vegetarian food. So she changed her menu to deep-fried
cheesecake, deep-fried pickles, deep-fried Oreos, deep-fried Twinkies and deep-fried strawberry shortcake. Her stand, Fried What?, is parked on Main
Street at the Illinois State Fair, just south of the Exposition Building. "I was watching Diane Sawyer on TV, and she had fried Twinkies. That's
where that idea came from," said Bowers, of Garland, Texas. "The Oreos evolved on their own. The cheesecake you get in fancy restaurants, and the
strawberry shortcake I created myself. We decided sweets weren't enough, so we added pickles." Rounding out the menu are onion rings, mushrooms,
green tomatoes and Snickers bars, all also deep-fried. Prices range from $1 (for two Oreos) to $4. "I think people save up calories for a year and
then go for it. That's why they come here, for the greasy food," she said. The Oreo cookies are speared with a toothpick, swiped in batter and fried
in peanut or vegetable oil until the outside is brown and the inside is gooey. The pickles, a combination of dill spears and chips, are coated
with Cajun batter, fried, piled high in a plastic tray and served with ranch dressing. Cheesecake slices are wrapped in flour tortillas, fried
until the tortillas are crisp and puffy, sliced in half and served with chocolate or strawberry sauce. The cake retains its texture. "Lots of
fancy restaurants in Dallas sell that cheesecake and get $6 and $7 for it," said Bowers, a first-timer at the Illinois fair. * Have a taste for
cold, tangy buttermilk? You can buy a half-pint for $1.50 in the Dairy Barn. "We sell a lot of it on Agriculture Day," said Dairy Barn manager
Tracy Weitzel. "A lot of the younger people don't care for it, but the old farmers love it. Most of them put salt and pepper in it."...* After an
absence of four years, European fatballs have returned to the fair. "People always say, 'What are fatballs?' They're called fatballs because
they used to be cooked in lard. Now they're cooked in unsaturated oil," said Dylan Arsulowicz, who runs Olde World Deli on Oldani Lane with his
father, Mike, both of Grand Rapids, Mich. What they are are fist-sized balls of fried yeast dough filled with cream or fruit (chocolate, lemon,
Bavarian cream, apple, cherry or a combination). The cost is $3.50. "They taste like a paczki or a beignet," said Dylan, referring to Polish and New
Orleans fried pastries."<br>

commercial and concessions manager for the fair, but they are a curiosity. ''They're not as popular money-wise as they are talk-wise, but they're
great fair foods,'' she says. ''They're a nice diversion for the customer -- people feel like they have to try them.'' Enough people have tried the Twinkies and Oreos that Smith is
experimenting with other ideas. Chicken Charlie's also sells deep-fried zucchini and artichoke hearts, and the employees have spent off-hours

 Food historians confirm garlic is one of the oldest foods known to mankind. It belongs to
 the <a href="foodfaq2.html#onions">onion</a> family. Wild garlic was native Central Asia; cultivation occured in this area
 (and others) possibly as early as the third millennium BC. From ancient times forward, garlic has been 
appported magical properties and employed for
medicinal purposes. While garlic generally considered an integral part of Southern European cuisine,
we are told the Ancient Romans were not fans. Medieval and Renaissance tables included small "doses" of garlic, generally
in sauces. Generally, garlic was considered peasant-class food. In the late 19th century, garlic was reconsided and acknowledged
by some culinary authorities. In modern times, garlic is a celebrated ingredient in many dishes generating from the southern
European cusines of Italy and Provincal France. James Beard and Craig Claiborne are generally credited for popularizing 
garlic in the USA the later decades of the 20th century. Their culinary focus was introducing Americans to
 the Mediterranean flavors of Provence.

<a name="ancientgarlic">
<b>Ancient origins</b><br>
 "Several species of wild garlic exist, and the cultivated species may have evolved from
 one of these in Central Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean region. De Candolle (1886)
 points to the very wide variation in common names as evidence that the plant has been
 familiar in most regions of the Old World for a very long time. It has been known in
 China since antiquity, and was an important article of diet in ancient Egypt and in
 classical Greece and Rome. Garlic, already developed to a form hardly distinguishable
 from that we know today, is commonly found in Egyptian tombs, sometimes left as an
 offering like other items of food, sometimes playing a role in mummification. The
 Israelites, as they set off on their exodus, looked back with longing at the garlic of Egypt
 (Numbers 11:5). Garlic was an important vegetable to Greeks...
 Theophrastus (c. 300BC) remarked that several kinds were grown; and a section of the
 market at Athens was known simply as to skoroda (the garlic). It was considered a
 strengthening food, ideal for workers, soldiers, and oarsmen, and often prescribed by
 dieticians; but some upperclass voices were raised against its smell."<br>

"Garlic has been long cultivated in China under the name suan. It is written in Chinese by a single sign, which usually

Egyptians made great use of it. Archaeologists have not found the proof of this in the monuments, but this may be because the plant was
considered unclean by the priests."<br>

in particular...bore the odor of peasantry, but as yo will see in the recipes was  by no means barred from genteel tables...
Garlic had an especially prominanet role to play in the sauce known as agliata or aillee, which was esteemed by one and all, judging
by the large number of recipes for it...In the various versions of agliata/aillee, the powder of garlic is always moderated and 
refined by other ingredients, including spices, and this sauce is not paired with boiled or roast meat, except as one of several

it) with young kid and boiled capon--after the aspics, the roast partridges, and the young pheasants. In other words, garlic was by no means

garlic. Sixty-five years later, when Craig Claiborne's <i>New York Times Cookbook</i> appeared, things were staring to change.
 Although only two of the fifteen hundred recipes in the book contained the word 'garlic' in the title, there were dozens
 of others in which a clove of garlic or two had made its way onto the page...The food writer James Beard made a major contribution to 
getting garlic on the map. In 1954 Beard write about an old Provencal recipe that called for cooking gharlic a chicken with forty
cloves of garlic. Thousands of his readers tried it and liked it. At about the same time, the social critic Russell Lynes, in his
famous discourse on high-brow and low-brow phenomena, wrote about how the upscale cook might rub a wooden salad bowl with a clove
of garlic to make the lettuce taste better. Whether for health or culinary reasons, the use of garlic in the United States has 
quadrupled since the early 1970s."<br.

"Garlic has been the vehicle in the United States of a self-reversing snobbery. Before I left America to live in Europe in 1927, 
you were looked down upon if you ate garlic, a food fit only for ditchdiggers; when I returned in 1940, you were looked down upon if you 
<i>didn't</i> eat it. It had become the hallmark of gastronomic sophistication, and I was overwhelmed by meals offered by thoughtful
friends, who catered to my supposedly acquired dashing Gallic tastes by including garlic in every dish except ice cream; their
intentions wer egood, but their premise faulty. 'Garlic is a ncessary presence in many of the most celebrated dishes in every course of
both <i>haute cuisine</i> and <i>cuisine bourgeoise</i>,' one of our best magazine writers has explained. The fact that garlic is regarded almost with horror
 by the <i>haute cuisine</i> and is looked on askance by the <i>cuisine bourgeoise</i>. In France, garlic is an attribute of 
neither of the two classic forms of professional cooking; it is a <i>regional</i> phenoemnon. Garlic reigns almost everywhere
south the Loire, most decisivley, perhaps, in the Catalan country., In all of Languedoc the name of the classic garlic soup,
translated from one or another of the various forms of Occitan, comes out as 'boiled water'--gralic is taken so much for
granted that it does't even have to be mentioned. To the east it is called 'the truffle of Provence,' and <i>ailoi</i>, garlic
mayonnaise, is called 'the butter of Provence.' Garlic is a regional phemomenon in Italy too, where, except for a few special
dishes like the Piedmont's <i>bagna cauda</i>, it is confined mostly to the south. Southern France and southern Italy were both 
subjected at the beginning of their histories to Greek influence, which is why they like garlic today.. If so, it seems
curious that so many of our food writers insist that the ancient Greeks detested garlic; but much of has been written in the
United States about garlic since Americans discovered it comes under the head of mythology."<br>

"It was Marcel Boulestin, a French chef and cookbook author who spent most of his life in London, who observed about Provence, 
'It is not really an exaggeration to say that peace and happiness begin, geographically, where garlic is used in cooking.' But
apparently not everyone would agree. One detractor suggested that in deference to alliumphobes I should say that in recipes that garlic may
be added 'if desired,' just as I now do with salt. It is not a question of deference. I have never considered my recipes to be unalterable. Minor
flavors should be altered according to taste. Althogh I am quite fond of garlic, I consider it in most uses as a minor ingredient. For those
who are allergic to garlic, finely minced shallots could be substituted...I should add that there are some dishes in which
garlic is abslolutely essential. These include garlic soup, garlic sausages, aioli, that Italian garlic 'bath' for vegetables known
as bagna caoda, and skordalia, the Green garlic mayonnaise."<br>

<b>What is Elephant garlic? </b><br>
This oversized allum is techically a leek. It presents in oversized cloves, hence the name. Sweeter and milder than traditional
garlic, it can be stand alone as a vegetable, cooked or raw. Food historians confirm this
plant, like cousins garlic and onions, existed in ancient times. Agricultural schools and corporations experimented with the plant, creating 
several varieties. Over the years, elephant garlic has been marketed under several names, including "great headed."
The name "elephant garlic" first surfaces in USA print in the mid-1930s "Believe it or not, elephant garlic." ("Garden Plots Provoke
Peel," Bob Peel, <i>Post-Standard</i> Syracuse NY, Feburary 24, 1935 (p. 23)]. In the 1970s American home gardeners

roasted.

practice of garlic roasting. It is much larger than normal garlic bulbs...and has a considerably milder flavor."<br>

garlic for pneumonia and suppurating wounds, but warned that it 'caused flatulence...',...In India...It was claimed that [garlic]
 posessed diuretic properties, were beneficial to the digestive tract, were good for the eyes, acted as heart stimulants, and
had antirheumatic qualities. In the Ayurvedic (Sanskrit) and Unani Tibb (Greco-Ariboc) systems, garlic has been employed both as a 
prophylactic and as a cure for a variety of disease, including arteriosclerosis, cholera, colic, dysentery, dyspepsia, gastri and 
intestinal catarrh, and typhoid. Duodenal ulcers, laryngeal tuberculosis, and lupus have all been treated with garlic juice, and garlic
preparations have been give for bronchiactasis, gangrene of the lung, pulmonary phthisis, and whooping cough...The Greek military
physician Diocordies (A.D. 40-90) was clearly impressed with garlic, onion, and other alliums as medicinal plants. He advised
barlic for baldness, birthmarks, dog and snake bites, eczema, leprosy, lice, nits, toothache, ulcers, and worms. He also suggested
it as a vermifuge and diuretic and as a treatment for rashes and other skin disorders."<br>

removes moles and sycosis. Eaten cooked or raw it alleviates chronic coughs, soothes a painful throat and clears the voice. If one eats
garlic in advance one will be immune to pests and other noxious creatures. Ground and applied it cures the wounded; it is also very helpful
if drunk with wine. It is rather useful to those unagble to digest their food. It provkes urination, cures nephritis, prevents

<b>Garlic folklore & mythology</b><br>
"Garlic suffered a poor reputation in ancient legends because both the vegetables themselves and the people who eat them give
off offensive odors. People believed that strong odors offended the gods. In myth, fragrant perfumes and spices characterized the
gods, and repugnant odors characterized demons...People of today may not consider the smell of garlic putrid or rotten, but some people of the 
past considered it so for several reasons. In the religions of India, people likened garlic and onions to flesh foods because they resembled
human heads...In India, this likeness...led to the belief that demons desired garlic and onions just as they desired blood 
sacrifice...In Buddhist myth, garlic arise from the blood of a demonic spirit killed by the god Vishnu. In Islamic myth, garlic
arose from the left foot of Satan...The connection of garlic and onions with demons and devils made these foods suitable 
offerings to the underworld spirits...Ancient people used the power of garlic for myriad purposes, most aimed at removing evil
influence. The ancient Persians fed garlic to the devil to drive him away. And ancient Italians wore garlic cloves as charms against the
evil eye...Some believe it repels witches, vampires, and demons of all sorts. Long ago, people in India and England used garlic in 
exorcism rites, believing that people possessed by the devil could consume garlic to remove the demon from their bodies. This likely
led to the use of garlic for medicinal purposes. Surely if garlic had the power to drive out demons, it had the power to cure diseases.
After all, in ancient thought, demons brought disease. In Greek myth, the evil goddess Hecate had the power either to cure
or cause disease. The Greeks offered her garlic to rouse her powers, and because Hecate resided at crossroads, travelers often
carried garlic to protect themselves from evil influence. The pungency of garlic and its association with death and decay made
it both a powerful weapon and an impure food. People concerned with ritual purity understood garlic to violate their desired
condition...In classical Greece, atheletes consumed garilc before competitions and warriors consumed it before battles."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Generic vs national brand name foods</b></font><br>
Generic foods (no frills bands with plain black & white labels) were 
introduced to the American public in the late 1970s. According to the <i>New 
York Times</i>, the first company to offer these products was the Jewel Tea 
Companies of Chicago. The year? 1977. Generics were introduced as 
a way for supermarkets to keep afloat during a difficult period of 
inflation. 
<p>
"In the early postwar years, competition among the chains heated up. In 
the 1950s, as an incentive to attract more customers, most of the big food 
retailers introduced trading stamps, which could be redeemed for household 
items, furniture, sporting goods, and a wide variety of other 
products...As popular as supermarkets had become with the U.S. public, 
they suffered a crisis of confidence in the 1960s as governmental and 
consumer groups assailed both the quality of supermarkets' food products 
and their high prices. A principal criticism of the foods 
themselves...Consumers also charged that the supermarket chains had 
increased their prices to cover the high costs of overhead, promotion 
techniques, and advertising...Though price competition had long been a 
major factor in grocery retailing, it had reached a new level of intensity 
[in the 1970s] when many stores began offering unbranded generic goods 
among the most basic staple product categories such as salt, flour, sugar, 
soft drinks, cooking fats, soups, and paper products. Generics underpriced 
even house labels, though the quality levels were also well below those of 
national and house brands. Also, in the middle and late 1970s, as inflation 
in the United States soared and economic growth stagnated, no-frills 
grocery stores that reduced amenities to a minimum and required customers 
to bag their own purchases began to appear...As economic conditions 
improved in the 1980s, generic and no-frills growth stalled at less than 
expected levels. Once again stores began to attract customers by building 
bigger and better stores and emphasizing quality." <br>
----<i>The Advertising Age Encyclopedia of Advertising</i>, John McDonough editor 
[Fitzroy Dearborn:New York] 2003, Volume 2:F-O (p. 702) 
<p>
"Two major supermarket chains in the New York area have announced plans to 
introduce "generic" products--unbranded items that will sell for 
significantly less than either brand-name or house-brand merchandise. 
Other major chains in the area said they were watching the development, 
possibly to join what seems to be becoming a national trend. Announcing 
its new program yesterday, the Pathmark chain said it was stocking its 
105 regional supermarkets beginning today with a new line of "New Frills" 
foods and household products priced at up to 33 percent less than national 
brands. Pathmark executives said they could offer the lower prices by 
selecting slightly lower grade but still high quality products and 
packaging them in standard cans and bottles without advertising...In a 
parallel development, the Waldbaum's chain of supermarkets announced it 
would introduce tomorrow its own generic-foods line offering savings of at 
least 40 percent. "Its a terrific development," said Rosemary Pooler, head 
of the New York State Consumer Protection Board. "It's about time stores 
started cutting the 'benefits' like packaging and advertising that 
consumers never wanted." The new generic line creates, in effect, a 
three-tier pricing system. At the top are the name brands...A little 
cheaper is the House brand...[and] a plain can marked "No Frills" will be 
offered." <br>

Blumenthal, <i>The New York Times</i>, March 1, 1978 (p. B5)

"The inflationary spiral has sent supermarkets into a tailspin. They have 
always subsisted on tiny profit margins---eight-tenths of a percent 
compared with, for example, 4 percent for department stores--but now they 
are under even greater pressure. They have been desperately experimenting 
with ways to stay afloat, adding nonfood links, intensifying giveaways and 
promotions, selling food in bulk, offering special purchases at attractive 
discounts, introducing automated checkout systems to increase 
productivity. Among the latest ideas: generic brands, representing goods 
lower in price and grade than house brands, and super supermarkets, huge 
stores that provide higher sales per square foot...Generics, which usually 
carry a lower Government grading, are lines of fruits, vegetables and 
other goods, sold in plain wrappers, at prices 33 percent below national 
brands and about 10 to 20 percent below stores' own so-called private 
brands. They were introduced by the Jewel Tea Companies of Chicago, about 
a year and-a-half ago. The public has shown an undeniable preference for 
them, despite criticism form some in the industry that they are 
inferior." <br>

"Ginger--The underground rhizome of a tropical flowering plant, gingerroot (Zingiber officiale)...the 
word zingiber means "horn shaped" in Sanskrit and was applied to ginger because of the shape of the 
rhizomes. Ginger was used in China and India 7,000 years ago and was an important item in the spice 
trade that stretched overland and by sea from India to the ports of the eastern Mediterranean, and to 
Egypt via the Red Sea. Although known to the Greeks and the Romans, ginger apparently only 
became popular in Europe during the Middle Ages. The Portuguese took it to Africa as they 
explored the western coast of that continent in the fifteenth century, and the Spaniards carried it to 
the New World in the following century. In fact, the latter encouraged the cultivation of ginger in the 
Americas as part of an effort to grow those exotic (and expensive) spices that usually were only 
available in the East." <br>

"By the fourth millennium BC--six thousand years ago--the Austronesians' were beginning to spread 
southwards across the Malay archipelago, starting from the coast of south-eastern China and from 
mountainous Taiwan...No written history, and no surviving oral tradition, tells of this epic series of 
migrations. Eventually they reached as far as Madagascar on the western edge of the Indian Ocean 
and even distant Easter Island in the eastern Pacific. We know of the migration by linguistic detective 
work...Among the typical flora of southern China and Indochina are the wild gingers and their 
relatives--showy plants with typically large white or yellow flowers, spicy, aromatic, very important 
in traditional medicine....we concentrate on ginger itself, because there are two good clues that 
ginger is a very ancient spice, perhaps the most ancient of all. The botanical clue is that, unlike its 
relatives, ginger is propagated only by splitting the root, never from seed--as sign that it has grown for 
so long under human control that it has lost one of the essential characteristics of the wild plant form 
which it derives...The linguistic clue is that a name for ginger can be traced back from its modern 
forms in many of the Austronesian languages to the early Austronesian speech of the Philippines. 
This means that in all their long migrations from the Philippines onwards the speakers of 
Austronesian languages never lost their familiarity with ginger...In the boats that humans built in 
those ancient times there was no room for luxuries. Ginger, then, must have been recognized as a 
necessity of life...Finding that it did not already grow where they planned to settle, the Austronesian-speaking migrants planted ginger in their gardens on each new island. Thus is spread from southern 
China to the Philippines and the Spice Islands--and, from that crossroads, onwards both east and 
west...Why...did ginger spread so far so early? Why was it in demand? The traditional medicine of the 
Greeks and Romans, two thousand years ago, begins our exploration of the written history of ginger." <br>

<b>Ginger in China</b><br>
"Ginger (Zingiber officianale,; chiang) has had a long, illustrious role in Chinese cuisine. Its 
importance throughout history is revealed by repeated reference to it in Food in Chinese culture, more 
numerous than for vinegar, sugar, garlic, soy sauce, or any other spice or flavoring. Ginger is a 
perennial herb, ordinarily grown as an annual, whose rhizome and its derivatives are not only 
important as spices but as medicines as well. The plant is believed by botanists to have been 
domesticated in India, Southeast Asia, or South China. In China, ginger was already known in Chou 
times...if not earlier. The plant was carried west from India to Africa by the Arabs, and at least by the 
tenth century A.D. Zanzibar was a supplier of the ginger trade. The rhizome reached Europe by the 
first century A.D., with its Greek and Latin names, like its Arabic and Persian ones, deriving 
ultimately from India...China, along with India, was an important early supplier of the ginger trade, 
and Chinese ginger was carried far across the Old World to market, much of it for pharmaceutical 
purposes...In China, ginger is grown extensively in the southern and central provinces, with some 
cultivation as far north as Shatung...Ginger has been consumed in China, in an impressive range of 
ways, since antiquity. For T'ang times, one reads of ginger as a drug, of ginger-flavored tea, ginger 
wine, honeyed ginger, ginger-flavored meat and, for aboriginal groups in the south, of the contents of 
water buffalo stomach flavored with ginger...In modern China, people single out the root of young 
ginger...for its delicate flavor, absence or near absence of fibers, and thinner skin that that of mature 
ginger. Young gingerroot may be pickled, preserved in other ways, or employed as a spice, and is 
ordinarily used in larger amounts than mature ginger...Grated gingerroot, with sesame oil and sugar, 
may be made into a condiment. Gingerroot may be included in sauces and marinades,...It may be 
made into a sweet soup...Or it may simply be a flavoring ingredient in a dish...Ginger is one of the pu 
or strengthening foods or medicines, and since antiquity it has enjoyed a strongly positive image for 
maintaining health and well being. Confucius, it is said, always had ginger when he ate." <br>

"Ginger. This is an ancient material, with names in Sanskrit that are borrowed form even earlier usage...Both the green and
dry forms of ginger, adhrak and sunthi in Hindi, are still in active use. They are viewed somewhat differently in ayurvedic
terms. Dry dinger is simply pungent, whil the green material is considered both pungent and sweet, though both have a sweet aftertaste...Green
ginger boiled with milk and sugared is a household remedy for colds and chills. A piece of fresh ginger, placed with soem salt on the
dining leaf in south India, starts the meal and stimu,ates the process of digestion. Budhhist monks, as noted by I ching in the fifth

authors had traditionally described it as Indian: this was misleading, thought it is possible that some supplies of ginger came to

"The ginger plant is unknown in the wild state, but is thought to have originated in SE Asia. It has 
been cultivated since ancient times, and was among the most highly prized of the eastern imports to 
the Roman Empire. However, Romans used it relatively little in cookery, prizing it rather for 
medicinal purposes. The fall of the Roman Empire did not stop the trade of ginger to Europe. It was 
in use in England in Anglo-Saxon times; and in later medieval times it was almost as common in 
England as pepper. By that time it was also being imported in preserved form for use as a sweet meat. 
The history of gingerbread goes back to the same period." <br>

<b>Ginger in Medieval Europe</b><br>
"Ginger was one of the most important spices in the medieval kitchen. It was used principally dried and ground, though there are 
references to 'green ginger' which was presumably candied or crystallized because fresh ginger would never have lasted on the 
lengthy voyage from Asia. Ginger was used in practically every conceivable context and with nearly every kind of food, as well as in more
familiar preparations like gingerbread. Throught he early modern period its use was increasingly restricted to sweets, 
especially in classical French cuisine."<br>

"'Mecquin' meant the whole, dried ginger, described by the author of the Menagier de Paris in 1392 as mesche: 'Note that
 there be there differences between ginger of mesche and columbine ginger. For the ginger of mesche has a browner skin, 
and is the softer to cut with a knife, and whiter from within than the other; item, it is better and always more 
expensive. What was this mequin or mesche ginger? Nostradamus tells us, giving a recipe for ginger preserved in honey:
 'To make the preserve of green ginger which, although it be called green ginger, is of a ginger called Mecquin, and is 
from Mecca where Mahomet is buried.' In fact only the Arab traders who imported ginger from South India and Malaysia had
 anything to do with Mecca; the ginger itself never grew there." <br>

"The English carried their taste for ginger to America, which was avid for ginger from the very beginning of its history. Ginger 
cookies were among the goodies passed out to the incorruptible voters of Virginia to induce them to choose the correct candidates 
for the House of Burgesses. Ginger was included in the standard rations of American soldiers during the Revolution, and after it the 
consumption of this and other seanoners was hardly discouraged by the fact that the number one spice port of the world during the 
first half of the nineteenth century was Salem, Massachusetts, because of the speed of the Yankee Clippers. Perhaps this accounts

<b>Ginger symbolism & lore</b><br>
"Ginger, like cinnamon, cloves, and other aromatic spices, conjures up images of paradise. Fragrant smells help define the gods'
nature; and ginger, fiery and pungent, evokes images of the mysterious Orient, the land of the East that ancients called Land of
the Spices and associated with the otherworld. People cultivated ginger in the East far back in antiquity; and in India, Southeast
Asia, and China they consumed it in numerous forms, using it to flavor meats and oils and to make wine. The also used it as 
a spice, a perfume, a medicine, and an aphrodesiac. Along with ginger's pungent aroma, its golden color and  'hot'
flavor added to its allure and prompted ancient people to link it with solar fire. The ancients typically linked many spices
with fire...Early people of India believed that ginger ignited Agni--the divine, creative fire that was linked to both earth and sky. 
The Mesopotamians appear to have connected ginger with dragons because of the legendary tempestuous nature and fiery breath.
Ginger carries a symbolism similar to that of cinnamon, cloves, turmeric, and saffron. Ancient people associated these spices with
magic, and they credited magicians and shamans with controlling these spices and tapping into their powers. People of the South
Pacific used ginger as a food, but they also used it prolificially in magical ceremonies. Healers on some South Pacific isalnds used ginger to 
cure disease; they chewed the gingerroot and then spat it out onto their patients...Melanesians traditionally used gingeras a love charm, 
and the Chinese used it to arouse the passions and increase fertility..."<br>

<a name="galangal">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Galangal</b></font><br>
Galangal was a popular substitute for <a href="foodfaq1.html#ginger">ginger</a> in Medieval Europe. Originating in China, it was a standard
component in spice cabinets of the day. Like ginger, it was used to flavor both sweet and savory dishes.
<p>
<b>What is galangal? </b><br>
"Galangal--also called galingale, greater galangal (Alminia galanga) is an aromatic root, native to Indonesia, that resembles ginger and is a close relative to the 
gingeroot family. It is joined in this relationship by both the lesser galangal (A. officinarum) and by galanga--Kaempferia galanga. In fact, greater galangal (also called
 laos) almost replaced gingeroot in much of the cooking of Southeast Asia. Lesser galangal and galanga are also eaten, but more as a cooked vegetable than a
 spice. At one time, galangal was widely used in Europe (for example, in England during the Middle Ages), where the root was sliced in both fresh and dried forms 
and added to dishes; it was also dried and ground. Now...galangal's principal use in the West is in making liqueurs and bitters."<br>
---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kenneth F. Kiple & Kriemhild Conee Ornelas [Cambridge University Press:Cambridge] 2000, Volume Two (p. 1776) 
<p>
<b>Why call it galangal? </b><br>
"Galangal...the history of its name has one or two unexpected twists and turns. It goes back ultimately to Chinese gao liang jiang, which means literally 'good ginger from Gaozhou (a city in Canton now called Maoming)'. This came westwards via Arabic khalanjan, and passed into medieval Latin as gallingar (which Old English adopted as gallengar). In French the Arabic term became galingal, and Middle English took this over as galingale. By the sixteenth century...the name was also being applied to a European plant of the sedge family whose root had roughly similar properties to those of the oriental galingale, and as the latter gradually dropped our of culinary use in Britain with the passing of the Middle Ages, so the native plant came more and more to take over the name galingale, and the oriental spice had to make do with the variant form galangal." 
<br>---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 135) 
<p>
<b>Greater vs lesser galangal </b><br>
"As in so many other cases, it is Garcia de Orta, writing in sixteenth-century Goa, who first makes a clear distinction between the two species of galanga: 'The small kind, from China, is very fragrant. It is a shrub or bushy plant two palms high, with leaves like myrtle, and the Chinese say it grows wild. The kind that comes from Java is called lancuaz [lengkuas]: it is larger, about five palms high, and not so fragrant or aromatic as the other. Its leaves are like a lance blade, and it bears a white flower. It does produce a seed, but the seed is not used; it is propagated from the root, like ginger, and not in any other way. Do not believe Aythos who tells you otherwise, because Avicenna, Serapion and the other Arabic medicinal writers had only a very confused idea of galanga.'" 
<br>---<i>Dangerous Tastes: The Story of Spices</i>, Andrew Dalby [Routledge:London] 2000 (p. 79) 
<p>
"There remains considerable confusion about species designations within the genus Alpinia and as to which species are indeed found and used in China. Ther are, however, two principal ones. One is greater galangal (A. glanga), so-called because its rhizomes are larger than those of the other widely traded spices., A. officinarum, lesser galangal. Greater galangal is a cultivated plant of southernmost China, Southeast Asia, and India and was domesticated somewhere in the Asian tropics...Its rhizomes, which taste like ginger mixed with pepper, are sued as medicine and spice, and also to flavor and scent alcoholic beverages; its seeds, known as galangal cardamom, serve similar uses. Its rhizomes, known as galangal or by related names, have been imported to the Near East and Europe since early times. This product, apparently carried westward by caravan in Roman Mesopotamia on a route from Persia. was mentioned by Aetius (sixth century A.D.) and later by Paulus Aegineta (seventh century A.D.)...Since terms similar to galanga or galangal are used for this rhizome in Arabic, Persian, and Sanskrit...Laufer...suggested that the Arabs first obtained the rhizome in India and that its name in Arabic derived from the Sanskrit kulanja (or kulanjana). However, he dismisses the claim, one that has persisted for a century, that the term 'galangal' derives ultimately from the Chinese name kao-liang-ching (kao-liang ginger). One of his reasons was that kao-liang-chiang in China refers not to greater galangal but to lesser galangal, the most important Alpinia species in South China...In T'ang China...lesser galangal grew in the weast of Lingnan and on Hainan, and was sent north as a tribute to the royal court...In the 1920's it continued to be cultivated in South China on a considerable scale...from which large amounts were shipped to other areas of China and to Europe...The rhizomes of lesser galangal are stronger in odor and taste than those of greater galangal, and more highly prized as spice, medicine, and scent. Its seeds (kao-liang-chiang-tzu), like those of greater galangal, are called 'galangal cardamom,' and serve the same uses. Early in the nineteenth century, lesser galangal was regarded as so superior to greater galangal in India...that it was ten times more costly. We have not determined when lesser galangal reached India, but it does antedate the Portuguese. Idrisi in the twelfth century commented on the galangal of South China...Whatever its date of arrival in Europe, it was known in European pharmacies as 'Galanga minor' to distinguish it from 'Galanga major,' greater galangal. Of special notes is its widespread use in Russia to flavor vinegar and the liquor called nastoica."

<p>
<b>Early diffusion</b><br>
"Galingale was known to the Arabs at least as early as the 9th century...the name galingale came from an Arabic word which in turn came from a Chinese name which meant ginger of Kau-liang', the ancient name for a part of Guangdong...it seems to imply the Arabs knew where it came from (China) long before Europeans did...Certainly, it became a popular spice in medieval Europe...The rhizomes of the lesser galingale are reddish and smaller than those of the greater, and give a different and stronger flavour. The greater is the one most widely used in Thai, Malay, and Indonesian cooking..."

"From southern China comes a spice that was much more familiar in medieval England than it is in modern Britain--even though, in centuries past, spices took so much longer to travel across the world and were so much more expensive at journey's end...Greek and Roman doctors occasionally prescribed galanga: Aetius...in his fifth-century textbook, mentions galanga three times as an ingredient in complex prescriptions...Marco Polo remarked on the fine galanga that grew in profusion in Burma and several southern provinces of China, notably Fujian."

Researching "gluten free" is complicated and interesting because the earlier generic term is "wheat free." The physical 
condition was generally grouped with "allergies." Diet/health cookbooks, government pamphlets and health organization
 booklets sometimes included selected wheat free (and the larger umbrella term gluten free) recipes. The earliest cook 
book we found specifically focused on gluten free recipes was published in <a href="foodfaq1.html#glutenfreecookbooks">1967</a>. The earliest food products were sold in 
health food stores. They begin to proliferate in the 1970s. In 2014, some larger supermarkets (Northern NJ) have carved 
out small sections/dedicated shelves to make gluten-free products easy to find. Of course, tub cookie dough, requiring 
refrigerated shelving, is across the store next to the regular commercial cut & bake cookies. Gluten-free flours are in the regular baking aisle. Please note: the information below is not a comprehensive study. We limited our search to the USA. It is quite possible another country pioneered this special food market.

dips. The poplar 'Onion soup dip' is forbidden. Clams and cream cheese, chives with sour cream, or raw vegetables dipped into PURE

steak, baked potato, salad with cider vinegar and oil. When you want Mexican or Oriental food, call ahead and check with the chef 
(and take your own soy sauce). Be wary of ground meats, frequently extended with wheat. A restaurant is no place to adventure. I order steak,

much as I have--not had the 'hunches' that helped me so often. My husband recognized the teacher in me, related to this problem, when

<a name="grapefruit">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Grapefruit</b></font><br>

Grapefruit (aka pomelo, shaddock) presents a unique history quite apart from its citrus relatives. Generally thought to 
have originated in Southeast Asia, seeds were transported to the New World in the 17th century. The grapefruit flourished. Legends happened. Companies promoted. Science intervened. American consumers ate it all up. Mostly for breakfast.
<p>
Why do we call it grapefruit? Because this fruit grows on trees like grapes on the vine. There is not botanical or flavor
connection. This fruit is also known by other names, most notably shaddock, after the sea captain credited for introducing
it to the New World. 
<p>
Early grapefruit promoters touted the fresh fruit as health food, recommended for breakfast. This paired intelligently 
with period orange/juice market strategy. Search in Michigan State University's 
<a href="http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/search.cfm">Feeding America digitized cookbook 
collection</a> confirms grapefruit cookery. Recipes generally center on preserves (marmalade), juice and fruit salad. Search in national historic newspaper databases (ProQuest) confirms early product introduction, interest, promotions, trends & tastes. For comprehensive results, search terms: grapefruit, grape fruit, shaddock, pomelo. 
<p>
Our research confirms the popularity of grapefruit as USA breakfast fruit in the 1930s. Historic texts and period newspapers affirm widespread promotion and availability. Many suggested home menus begin with grapefruit. Presumably, this mellow yellow fruit also graced the breakfast tables set in restaurants. It is interesting to note that European interest in grapefruit blossomed when USA athletes demanded it be served at the 1936 Olympics. 
<p>
<b>Origin & diffusion</b><br>
"Grapefruit. A large and tart member of the citrus family, the grapefruit is so named because it grows in clusters like grapes. Its origins, however, are something of a
 mystery. All members of the citrus family...save for the grapefruit, are native to Southeast Asia. The grapefruit, it seems, although of Southeast Asian parents, was
 born in the Americas. It is believed that one of its progenitor--the pomelo--somehow crossed the Indian Ocean and moved about the Middle East, eventually 
reaching Europe and then sailing off to the West Indies. There, perhaps in the eighteenth century, it may be that either a mutation occurred or the pomelo was 
crossed with an orange, with the modern grapefruit the result. But further confusing the picture was the arrival in the Americas around 1800 of a ship commanded 
by Captain James Shaddoc, who brought a cargo of pomelos (or grapefruit) claiming that he had discovered them in the Fiji Islands. Consequently, the grapefruit 
was subsequently called 'shaddock' in America. A variation on the story would have the captain taking the fruits to England, whereupon they were carried by the 
British to the Caribbean. A third version would have the pomelo reaching Florida, where it was hybridized with orange pollen for sweetness, and the grapefruit 
came into being. The Ruby Red grapefruit variety was definitely the result of a seed mutation in McAllen, Texas, in 1929. Certainly, the grapefruit has long been 
one of the most popular citrus fruits in North America, but it was only following World War II that it became a breakfast food in Europe--the result of American
 influence."<br>---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kenneth F. Kiple & Kriemild Conee Ornelas [Cambridge University Press:Cambridge] 2000, Volume Two (p. 1780) 
<p>
"Given the fact that citrus trees and citriculture were introduced so long ago to the West Indies, it is difficult to document which variety was first planted there. In 
some caese the story has become quasi-mythical...The story of the grapefruit--also known as the schaddock--is one such example. We know...that a certain 
Captain Shaddock, and English sea captain with the East India Company, brought seeds of this fruit with him to the West Indies in 1683 from the Malay 
Archipelago. A contemporary, Hans Sloane, wrote in his 1707 <i>A Voyage to the Islands Madera, Barbados, Nieves, S. Christophers and Jamaica</i>, 'In Barbados 
the shaddocks surpass those of Jamaica in goodness. The seed of this was first brought to Barbados by one Captain Shaddock, Commander of an East India ship,
 who touch'd at that Island in his Passage to England, and left the Seed there.' From a November 9, 1683, issue of <i>The Kingston Times and Herald</i>, we learn that 
the captain hand-delivered some seeds from an Asian plant or tree to William Jones, a planter from the Mandeville area. But that is all we know. We can only 
speculate whether Captain Shaddock, might have been the brother of John Shattuck, a grandson of Bermuda's governor...And were did the grapefruit get is several 
names? It's called pommelo--or is it pomelo, or pummlo? It is also called pamplemousse, Bali lemon, Limau besar, and shaddock. The source of the last name is
 obvious, but even then, questions remain..It's called a graefruit because of the grape-like clusters of fruit on the tree. Its first recorded mention was in 1750 by 
Griffith Hughes, record of St. Lucy's parish in Barbados, where it was known as the 'forbidden fruit'."<br>
---<i>Citrus: A History</i>, Pierre Laszlo [University of Chicago Press:Chicago] 2007 (p. 31-32) 
<p>
<b>USA introduction</b><br>
"Grapefruit was introduced into Florida by County Philippe Odet, a Frenchman who settled near Safety Harbor on Tampa Bay in 1823, bringing with him the seeds 
or seedlings of grapefruit and other citrus fruits form the Bahamas. Cultivation began in a number of American locations, in Texas as well as Florida. The first
 seedless variety, Marsh, was fortuitously discovered around 1860 on a farm near Lakeland, Florida. Next came the Thompson variant, a limb sport on a Marsh
 tree in an orchard owned by W.B. Thompson in Oneco, Florida. Discovered in 1913 by S.A. Collins, the Thompson was introduced in 1924 by the Royal Palms 
Nurseries of Oneco. The Thompson was the first pigmented grapefruit, whitish flesh and rind reddish orange rather than citrine in color. Then the Texans moved in 
with the Redblush, a limb sport of the Thompson, first observed in 1931 by J.B. Webb of Donna, Texas, and introduced in 1934."<br>---<i>Citrus</i> (p. 32-33)

"The grapefruit was introduced to Tampa, Florida, in 1823 by a French count named Odette Philippe, but it achieved no gastronomic notice until well into the nineteenth century, when the first shipments of the fruit were made to northern markets. The first commercial plantings in Florida were in 1885, and by 1900 the grapefruit had taken on some interest as an alternative to oranges, and, with the introduction of the 'Marsh Seedless' variety, it became all the more attractive as a breakfast fruit. In 1924 the pink-fleshed 'Thompson Seedless' was marketed, followed five years later by a red variety named 'Red Blush.' The 'Ruby Red,' originally discovered as a bud mutation on a Thompson pink tree, is one of the most popular of the pink-fleshed grapefruits and is the primary variety grown in Texas."

<b>[1895: CURIOSITY TO CASH CROP] </b><br>
"Grapefruit culture is a question now before the minds of many ranchers in this country who are progressive and seek to raise profitable crops which 'the other feller' 
isn't raisin. Thus far in the development of Southern California very little attention has been paid to raising grapefruit. Many people do not know what grapefruit is. It
 resembles an enormous orange in form, and has a rich, lemon color. The peculiar acidity of the fruit--a sort of cross between an orange and a lemon acid--makes it 
particularly desirable as a breakfast fruit. For many years this fruit has been grown in Florida more as a curiosity than as an article of commerce. A few years ago an
 enterprising fruit man tried to sell the fruit in Northern markets. It soon became a favorite breakfast fruit with epicures. The grapefruit fad soon seized the people, 
and since then the supply has been inadequate to the demand."<br>---"Grapefruit Culture," <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, February 6, 1895 (p. 7) 
<p>
<b>[1911: BREAKFAST FRUIT & HEALTH FOOD] </b><br>
"GRAPE FRUIT, or Pomelo...The Spaniards introduced the Pomelo into Florida, but recognition of its value was deferred for a long time, partly because its 
peculiarity of flavor was not at first acceptable to the American palate, and partly because of lack of care in its culture and poor judgment in marketing. Now, 
however, it has conquered the market completely, both North and South, and is to-day the prime favorite, though the highest-priced, of breakfast fruits. The 
species of the citrus family to which the Grape Fruit or "Pomelo" belongs, includes also the Shaddock, which it supplanted in the general markets. The Pomelo 
obtained its present name of "Grape Fruit" because of the clustering, grape-like groups in which most varieties grow. Going further back, the name Pomelo comes
 from the Dutch Pompelmoes, and Shaddock from Captain Shaddock, who first carried it into the West Indies. To the Shaddock belongs the variety known in 
Europe as the "Forbidden Fruit." Grape Fruit is often misjudged because of a mistaken but rather widespread habit of eating it before it is ripe--it should be allowed
 to mature just as fully as any other fruit. Most varieties do not attain their full richness until December--and from then on, through April and even into May, they are 
generally found at their best. The Grape Fruit does not contain as much citric acid as the lemon, but it is decidedly antiscorbutic, and possesses some of the bitter
 tonic quality of cinchona. To obtain its full medicinal value, it should be eaten without wine or sugar, but the addition of either, or both, makes it very delicious. The 
present supply comes principally from Florida, California and the West Indies. Increasing quantities are imported each season from Porto Rico."<br>

"The best time to knock a cold out is when it first makes its appearance, because once it becomes established, it will generally last from eight to ten days or longer...
While the patient is perspiring, it is a good plan for him to drink an infusion made by pouring boiling water over a grapefruit which has been cut into small pieces. 
After the mixture has been allowed to stand for awhile, the patient should drink the juice, using from four to eight ounces at a time, about every half hour. Do not use
 other food until the cold has abated."<br>---"Health and Diet Advice," Dr. Frank McCoy, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, January 7, 1930 (p. A7)

<b>[1931: LEGENDS RECOUNTED]</b><br> 
"Since the days when our father were boys and our mothers wore stays and leg o-mutton sleeves, the grapefruit has held a place apart in our breakfast, luncheon, 
and late supper menus. In fact, were a vote for a national fruit cast today, the big cousin of the lemon and the orange would be a strong contender for highest 
honors. Now when spring fever is a common malady there is no better tonic an the juice of the grapefruit, recognized as an excellent aid to digestion and a cureall 
for that sluggish feeling. The splendid quality of the fruit and the unusually low price this year are a boon also to weak purse strings. While average grapefruit may be 
purchased as low as five cents each, the best quality is retailing as low as eight and ten cents...production in Florida and Texas has ben hevier this season than in 
years past and even larger shipments are expected from these states the coming year...To many an inquiring young modern the name of the fruit is a puzzle, for it is
 not related to nor does it look or taste like the grape. To see it growing in Florida or Texas, however, is to solve the problem, for, unlike other citrus fruits, the 
grapefruit globes appear in clusters of from six to twelve and bend down the branches like bunches of huge yellow grapes. As the result of scientific investigation the
 last few years, the island of Barbados in the West Indies is generally accepted as the place of origin of the American grapefruit. The story of its Origin. It was in 
1696, the story goes, that a certain Capt. Shaddock made port in Barbados after wandering in the orient. Among other things he had collected the seeds of various
 plants and some of these he gave to the people of the island to plant. From some of these seeds came the original grapefruit trees, and from them in turn have been 
propagated all the grapefruit trees of the western world. Botanists, when they have sought to find other specimens in the east, have failed. If the plant still exists in 
the orient it has evaded the search of moderns, or it may have become extinct. Though the years its quality was gradually improved in the West Indies until it came
 to be a dooryard fruit on many a plantation. Not until the end of the last century, however, did it cross over and gain a similar position in Florida, where, under the 
eye of scientific growers, superior varieties were selected and raised. Graft on Orange Trees. Even as the late 1885 grapefruit was described as 'more showy than 
useful,' although it was incidentally noted that 'the juice is rather refreshing.' In 1894, however, when Florida suffered a cold winter that killed its orange trees to the 
ground, leaving only the stumps, fruit growers grafted grapefruit on these same stumps and produced the first real crop to take care of an increasing demand. Today
 grapefruit is grown in four states of the Union, Florida, California, Texas, and Arizona, to meet the domestic per capita consumption of approximately five fruits a 
year as well as the foreign demand, for the American example is beginning to be followed abroad, especially in England. As yet European consumption has to wait 
on American production for the most part, for the great old world centers of citrus culture on the eastern Mediterranean have not been converted to grapefruit 
planting. About the Fruit's Acid. Frequently a member of a family is hear to lament that he cannot eat grapefruit or lemons because of their acidity. The curious fact
 and one difficult for a person unfamiliar with food chemistry to believe, is that, despite the fact that these fruits are acid outside the body, they have an alkaline
 reaction in the bloodstream which offsets acidity cause by such foods as meat, fish, eggs, bread, and cereals. When it comes to the marketing of grapefruit it is well
 to remember that size more than quality determines prices in citrus fruits. Fore economy choose the smaller sized fruits, heavy for their size and thin skinned, for
 they will be found more juicy and richly flavored. Standards for quality differ with the source. Frequently a fruit with slight color or form imperfections is priced a
 little lower than the so called perfect grade and the value of the fruit is not at all impaired. Perhaps grapefruit is no more delicious in any form than merely cut in half
 and served as a breakfast fruit or as an appetizer for luncheon or dinner."<br>

Food historians generally agree "gratin" recipes originated in Europe. 
<p>
"Gratin. Nowadays, gratin is commonly applied to a dish with a topping of grilled grated cheese--a usage
deplored by purists who insist that it is the crisply baked topping (which could be of breadcrumbs as well
as cheese) that is the criterion of the grain. In fact, though, there need not be any substance on top of the
gratin, simply the crisped surface of the main ingredient (the most celebrated gratin, for instance, the
gratin daphinois, a dish of sliced potatoes baked in cream, classically has not additional topping). The
French word gratin originated as a derivative of the verb grater, "grate," but it referred not to the grating of
cheese or any other substance to make a topping, but to the scraping of the burnt crispy bits from the
bottom of the pan."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 148)
<p>
"Gratin, Gratiner. Two French terms, noun and verb respectively, which have entered the international
culinary vocabulary, as has the expression au gratin. Originally, back in the 16th century or beyond, the
noun referred to that part of a cooked dish which stuck to the pot or pan and had to be scraped (gratte)
off if it was not to be wasted. Since the 19th century the meaning has changed to the effect deliberately
created by cooks when they cook a dish so that it has a crisply baked top. This is often achieved by
strewing grated cheese or breadcrumbs on top, and the phrase  'au gratin' is often taken to mean  'with
grated cheese', although the gratin effect can be produced without adding anything on top...The gratin
effect can be applied to a dish under the grill, or uncovered in a hot oven, or by using a salamander
thereby giving it a crust. Wither this crust or the dish as a whole may be called 'gratin'."<br>

<b>What is the correct pronounciataion of "Au Gratin?"</b><br>
The answer depends upon where you are.
The term is French. According to the Larousse Standard French-English/English French Dictionary, the
French pronunciation sounds like oh-grateh (emphasis on  teh', the n' is not pronounced). <i>The Oxford
English Dictionary</i> agrees. Many Americans pronounce this term oh-gra'tin (emphasis on  gra', prounouncing the final  n'). This is
reflected in <i>Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary</i>. This source does not offer an explanation for the
pronunciation.

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Greens</b></font><br>

Our research confirms "greens" originated in the Mediterranean. Different regions/climates grew different varieties. Both white colonists and African slaves had been incorporating greens into traditional meals long before the "New World" was discovered. Dishes, flavors and cooking techniques varied according to culture and cuisine. 
The general consensus of the food historians is that African slaves introduced collards to America. Few historians, however state this as fact, probably for lack of documented print evidence. White slave traders chose what to serve their human cargo; these foods are documented. If the traders chose collards, it was because they recognized the item was nourishing and liked. Healthy slaves commanded premium prices.

latter pleasing fare when gathered in the spring, and although it was undoubtedly a peasant dish, Apicius gives a recipe for 
a patin of nettles (a sort of puree) which sounds something like a dish of spinach with the addition of eggs. Mallow was a popular

general estimation here, Perhaps because of excessive familiarity with it as a 'weed,' and partly also in some sections because it is regarded as of 
essentially medicinal properties, the average person ignores its manifold virtues and possibilities as a salad plant, alone or with other 
plants, but John Evelyn placed it among his famous seventy-three salad herbs and European gardeners and cooks have made it fashionable on the 
other side of the Atlantic. In this country also it is now extensively cultivated by Eastern market gardeners, being raised in hothouses between
seasons. The leaves when 'blanched' by covering with earth, or potted and grown, from strong roots, in a warm dark cellar, are white, 
crisp and delicious. The young leaves resemble Endive. Even the ordinary green leaves lose much of their bitterness if washed and macerated in several
waters and they make excellent spring 'greens,' especially if stewed with an equal quantity of sorrel leaves. 'Dandelion Coffee' and 
'Dandelion Chocolate' are made from the root, roasted and ground. The 'coffee' is a mixture of ordinary coffee and 
powder, or extract, of dandelion root. The 'chocolate' contains one-fifth chocolate and four-fifths root."<br>

<b>Cornell scientists weigh in:</b><br>
"This familiar weed is a perennial with a thick, long tap-root and a very short stem, bearing a rosette of leaves and several smooth,
hollow scapes; the juice is milky...The solitary heads are composed of golden-yellow...Tender young leaves may be eaten raw in 
salads or cooked like spinach; the sliced root is also added to salads or pot-herbs. Leaves are usable throughout the summer and are
often canned. Wine is sometimes made form the leaves and flowers. The dried roots...are used as a coffee substitute...the green
parts of the dandelion are antiscorbutic. Dandelion is found in lawns, meadows, and pastures."<br>

<b>James Beard on dandelions:</b><br>
"A sea of golden dandelions thrusting up thorough the grass is a pretty sight--and inspires thoughts of gastronomic possibilities
as well. Though familiar to us all, dandelions are not, as far as I know, native to this country. There is a legend that the first 
plants were brought here by a woman who greatly enjoyed the provocative, distinct taste of fresh dandelion greens in a spring salad.
Being hardy little plants, dandelions then spread all over the country. True or not, the idea of transplanting a European weed for
gastronomic delight is a romantic one. There was a time, both in England and here (especially through the Pennsylvania Dutch
country), that dandelions were gathered and flowers picked off the stems to be made into dandelion wine. This was recognized
as tonic by many people who eschewed alcohol, but would have a little nip of dandelion or parsnip wine for their health. It was
worth nipping, though not a wine of such character or distinction that one would want it constantly. However, during
Prohibition and during times when women thought it was not the thing to drink wine in public, a sip of dandelion wine was considered
good and comforting....I have a book by Macmillan deLoup, published in New York in 1899, which lists three different recipes for
dandelion salads, along with this remark: 'These are not yet popular in the United States, but the peculiar bitterness is
relished by some people and is said to be most healthful.' Dandelion greens have long been popular in France and Italy, and remain
so. There are even a couple of cultivated varieties that are not members of the species that pops up unannounced in one's
garden. The are used in spring salads with a dressing of olive oil, vinegar or lemon juice, with salad herbs or mustard added. I love
the slight bitterness and refreshing quality--it goes so well with a grilled chop or a steak. Years ago, when I was flirting with the
idea of a career as an opera singer, I studied with a brilliant Italian coach in London. He also was a great connoisseur of food and 
a very respectable cook. He would gather dandelion greens, or find them in the markets, and concoct a most delectable mixture for
Sunday lunch. This would be the first course, followed perhaps by some cheese and very good bread, or maybe chops or a
chicken."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Dates</b></font><br>
Dates (Phoneix Dactylifera) are the fruit of the date palm tree. Prized for their natural sweetness, dates (like figs and 
raisins) were introduced to Europe by returning Crusaders. <a href="foodfaq1.html#stuffeddates">Stuffed dates</a> were
enjoyed by Ancient Romans.
<p>
<b>Where did dates originate?</b><br>
"Date. Arabs say that there are as many culinary and pharmaceutical ways of using dates...as
there are days in the year, which serves to underscore the importance of dates to desert peoples. The
date tree grows in hot and arid regions where most plants cannot, and at its top are clusters of
dates packing a high-energy-giving sugar content of 54 percent. The date palm is thought to be
native to North Africa and Arabia--three quarters of the world's date crop is still produced in th
Middle East--and its cultivation stretches back some 7,000 years, beyond even the time of the
Sumerians and Babylonians, who made it their sacred tree. The name is from the Greek daktulos
(meaning "finger," from the shape of the fruit). Dates were also known to Mediterranean peoples
from early times, and the Spaniards introduced them into the New World. Spanish missionaries
carried dates to California, which today--along with Arizona--produces most of the U.S.
crop....Dates are eaten fresh, naturally preserved, or dried, and they are ground into meal to
make cakes. In addtion, dates are pressed for juice to make shekar and alcoholic beverages. They
are an ingredient in many dishes of the Middle East and wherever else they have been cultivated
for a long time."<br>
---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kenneth F. Kiple and Kriemhild Conee Ornelas, Volume
Two, [Cambridge University Press:Cambridge] 2000 (p. 1767-8)
<p>
<b>Early cultivation</b><br>
"The area of origin cannot be pinpointed, but must have been somewhere in the hot, dry region
strecthing from N. Africa through the MIddle East to India--quite probably oases in the region of
the Persian Gulf. Cultivation is of prehistoric origin. The palm is often shown in carvings from
the earliest period of the Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilisation, and it is clear that dates were
then already a staple food. The classical Romans were fond of dates, which they had to import
from their Eastern Empire. The best ones came from Jericho in Palestine. Since sugar was then
almost unknown, the fruit was used as a sweetener, or else stuffed to make a sweetmeat. The
recipes of Apicius include several dishes in which dates are used in sauces for meat or fish. The
Chinese came to know the date in early times...Most dates are still grown in their Old World
region of origin, the biggest producers being Egypt, Iraq, Iran, and Saudi Arabia."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 243-4)
<p>
<b>Why are they called "dates?"</b><br>
"The word date is Greek in origin: it comes ultimately from Greek daktulos, which meant 'finger' or 'toe' as well as 'date'. 
It is usually assumed that the name comes from the resemblance of fingers...A staple of the Middle East for perhaps as long as 50,000 
year...the date was known of, and probably known, in Britian by the end of the thirteenth
century."<br>

<p>
<b>Culinary applications</b><br>
"The date palm provided one of the most useful fruits, as a source of protein and sugar, and was an economic staple for the
Egyptians; it was extensively cultivated through history especially in the Ptolomeaic period. The tree can produce a prolific
crop, such as 200 kilograms (440 pounds) of dates on about eight bunches. In Egypt dates were found in the Upper
Paleopithic site of el-Khargo, but date palms seem to have been first cultivated in the Middle Kingdom. The date palm
was sacred to Ra, the sun god, and was symbolic of life over death. As such it was the emblem of Upper Egypt, and the
Saharan oases prodiced a constant supply of the fruit. This could be eaten fresh, dried and preserved, pressed into cakes, 
made into a conserve, or used as an ingredient in bread. Pastry cooks used them so often as a sweetnener that they were known
as 'workers in dates."...Date syrup, made by boiling the whole fruit and allowing the liquid to ferment, was added to barley in the
Egyptian New Kingdom to flavor beer. it was also added to wine. Beverages could also be made from fermentation of dates. 
Domestication of dates probably began about 5000 BC, and this soon became common across Mediterranean regions...Dates also
had medicinal uses (for example, in a drink to reduce fever) and were noted for their laxative qualities...The doum palm, knonw only
in Upper Etypt, produced a shiny, brown fruit eaten locally...Both the fruit and cakes made of the fruit were placed in 
tombs, and the fruit is depicted in the Fourteenth Dynasty Theban tomb of Sennedjem."<br>
---<i>Food in the Ancient World</i>, Joan P. Alcock [Greenwood Press:Westport CT] 2006 (p. 41-2)
<p>
<b>English dates</b><br>
The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> cites the oldest known reference to dates (the fruit) in
English print to 1290AD. 
<p>

"From the end of the fourteenth century the consignments became more frequent, coming
in from Spain and Portugal, or on the Italian spice ships...Also on the spice ships from
southern Europe came great raisins,  'raisins of Corinth' or currants...prunes, figs and dates.
All were consumed in vast quantities by the well-to-do, for the sweetness of dried fruits
was greatly appreciated while sugar was still rare and expensive. Poorer people ate them
principally in festive pottages and pies during the twelve days of Christmas..."<br>

<p>
<b>Date symbolism & lore</b><br>
"Dates held significance in many Old World myths and were considered sacred or of divine
origin by many cultures. In Mesopotamia, where people have venerated the date palm for at least
8,000 years, the tree is said to have originated in heaven. It served as the Mesopotamian Tree of
Life (a symbol of immortality)--a role it also fulfilled for the Egyptians and Chinese Taoists.
These people made various foodstuffs from the date palm; them made the seeds into coffee or
oil, they ate the fruit dried or made into cakes, and they used the date juice to make a potent
wine...Date palms grew in many parts of the Old World...The desert areas of Persia, Arabia, and
North Africa have been called the Land of Dates because the palms grew there in abundance.
These trees provided a large crop of fruit each year, which served as a staple food and a principal
source of wealth."<br>

<b>Stuffed dates</b><br>
Apicius tells us Ancient Romans stuffed dates with nutmeats and covered them with honey. This was the original 
<a href="foodcandy.html#sweetmeat">sweetmeat</a>. Similar confections were considered holiday
fare in Medieval Europe. Jewish cookbooks also feature stuffed dates. Today's stuffed dates are not much different from 
ancient fare. Then, as today, they are generally made at home and featured on winter holiday tables. The range of modern 
stuffings has expanded considerably. Witness: fondant, peanut butter, raisins and marshmallows.

"Fruit Farcies.</b><br>
These are a combination of fruit with almond paste for dessert. They are expensive to buy; and lathouth their concoction belongs
rather to the confectioner than the cook, after a few trials very good imitation farcies may be made at home. The things to avoid are much
handling and giving the fruit a messy appearance. The farcies should always be daintily dished, either alone or with fancy chocolates, 
fondants, and similar confections. Whatever the fruit chosen, it should be dried; cherries, French plums, dessert raisins and the best dates are the 
kinds mostly used. The recipe for the almond paste is given in CAKES. It may be made a trifle softer than when to be used for cakes. The
stones must be removed from the fruit. Large fruit should be divided, and then a small ball of the paste inserted into each half, the paste
extending a little beyond the fruit. Another way is to remove the stones without dividing the fruit, and push in as much paste as 
possible, so that the fruit resembles the original, and the paste comes as a surprise. The dish is, however, more attractive looking if 
the paste shows. For cherries, a ball of the paste is often put between the two halves. For dates, remove the stones and
insert the paste in their places. Imitation almond paste may be used, if flavoured with almonds."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Harvard Beets</b></font><br>
Culinary evidence confirms <a href="foodsoups.html#beets">beets</a> cooked with vinegar, sugar and spices have been enjoyed for 
hundreds of years by several cultures. Harvard Beets descend from this tradition. What makes 
this dish different is the addition of cornstarch, a manufactured thickening agent invented in the 
mid-19th century. Some 19th century English and American cookbooks contain recipes for beet 
pudding (a modern version of Medieval vegetable root puddings) and boiled beets, also sliced 
thin and served with butter and pickled (in vinegar). <p>
Our survey of historic American food history sources confirms recipes for "Harvard Beets" first 
surfaced in print in 1906. Recipes proliferated from World War I forwards; the earliest print specimens noting this as a "new" or 
"unusual" way to cook beets. Later books "matter-of-factly" state this is an old recipe, made in New England for several 
decades. None, however, offer print evidence or historic references. This??! Is how legends are sometimes born.
 It is interesting to note that cornstarch companies waged aggressive marketing campaigns targeting "modern" cooks about the same
time as Harvard Beets surfaced. Our survey of vintage American recipes confirms beet recipes combining some (but not all) 
Harvard Beet ingredients. So yes, similar recipes trace back hundreds of years. But they weren't exactly Harvard beets. 
Coincidence? You decide. 
<p>
Whatever the history, Harvard Beets currently occupy a notable position on our national food map. It was only a matter of time before
someone would concoct a recipe for <a href="foodcakes.html#beetcake">Harvard Beet Cake</a>. Where else but the USA can you combine beets, chocolate & cherries?
<p>
<b>Whence the name? Food historians do not know for certain. They do, however, offer theories: </b><br>
"Harvard beets. A dish of beets cooked in vinegar, sugar, and cornstarch. The name probably 
comes from the deep crimson color of the cooked beets, similar to the color of the Harvard 
football team's jerseys. The dish is more than fifty years old, but its origins are still unknown. A 
letter to <i>The New York Times</i> on the subject (January 13, 1982) insisted that the dish was 
conceived at a seventeenth-century English tavern called Harwood's, whose customers included 
a Russian emigre who, in 1846, opened up a restaurant in Boston under the same name. But the 
emigre kept pronouncing his establishment's name more like "Harvard," so the dish he brought 
from England became known as 'Harvard beets.'" <br>

dynasty (c.2600BC) apiculture was well established and is shown in several reliefs in the temple of
the Sun at Abusir. Honey was a valuable commodity used widely in trade--in the accounts
of Seti I (1314-1292BC) 110 pots of honey were equivalent in value to an ass or an ox...The use
of honey was taken to India by its Aryan invaders and became associated with religious
rites....Honey is also mentioned on ancient Sumerian clay tablets, possibly even older than the
Egyptian reference. Later Babylonian tablets give recipes for "electuaries"--medicines based on
honey. An electuary mentioned in the 1st century AD by the Roman writer Pliny the Elder
included powdered bees. It was said to be a cure for dropsy and bladder stones..."<br>

<b>Honey in mythology & religion</b><br>
"The ancients considered honey a divine substance. Mythmakers linked it to nectar and ambrosia,
the
heavenly dew that miraculously flowed from the celestial regions, dripped from the world tree,
and fortified
the gods. In the Old Testament, the Promised land flowed with milk and honey. Clearly, ancient
people
connected the golden elixir to holy places. They used it for libations and offereings, to cleanse and
to purify;
and because it connoted immortality, they used it in funeral rites, obviously considering it a
worthy enough
food to nourish the dead in the otherworld. Early mythmakers believed that honey existed long
before bees,
because myths commonly tell of god nourished by honey in the early stages of the universe's
creation...Civilizations all over the world considered honey sacred and magical, especially because
it was
created by a seemingly mystical process no one fully understood...The veneration of honey and of
the bees
that created it permeated ancient cultures in which honey was not only eaten but also made into
an
intoxicating drink--mead--that was consumed at public festivals and offered to the gods...Because
of its
purity and other virtues, the ancients used honey in marriage rituals. Honey could cleanse and
purify as well
as promote fertility and act as an aphrodesiac...Cultures around the world used honey for a variety
of
purposes--as a purifier, love charm, curative, preservative, and offering to the dead. The use of
honey as an
offering to the dead probably arose from the ancient belief that honey warded off demons, and
extension of
its evident curative powers...As honey was thought to sustain the dead in the afterlife, it was used
as a
preservative for food storage and in preparing the dead bodies for burial."<br>

"The principal honey of Israel seems to have been a thick syrup made from either grapes or dates,

delicacy...and
is mentioned as the epitome of sweetness...Along with leven it was prohibited in burnt
offerings...but the
Talmud declares that it had this taste only for children...Its quality of sweetness caused it to be
used
figuratively for gracious and pleasant things, such as the words of God...the wisdom of
Torah...the speech
of a friend...as well as the seductive language of the strange woman...Bees' honey, found wild, is
sufficently
rare to have been considered among the finest of foods...This wild honey figures prominently in
the story of
the wedding of Samson and Timnah...where Samson, having found honey amid a swarm of bees in
the
carcass...of a lion he had killed, wagered thirty festal garments on the riddle "out of the eater
came
something to eat, out of the strong came something sweet"...Bees' honey was also found in the
forest,
where it was eaten by Jonathan in violation of this father's oath...During the Talmudic
period...honey came
to refer specifically to bees' honey, with the result that a distinction was made; regarding vows,
the
commonly accepted use of the word determined the extent of the vow, and it was decided that

"Honey...is one of the seven characteristics of the "good land," Israel...according to the Talmudic
sages, this
is date rather than bee honey, since the other seven qualities derive from plants, not animals. The
period
between Passover and Pentecost is crucial for the success of the olive, grape, pomegranate, date,
fig,
wheat, and barley crisps, but is not so for the successful production of bee honey. The frequent
references
to "a land flowing with milk and honey" imply, depending on context, either blessing or
destruction. In most
instances the expression indicates the riches of the land...The references to the land of milk and
honey in
the Pentateuch and Joshua are to uncultivated land. These pastures, good for the grazing of sheep
and
goats, and therefore milk production, were rich in flowers on which wild honey bees thrived. In
the OT honey
was gathered from wild bees, rather than cultivated in domestic hives...Since the land was
cultivated during
the Monarchy, prophetic announcements of a return to the land of milk and honey indicated the

of the people, which would result in cultivated land returing it to its natural state: a land flowing

<b>Beekeeping & honey in the American colonies:</b><br>
Our sources confirm honey played an important role in colonial America. Beekeeping was well known in Europe; it was introduced to the New World by early settlers. Honey was employed interchangeably with other sweeteners (refined sugar, molasses). Because bees were "home grown" the honey did not cost average families extra (unlike imported sugar & molasses). Culinary uses (see below) centered on sweetening & flavor. 
"A low-cost source of sweetness appeared during the 1630s and 1640s when both the Dutch and the English imported bees from Europe. the 'English flies,' as the Indians called them, multiplied rapidly and a description of New York in 1670 claimed that 'you shall scarce see a house, but the South side is begirt with Hives of Bees.' Pennsylvania was similarly described shortly afterward and choice honey sold in Philadelphia for five cents a pound." (p. 33) ...[In the Eighteenth Century] Honey was another important sweetener, and farmers north and south kept bees. in western settlements, where honey was often the only sweet flavoring, wild honey was collected in the first, each tree providing from fifty to seventy-five pounds." (p. 62)...[1830s-1965]...In some places, especially along the lower Missouri River, 'bee trees' harbored wild honey and these were as important as game to some professional hunters." (p. 184-185)

"There were no indigenous honeybees in any part of the New World--the Americas and Australasia--but social 'stingless bees and social wasps stored honey in some of the tropical areas there..." (p. 104)..."...bees had been given a new foraging grounds, in the New World, to which they were first taken by settlers from the Old World in and after the 1600s. We may never know the date and circumstances in which honeybees first survived the Atlantic crossing. The earliest likely record that has come to light is in a letter dated 5 December 1621 from the Council of the Virginia Company in London to the Governor and Council in Virginia: 'We have by this Ship [either the Bona Nova or the Hopewell] and the Discovery sent you divers sorte of seed, and fruit trees, and also Pidgeons, Connies [rabbits], Peacocke mastives [mastiffs], and Beehives.' There is unfortunately no mention of the arrival of the bees. In many of the places to which the bees were taken, they survived the winters and prospered sufficiently to yield honey for their owners, and to throw swarms--which spread in advance of the settlers. The bees were called 'white mans flies' by the American Indians, and were justifiably dreaded as heralding the arrival of pale-face intruders; white clover, which spread similarly, was known as the 'white many's foot'...Bees had probably become fairly common throughout the eastern part of North America by 1800."

Although recipes combining <a

black-eyed peas, crowder peas) and cereal grains can be traced
to Ancient African cultures, food historians generally agree that "Hopping John" is an American
dish with African and French Caribbean roots. There are several theories about the origins of the
name. When served on New Years Day, Hopping John is traditionally accompanied by <a href="foodfaq1.html#greens">greens</a>, 
symbolizing wealth.
<p>
"Hopping john.
Also, "hoppin' John" and "happy John." A southern dish made of cowpeas and rice, served
traditionally on New Year's Day to ensure good luck for the year. The origin of the name is
obscure, but several stories abide. One ascribes the name to the custom of inviting guests to eat
with the request to "hop in, John." Another suggests it derives from an old ritual on New Year's
Day in which the children in the house hopped once around the table before eating the dish...
     In <i>Rice & Beans: The Itinerary of a Recipe</i> (1981), John Thorne suggest that the name is a
corruption of "pois a pigeon," a French term for "pigeon peas," which flourished in the Caribbean
but not in the American South, resulting in an etymological dissolve into "hoppin john." Whatever
the origins of the name, the dish quite definately was a staple of the African slaves who populated
southern plantations, especially those of the Gulla country of South Carolina, and one will find
similar dishes throughout the Caribbean..."<br>

"Cowpeas and Rice: Hoppin' John. 
The dish is simple but the names for it are not. Cowpeas are not botanical peas at all but a type of
bean, a low legume that was fed to cattle and calves in eighteenth-century America and named for
the more valued animal. Brought to the West Indies from Africa, cowpeas crept north into
Georgia in the 1730s and multiplied so rapidly that they became both the common "field pea," as
they are often called, and the decorative "black-eyed pea" that Jefferson planted at Monticello.
Creoles called the peas "congri," echoing Congo Square. And when they mixed the peas with rice
and threw in pickled pork, they called the dish "jambalaya au congri.
     The combination of cowpeas and rice also got known as "hoppin' John" for reasons lost in
the mists of popular naming. One lexicographer suggests the name may have been a corruption of
pois a pigeon, since pigeon peas were common in the Caribbean. Another suggests that the name
originated in a children's game played on New Year's Day, since the dish and the game were
thought to bring good luck, beans carrying with them the magic of voodoo..."<br>

"Popular to this day [hoppin John] is a dish that Carolina slaves popularized and thrived on in their quest for substistence. For

food forged on the frontier. Hoppin' John underwent constant change. While we know that it essentially consists of rice and beans
in some combination, it has...be variously concocted to include cowpeas, red peas, small black peas, and calavances, as well as
Crowder peas on whipperwoll peas...Other recipes asked for some combination of bacon, fried sausage, ham, onion, mint, red
pepper, file powder, cured pork, pork jowls, ham hock...Some culture traditionally serve hoppin John ingredients on the same plate 
but kept the rice, beans, and meat seaparate from one another...Hoppin' John's versatility further confounds its origin. Some
scholars identify it as a strictly West African dish carried to the colonies by slaves from the Congo. Others...plausibly
suggest an Islamic origin, noting that Senegalese and Nigerian Muslims cooked hoppin' John with jerked beef rather than
verboten pork. Yet another popular theory highlights the influence of the Seminole Indians, as runaway slaves living among the
Florida Native Amemicans may have adapated the dish to Seminole practices, particularly with respect to the incorporation of 
beans. Even the dish's name has been subjected to a rash of theorizing, ranging from a variation on the French
pois de pigeon to an elision of bahatta kachang--the latter word being a Madagascar-based term for "pea" and the former a
Hindi word for "cooked rice." How did hoppin' John come from either of these phrases? No one truly knows. In the end,
we're left to conclude that hoppin' John's authenticity comes from its versatility and...its mystery."<br>

"Jersualem artichoke...Although widely cultivated around the world, Jerusalem artichokes (Helianthus tuberosus)
which are the tubers of the American sunflower, are nowhere a major crop. In many places...these tubers serve as a minor source of
of food for humans and livestock...The wild Jerusalem artichoke is widespread in eastern North America, and Native Americans adopted it as a
cultivate plant in prehistoric times. The first written notice of the plant was provided in 1605 by Samuel de Champlain in his
observations on the area that is now Massachusetts. Shortly after, the plant appeared in France and then spread throughout
Europe. Its early reception as a food was favorable."<br>

<p>
"The Jerusalem artichoke is a N. American relative of the sunflower, itself native to Peru. Its tubers, and those or related species, were eaten by Indians, especially
in what is now Canada...The plant was soon brought back to Europe, at first to France. There, in 1613, six Brasilian Indians, members of the 
Topinambous tribe who had been brought back by an expedition, aroused much popular interest. Some enterprising hawker of the new vegetable
appropriated their name, which is why the French name for the tuber is topinambour. In 1616 the root was introduced to England, 
from Terneuzen in Holland...The Jerusalem artichoke at first had an enthusiastic reception in Europe, where its curious, sweet
taste was a novelty. It was used in sweet dishes more than as a savory vegetable, but it soon paled and lost favour."<br>

<p>
"England and France, in direct contact with North America, began eating Jerusalem artichokes early in the seventeenth century,
and we hear of their being grown in Germany in 1632. It was perhaps the reasuring familiarity of the word 'artichoke' which 
won them this swift accpeptance, while the potato, offered at about the same time, was shunned as strange and therefore
suspect. When the potato was finally accepted, the Jerusalem artichoke was dropped--partly, perhaps, because a superstition had
developed that it caused leprosy, based on the resemblance of its irregularly shaped roots to fingers deformed by that disease.
From that time forward, the Jerusalem artichoke was considered more or less famine food, commonly eaten only by underpriviledged
peoples...During World War II, the Jerusalem artichoke regained favor in several countries as an aliment which could be had
without a ration card."<br>

<b>Why the name?</b><br>
Excellent question. This New World tuber's popular nomenclature is a classic example of dramatic exotic connection by popular association. How
else to explain a lowly foreign subsistence food associated with one of the highest Christian holy places? The most interesting piece of this
culinary puzzle is Jerusalem Artichokes were never revered as particularly tasty, rich, righteous or redeeming. Except
for a few fleeting moments of sensational 17th introduction. Truth be known...this lowly tuber played back fiddle to the 
potato from the beginning.
<p>
"The Jerusalem artichoke...has not connection whatsoever with the city of Jerusalem, and does not even have first claim on the
name artichoke. It is a native of North America, and wehn Europeans first encountered it and brought it home in the early
seventeenth century they were apparently struck by a resemblance between its taste and that of the globe artichoke--and so they called it
artichoke. It was first cultivated at the Farnese gardens in Rome around 1617, and when it was exported it took its Italian name girasole, 'sunflower'
---literally 'turning to the sun'--with it. The English, however, could make little of this outlandish term, and so they immediately
transformed it into something more manageable--familiar enough to pronounce, and yet suggestive of foreign parts:

connection,
Rorer's headnotes are also accurate:
"Jerusalem Artichokes(Helianthus tuberosus, Linn.)
These are the tubers of Italian sunflower which grow wild in almost all parts of the United States and Canada. They are entirely
different from the true artichoke. The name is no doubt a corruption of the Italian word meaning artichoke. They do not contain
starch and only a trace of sugar, but are fairly rich in carbohydrates of the gum series."

In 1911 USA grocery guru Artemas Ward correctly identified the Jerusalem Artichokes, and introduced fact these tubers 
were sometimes consumed in the USA raw and pickled: "Jerusalem Artichoke the tuber of a species of sunflower, somewhat
resembling the potato in general characteristics, but sweetish in flavor and more watery and less nutritive in composition. There are
two principal types--one long and with red skin, the othe rround, knobby and white. They are generally boiled and pickled or eaten with vinegar,
but some enjoy them raw, eating them with salt, like radishes. They make excellent soup. The name 'Jerusalem' is a queer twist
from the Italian word Girasol, meaning 'Sunflower.'" ---<i>Encyclopedia of Foods and Beverages</i>, Artemas Ward (p. 317)

It is a relief to hear that everybody is ignorant, only on different subjects. This is one of my subjects.
---<i>Joy of Cooking</i>, Irma S. Rombauer [Bobbs Merrill:Indianapolis IN] 1936 (p. 191-192). Why would a popular cookbook
author offer a recipe for a food for which she claims ignorance? Might be telling us something about the tuber in 
prescent historic context. It also makes us ponder: why was this recipe/item omitted from the original 1931 edition of

A. Hyatt Verrill set us straight in 1937: "Still another common weed with edible roots is the wild sunflower known as Jerusalem
artichoke or sunrroon. This plant is a native of our northern states and southern Canada and grows abundantly in many localites as far
south as southern New England, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. It is also cultivated to some extent, especially by the Indians and 
foreigners, for its  tubers are most delicious and nutritious. Moreover, they are  remarkable in the fact that they contain
<i>no</i> starch and hence may be eaten by persons suffering form diabetes or other ailments which preclude starch in the
diet. Although the tubers of the wild sunroot are rather small, and a good many are needed to supply a meal, yet by cultivation
they may be vastly improved and it is not unusual to find the cultivated plants with tubers as larege as medium-sized potatoes. When
cooked these tubers have a peculiar gravies, soggy appearance yet they are tender and mealy with a delightful 'wild' or 
perhaps I might say 'woodsy' or nutty flavor, unlike that of any other root-food. The true sunroot or Jerusalem Artichoke, is the best of all the 
Sunflower Family for culinary purposes, but there are others of the sunflowers with edible roots which were used by our 
Indians."<br>

<b>[1839]<br>
"Jerusalem Artichokes, Boiled.</b><br>
Boil them till very tender, which you may tell by trying them with a fork; peel them, put them into a rich, highly seasoned
gravy, and serve them up.
<p>
<b>"Jerusalem Artichokes, Mashed, &c.</b><br>
Having boiled them till tender, mash them fine, pressing them through a cullender, and season them highly with butter and
cream."
<p>
<b>"Jerusalem Artichokes, Baked.</b><br>
Take the pulp of mashed Jerusalem artichokes, make it into small rolls, bake them a light brown in a Dutch-oven, and serve them with a 
rich, highly seasoned gravy, poured over them. This is the most delicious way of preparing them."<br>

<p>
<b>[1845]<br>
"Jerusalem Artichokes</b><br>
Wash the artichokes, apre them quickly, and trow them as they are done into a saucepan of cold water, or of equal parts of milk
and water; and when they are about half boiled add a little salt to them. Take them up the instant they are perfectly tender: this will be
in from fifteen to twenty-five minutes, so much do they vary in size and as to the time necessary to dress them. If allowed to remain in the water 
after they are done, they become black and flavourless. Melted butter should always be sent to table with them. 15 to 25 minues.
<p>
<b>"To Fry Jerusalem Artichokes (Entremets)</b><br>
Boil from eight to twelve minutes; lift them out, drain them on a sieve, and let them cool; dip them into beaten eggs, and over them with fine bread-crumbs.
Fry them a light brown, drain, pile them in a hot dish, and serve them quickly.
<p>
<b>"Jerusalem Artichokes, a la Reine</b><br.
Wash and wipe the artichokes, cut off one end of each quite flat, and tirm the other into a point; boil them in milk and water, lift them
out the instant they are done, place them upright in the dish in which they are to be served, and sauce them with a good bechamel, or with nearly half
a pint of cream thickened with a dessertspoonful of flour, mixed with an ounce and a half of butter, and seasoned with a little mace and come salt. When cream
cannot be procured use new milk, and increase the proportion of flour and butter.
<p>
<b>"Mashed Jerusalem Artichokes.</b><br
Boil them tender, press the water well from them, and then proceed exactly as for mashed turnips, taking care to dry the
artichokes well, both before and after the milk or cream is added to them; they will be excellent if good white sauce be
substituted for either of these."<br>

Peel the artichokes, and throw each root into cold water and vinegar immediately, to preserve the colour. Put them into boiling
water, with a little salt, until sufficiently tender for a fork to pass through them easily, then pile them on a dish, and serve as hot
as possible with melted butter or white sauce poured over. Soyer shaped them like a pear, then stewed them gently in three pints of
water with two or three onions thinly sliced, one ounce of salt, and one ounce of butter. He then placed an order of mashed
potatoes round a dish, stick the artichokes in it points upwards, poured over them either white sauce or melted butter and
put a fine brussels sprout between each. It made a pretty inviting dish. Time to boil, about twenty minutes. They should be

hundred, is very bad advice indeed. Jerusalem artichokes should be well washed and scrubbed, but <i>not</i> peeled or pared. They
should be steamed or boiled in just enough water to cover them, and the water saved as the basis for artichoke soup, or any other
vegetable soup; it will set jelly-like, when cold, and it possesses the best of the flavour of the artichokes. After they have been steamed or
boiled in their skin until tender--which takes longer when steamed than boiled, and for big tubers than small ones--Artichokes should have their
skin rubbed off before being 'finished' in butter or in the oven, or served with melted butter or any white sauce one cares
to pour over them."<br>

<a name="leftovers">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Leftovers</b></font><br>
Through time, wealthy consumers get "first pick" of food. The rest of us get what's "left 
over." Until modern times, every edible part of an animal and plant was consumed. Waste not, want not. The part of the hog and type of grain you ate depended upon your econonomic and social status.
Wealthy Medieval European landowners dispensed leftover banquet foods to neighboring poor (Christian obligation), servants, 
slaves & dogs. All of whom favored eating over starving. The traditional English Sunday joint (think: roast beef & 
<a href="foodfaq1.html#leftoverturkey">turkey</a>) was 
repurposed throughout the week in creative ways. Some of the foods we enjoy today originated as leftovers. Think:
<a href="foodfaq1.html#frenchtoast">French toast</a> & <a href="foodmeats.html#mincedmeat">hash</a>.
<p>
In the days of hearth cookery it made sense to roast a large joint of meat once or twice a week, and use the "leftovers"
in the interim. Cookbooks in this period do not generally specify "leftover" recipes. A careful examination of ingredients 
and method sometimes reveals if the meat and/or vegetables were already cooked. We suspect, like modern times, there was 
a mix of leftover and fresh ingredients in most dishes.
<p>
In the mid-19th century, leftovers were elevated to the level of creative cookery. Entire cookbooks were written in praise of 
leftovers and the creative housewives who served them with panache. Economical and time-saving, leftovers were promoted, 
not "lowly." In some households, leftovers are expected and some dishes are considered better the next day. 
"Make ahead" meals (meatloaf & casseroles) may be considered pre-leftovers. In the 20th century the standard 
glue for leftover dishes were inexpensive grains (pasta, rice) and commercial soup (canned, dried mix). 
<p>
21st century leftover cookery presents an entirely different challenge. Except for holidays (think: Thanksgiving),
or Sunday dinners (think: roast chicken) we don't generally cook more than we plan to eat. Our leftovers 
are last night's restaurant dinner or extra helpings from pizza or Chinese delivery. We also cook 
leftovers differently. We heat up last night's restaurant dinner in microwave-ready containers, fill omelettes with 
whatever's left the veggie drawer, and repurpose baked potatoes as twice baked cheesy snacks. The "lowly" meatloaf is created on purpose with fresh ingredients. 
<p> 
USA attitudes regarding leftovers set a debate-worthy table showcasing the advantages of egalitarian opportunity versus socio-economic 
privilege. Think: the <a href="restaurants.html#doggiebags">"doggie bag"</a> debate.
American cookbooks praising <a href="foodfaq1.html#leftovercookbooks">leftover cookery</a> should be examined in context. Given the period, what was the agenda?  
Today's upscale restaurants participate in Second Harvest, redistributing leftover ingredients (not plate scrapings) with soup kitchens and food pantries. Modern
twist on Medieval obligation. Those of us breakfasting on cold leftover pizza mirror Colonial ancestors consuming
apple pie for their morning meal.
<p>
"Left-overs of a meal have often been a matter for concern--they should not be left lying around and wasted...The poor 
would gather about the gates of a house where a great feast had been held, expecting to be give what was left...Some restaurants now offer 
'doggy bags' in order that their patrons may take home the expensive food they have not been able to ingest in one sitting."<br> 
---<i>The Rituals of Dinner</i>, Margaret Visser [Penguin Books:New York] 1991 (p. 293)  
<p>
"The English (and hence the American) tradition with roasts is still to bring the whole bird or joint and carve it up in front 
of the guests--an extraordinarily old-fashioned procedure...Large joints are less popular than they used to be because families 
are smaller; added to which, North Americans in particular tend to classify 'left overs' with garbage, so that remainders of meat are 
wasteful."<br>

<b>Leftover cookbooks</b><br>
For centuries, cookbooks contained recipes for "made over" (aka leftover, rechauffee, reheated) foods. These recipes are generally mixed in with 
the general course heading. Books aimed at thrifty cooks sometimes feature a special leftover section. From the 19th century forwards, 
there have been entire cookbooks devoted to this genre. Additional notes & bibliography from the

"This book is not intended as a substitute for the regular cook book. It aims to be simply a practical handybook for the average 
housekeeper, who cannot afford to waste food which has been left over from her table, and who nevertheless desires to serve the best and 
most attractive dishes. In the average family where there are not servants, or perhaps one servant, setting a table with the least very 
margin of ampleness means that there will inevitably follow some left-over food. In addition to this, it is sometimes wise 
deliberately to plan for a remainder (especially where the first-cooking process is a long one, or where the food itself 
admits of reheating to advantage) in order to spare time and labor to the cook. Therefore, both from necessity and choice, the interested home-maker 
finds herself facing the problem of how to make the most and best of a left-over food supply...Many of the finest dishes-- 
dishes over which French chefs have made international reputations--are nothing more than 'left overs' attractively cooked. In every 
housekeeper's own kitchen there are the same foods, and the same possibilities. And let it be added that in no branch of 
housekeeping or of cookery does a woman show to better advantage than in this ability to take unrelated bits of left-over food 
and combine them so as to form tempting dishes for another meal." <br>

<b>[1941]</b><br>
"Leftover cookery, and we feel strongly about this, is the most creative kind of cooking there is, involving both you and your 
imagination and tempting you to experiment with flavors, to flirt with new combinations. You don't just pull last night's roast out of 
the refrigerator and heat it; you make something new...We venture to say that once you have started playing the game of 
leftovers, you will never stop. The field is open, the challenge always there in your refrigerator: in that wedge of 
cabbage, the leaves crinkling and dry, in the shrimps left from a party, the juice from pickled peaches, even in the wiener left from 
a picnic...As far as thrift is concerned, the game of leftovers works both ways. You may begin by that special process of creating something 
new from something once used, but you end, more often than not, by buying and planning your meals in a very different way. You buy 
that large roast beef because you see beyond the first meal to slices transformed by currant jelly...to steaming casserole 
dishes, or to a deep-dish potpie, juice under a flaky crust. And a new kind of economy stretches your budget. In the first 
place you find that you save money right there at the store by buying more than enough for one meal. Quantity buying is 
always cheaper than buying in small, day-to-day amounts...Secondly, you save fuel by cooking those two pounds (of meat) at once...Then 
too, if you have the leftover habit, you can entertain with greater security and grace. You may buy more extravagantly for that 
special dinner because you know that you can make the family live on it and like it, for several days to come. Extra pounds or extra 
chops cease to be an extravagance and the party is more successful.None of that queasy feeling that the platter may be empty when it comes 
around the next time. And does there exist a family at least one member of which doesn't prefer cold ham to hot..." <br>

<a name="mangoes">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Mangoes</b></font><br>

What is a mango? Trick question. The answer depends upon context. In India, these juicy native fruits are deeply ingrained in both
culture and cuisine. <a href="foodfaq1.html#mangoglobal">Global diffusion</a> presents an interesting study in political economy.
 British ruling classes encountered mangos while stationed in <a href="foodfaq1.html#mangoanglo">India</a>. 
Recipes for "mock" mangos were created back home because the fruit did not thrive in northern climes. 
18th-19th century English "mangos" were essentially local pickle recipes inspired by Indian experience. Crafted to look like real
mangos, they were composed with common muskmelons, peaches, and cucumbers.
English settlers brought this dish to the <a href="foodfaq1.html#mangousa">American colonies</a>; adventurous New World cooks
added sweet peppers, small watermelons, and tomatoes to the mango menu.
<p>

<a name="mangofruit">
<b>Fruit of the mango tree</b><br>
"The hills of north-eastern India adjoining Myanmar are the likely centre of origin of the mango. Wild varieties still exist there, besides several other 
related species. In fact the amrataka, even now called the wild mango but belonging to a closely related species, Spondia pinnata, is also 
mentioned in the Brhadaranyaka Samhita. In Tamil, the fruit is called manga, or man-kai...The Tamil word manga was first used in a European 
tongue in AD 1510 by Varthema...the current term mango [was used] for the first time in AD 1673...Grafting was first used on the mango by the
 Portuguese...Mughal patronage also played a notable part in encouraging mango grafting. Noblemen could have all their revenues remitted by 
raising orchards. mangoes of high quality were collected from all over India and grown by Muqqarab Khan in his garden in Kirana...Down the
 centuries, the selection of a superior variety that arouse spontaneously, and its later perpetuation by grafting, let do nearly a thousand varieties 
of mango." <br>

<p>
<a name="mangocook">
<b>Culinary applications</b><br> 
"Two types are distinguished, one with firm flesh for table use, and the other...with ample...juice..The mango fruit has been utilized in different
 ways. The ripe fruit is of course eaten, and is reported in ancient Tamil literature as being served in restaurants...Wild ripe mangoes are cooked in 
curd in Kodagu to give a sweet-sour relish called mange-pajji, and are also cooked hole, including the seeds, to a sweetish curry. The sucking 
varieties can be 'drunk' by making a hole at the top and squeezing out the juice, and are particularly favoured for juice extraction in factories...
When the juice is dried in thin layers on bamboo mats the delicious chewy am-papad or ambsath is obtained, and a mango 'cheese' called 
mangada has been developed in Goa. Mangoes when green are tart, and have their appropriate outlets. meat cooked with mango pieces...fish
 curry cooked in coconut milk along with tiny pieces of green mango...Semi-ripe mangoes, boiled, pulped, strained and sugared, yield the delicious
 beverage now called mango-fool. Green mango is frequently ground into raw chutney...Pickles of unripe but tender mangoes abound...Wine made 
from ripe mango juice was termed sahakarasura by Charaka. in medical terms, the mango had the very strong connotation of a 'hot' food, which
 had necessarily to be imbibed along with 'cold' milk to avoid boils. Mango kernels are essentially starch, and have been pressed into servcie as a 
famiine food." <br>

<a name="mangomyth">

<b>Symbolism & mythology</b><br>
"Inevitably, myth and legend have accrued around the ancient mango tree. It is thought by some Hindus to be a transformation of Prajapathi 
himself, the progenitor of all creatures. Buddhists consider it sacred because the Buddha was accustomed to rest in a mango grove gifted to him 
by an admirer. On another occasion, the Buddha ate a mango fruit, planted the stone and washed his hands over it: a beautiful white mango tree 
sprang forth bearing flowers and fruit; it was looked after carefully, as shown in a tender medallion sculpted in Bharhut. In one legend, form a 
mango fruit appeared a daughter of Surya, the sun god, who was recognized by a king as his wife from a previous birth. The long racemes bearing 
mango flowers symbolize the darts of Kamadeva, the god of love...The literary record is ancient. The Rigveda itself mentions saha, but whether
 this is the term sahakara used for the mango in later literature is uncertain. From its very first mention as amra in the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad
 (c. 1000 BC)...the virtues of the mango fruit have been extolled fro three thousand years." <br>

<b>Global diffusion</b><br>
"The mango was first made known to the outside world, it is said, by the Chinese traveler Hwen 
T'sang who visited India in the 1st century AD, after which cultivation of the mango generally spread eastwards...By the 
10th century AD cultivation of M. indica 
had spread as far west as Persia, where it stopped, although the Egyptian climate would have been suitable...From S. India the mango was spread by the 
Portuguese, who took it to Africa in the 16th century. It reached Brazil and the W. Indies in the 18th century, and 
Hawaii, Florida, and Mexico in the 19th century." <br>

"In the new world [mangoes] were first introudced into Brazil, for the seeds were brought thence to Barbados in the middle of the last century. A French
vessel was carrying some young trees from Bourbon to Saint Domingo in 1782, when it was taken by the English, who took them
to Jamaica, where they succeeded wonderfuly. When the coffee plantations were abandoned, at the time of the emancipation of 
the slaves, the mango, whose stones the [slaves] scattered everywhere, formed forests in every part of the islands, as these are now
valued for their shade and as a form of food."<br>

"Of the many new fruits the British encountered in India, it was the mango which most caught their fancy. Dr. John Fryer,
who went out to Persia and India with the East India Comapny in the 1670s and later wrote of his experiences (A New Account of 
East India and Persia, 1698), claimed the apples of the Hesperides were nothing but fables to a ripe mang...A sign of this esteem
was the proliferation of recipes in England in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries which sought to imitate the flavour of the
fruit. Predictably, there were dissenters...The English name comes from manga, a corruption by the Portuguese in Goa of the original
Tamil mankay. Such a juicy fruit as the mango was impossible to eat tidily, leading the British to jest that it was best eaten
in the bath. They would have been advised to adopt the Indian method, which is to knead the unpeeled fruit to a pulp, then cut the
top off the narrow end and suck the pulp out."<br>

<b>American mango recipes</b><br>
Our survey of American cookbooks confirm "mangoes" were popular dishes. They descend from <a href="foodfaq1.html#mangoanglo">English</a>
culinary traditions. Many 19th century cookbooks offer two or more recipes. Most specify the primary fruit or vegetable to be used (mango melon, peach mangos, etc.) in the title or 
recipe description. Some, curiously, are devoid of explanation. Mrs. Porter's <i>New Southern Cookery Book</i> c. 1871 
simply states: "Pickled Mangoes. Wash your mangoes and rub them until they are dry..." (p. 406). When details are omitted
from recipes it is generally assumed the cook already knew what to use. No need to restate the obvious. 
<a href="foodfaq2.html#pickledpeppers">Pickled Peppers</a> are similar in method and ingredient.
<p>
Contemporary readers sometimes stumble over 19th century American mangoes. In today's world where transportation  
transcends seasons and origins, we are used to finding exotic foods locally whenever we want them. Not so much in the
19th century. Fresh oranges and pineapples were prized, especially in the northern half of our country. Thin-skinned juicy
mangos are more challenging to transport. A careful student of history soon concludes our 19th century foremothers were
not using <a href="foodfaq1.html#mangofruit">fruit of the mango tree</a>. 
<p>
"Mangos--In English cookery, mango is mock pickled mangoes, for which the
 English had developed a taste through imports from India. By 1699, recipes for
 making  'Mango of Cucumbers' and one of walnuts appear in John Evelyn's 
 Acetaria: A Discourse of Sallets; all eighteenth-century writers included recipes
 using various fruits such as peaches and small green melons. The invariable stuffing was part of the masquerade."<br>

"Mangos. This popular nineteenth-century pickle traces its origin to India, to the true mango pickle, which is called befena
among the Parsees. The recipe became popular in England during the eighteenth century, msotly as a less expensive substitute for the real
imported article. The pickle was popularized in this country through English cookbooks. Cookbook writers often used the term
mango rather loosely in connection with any fruit or vegetables that could be successfully stuffed and pickled according 
to the recipe. "In Pennsylvania and western Maryland, mangoes were generally made with green bell peppers. In Tidewater Maryland, wehre the growing
season was longer and soil conditions were ideal for melon culture, muskmelons provided the most popular form of local mango...Like most
mango pickles, [Eliza Lea's] pickle was served as a condiment with roasts. At banquets, its was sometimes served as a seperate
salad course."<br>

[NOTE: This book also offers a recipe for Melon Mangoes.]
<p>

<b>[1890]<br>
"Melon Mangos. </b>Select small green watermelons or muskmelons. Remove a piece about an inch wide the whole length of the melon; from this
opening remove the seeds with a spoon, and scoop out the soft portion in the centre. Place this melon with the piece taken from it
 by tis side in a tub, and so continue until you have the desired quantity. Make a brine of salt and clear cold water, sufficiently
 strong to bear an egg; pour over the melons, cover, and stand away for twenty-four hours. Drain, keeping each piece carefully
with its own melon. Make a filling as follows: to every dozen melons two hard heads of cabbage chopped fine, add to it, siz white onions chopped, a pint of
nasturtiums, a teaspoonful of ground cinnamon, a teaspoonful of ground cloves, a tablespoonful fo black pepper, a tablespoonful of 
salt, and mix all well together. Fill this into the melons, press down firmly, put int he piece and tie with twinen. When all are thus
prepared, place them in a stone jar, cover with vinegar, and stand aside twenty-four hours, then place them in a porcelain-lined kettle, and simmer
gently a half hour, then place them back regularly into the jar, and cover with fresh, cold cider vinegar, add a cupful of nasturtiums
 or a few pieces of horse-radish (this is to prevent molding), and stand away over night. In the morning drain off the vinegar without
disturbing the mangoes. Bring the vinegar to boiling point, pour it again over the mangoes, and when cold, tie up, and keep in 
a cool, dry place. Cucumber mangoes are made in precisely the same manner.
<p>
<b>"Peach Mangos.</b>
Select large, freestone peaches. Put them in a stone jar and cover them with brine sufficiently strong to bear an egg, and let stand
forty-eight hours, then take them from the brine and throw them into cold water for twenty minutes. Wipe each one carefuly without breaking the
skin, and with a sharp silver knife remove a small piece from one side and extract the stone. Sprinkle the inside lightly with celery
seed. Have ready sufficient grated horse-radish, moistened with vinegar, to fill the peaches. As each peach is filled replace the
small piece taken from the side and sew it all around with strong white thread. Stand them in stone or glass jars, as closely together as
possible. To every five dozen peaches allow<br>
1 gallon of vinegar<br>
1 pound of brown sugar<br>
1/4 teaspoonful of cayenne<br>
Put the vinegar, sugar and cayenne into a porcelain-lined kettle, birng quickly to a boil, and immediately take off. Pour 
boilikng hot over the peaches. When cold, tie up. They will be ready for use in ten days, and are very good."
<p>
<b>"Pepper Mangoes.</b> Cut the tops from one dozen red and one dozen green peppers. RRemove the seeds and save the tops. Stand the peppers
upright in a tub; pUT a teaspoonful of salt in each one, cover with cold water, and soak twenty-four hours. Drain. Dut two large heads
of cabbage on a cabbage cutter, add to this one teaspoonful of ground cloves, one teaspoonful of ground allspice, four
teaspoonfuls of whole mustard and two tablespoonfuls of salt; mix thorougly. Stuff the peppers with this mixture. Put on the tops
 and tie tightly. Stand them upright in stone jars, and cover with cold vinegar.
<p>
<b>"Tomato Mangoes.</b> Select smooth, medium-sized green tomatoes. Gut from the top or stem end a pieces sufficiently large to allow the
removal of the seeds without breaking the tomato. Stand them upright in a tubs, and each top by the side of its corresponding tomato, and
finish preciesly the same as pepper mangoes. The flavor of tomato mangoes is improved by placing here and there in the jar a pepper
mango."<br>

"Sweet Mangoes.</b> Select young musk melons that are not larer than an orange. Make a brine strong enough to float an egg and let them
lie in it for two weeks. Stir them up gently once in a while. Soak them in fresh water for 2 days, changing the water each
day. Remove the seed, making a slit in each melon large enough to take them out. Soak for half an hour in cold water, put in a kettle of 
fresh grape leaves and a small piece of alum and let boil for 20 minutes. Drain and let boil in clear water for 10 minutes with fresh
grape leaves. Have ready a stuffing fo citron, raisins, currants, and preserved cherries, all chopped up. Use enough of the 
syrup from the cherries to hold the ingredients together. A little of the grated yellow peel of lemon may be used in the 
stuffing. Stuff emlons and sew up the slits. Bind around with soft cord and put in kettle with one-half pound of sugar to each
pound of fruit and enough water to make a syrup. Boil gently for 15 minutes. Let stand overnight. The next day make a 
syrup of one pound of sugar to each pound of fruit and drop the mangoes in. Let boil for 1/3 an hour then take the mangoes out, 
boil the syrup down a little--it should not be too thick--put the mangoes in jars and pour the syrup over. Cover closely."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Mashed potatoes</b></font><br>
Although <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/books/kiple/potatoes.htm">
  potatoes</a> are a *New World* food introduced to 16th century Europe by
  Spanish explorers, food historians generally credit the French for their cultivation and
  spread throughout Europe, some 150 years later. Antoine-Auguste Parmentier, an 18th
  century army pharmacist, is generally acknowledged as the first European to promote
  potatoes as an economical and healthy food. France was starving in the 1760s and the
  potato was easy to grow, cook, consume, digest AND (most of all) it was cheap. It wasn't
  long before potatoes were accepted by other countries and assimilated into their cuisines.
<p>
       18th century English and American cookbooks contain a variety of potato recipes.
  They typically boiled, added to soups/stews, baked in the fire, fried with butter, used for
  stuffing, and peeled then mashed with butter, milk, salt or sugar. Sometimes other
  ingredients were added to mashed potatoes (bacon, onions). Mashed potatoes could be
  eaten alone, in conjuction with other foods (shepherd's pie, colcannon) or fried and served
  on the side (potato pancakes). Mashed potato recipes were similar to other vegetable
  pottages, known from Medieval times.
<p>
       By the middle of the 19th century, the baked potato was a popular item sold on the
  streets of London by vendors. According to the food historians, it was during this time the
  potato gained acceptance by the middle class. By the end of the 19th century, the humble
  spud was elevated to the ranks of  haute cuisine and served by chefs in the finest
  restaurants. Enter potato souffle, croquettes, Lyonnaise, au Gratin and a la Bechamel. 
<a href="http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/smashed_potatoes/">Smashed potatoes</a> are an
American iteration, surfacing in the late 19th century. 
<p>
Mashed potatoes are repurposed in many ways they can be made into potato pancakes, dumplings, potato bread/rolls, 
Shepherd's pie topiing or fill gnocci. Riced potatoes (see next) give leftover mashed potatoes a different look and texture.]
<p>
The first recipes we find for serving mashed potatoes in their skins (or jackets, as they
  were called then) were printed in American cookbooks in the 1880s. It is not specified
  whether the skins are meant for decoration or intended for consumption. Curiously, the
  first recipes for stuffed baked potatoes had them standing on end, as opposed to cut
  lenghthwise as we do now. 
  <p>
  The oldest recipe we have for mashed potatoes is this from 1747:
  <blockquote>
 <b> "Mashed potatoes.</b><br>
  Boil your Potatoes, peel them, and put them into a Sauce-pan, mash them well: To two
  pounds of Potatoes put a Pint of Milk, a little Salt, stir them well together, take care they

<b>[1934]<br>
"Mashed potatoes</b><br>
The way you serve mashed potatoes shows whether or not you are an artist at the stove. Never serve watery mashed potatoes, nor 
should there be a lump of potato unmashed. Here's the way I cook and mash potatoes: First, remove every eye and black speck
 from the potatoes before boiling. Boil in covered pot. Start in cold water, and when water boils, turn flame low for a slow
boil. Boil fro 30 minutes, then drain ALL the water off and put the potatoes through a ricer. Rice them in the pot they were
boiled in. Then add a level tablespoon of butter to each 2 potatoes (4 tablespoons butter equals a 1/4 lb. pint). Then add a little milk. Place
the pot over a slow flame and beat the potatoes vigorously with a large spoon. The more you beat, the better your potatoes will
be. The amount of butter and milk to be used should be decided by the artist at the stove. Mashed potatoes prepared in this
way will reheat perfectly."<br>

20th century American cook books continued to offer recipes for "standard" mashed potatoes. They also begin to explore the
possibilities of using this malleable medium to create interesting accents. Think: meatloaf "iced" with mashed potatoes. Photo captions from Ruth Berolzheimer's <i>Culinary Arts Institute Encyclopedic
 Cookbook</i> [c. 1950] suggest: "Bake the meat loaf in a ring mould and fill the center with a snowy peak of mashed potoatoes,"
"Potato cups for holding the other vegetables may be made from mashed potatoes as well as fried," and "Either duchess or 
plain mashed potatoes piped around each planked pork chop gives the final touch of elegance." (p. 494-498).

Tangy, tasty, bitter & delicious. With a mysterious history to match!
<p>
<b>What is horseradish? </b><br>
"Horseradish (Armoracia rusticana)...A member of the cabbage family and a relative of the radish, horseradish...is sometimes called 'German mustard,' 
perhaps because its strong, biting flavor derives from mustard oils that are release when the tissue of the root is cut." <br>
---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kenneth F. Kiple & Kriemhild Conee Ornelas [Cambridge University Press:Cambridge] 
2000, Volume Two (p. 1787) 
<p>
<b>Where did horseradish originate? </b><br>
"The uncertainty about the place of horseradish in the ancient world is paralleled by a similar uncertainty about the 
place of its origin, difficult to determine now, since it has become naturalized all over the world. It has been 
attributed tot he Mediterranean area (<i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>); southeastern Europe and western Asia (<i>The Oxford Book of 
Food Plants</i>); western and southeastern Asia (<i>A Dictionary of English Plant Names</i>); the Orient (Larouse Gastronomique); 
southeastern Europe and Siberia (<i>Le Livre des Bonnes Herbes</i>); and now doubt other regions as well. It would be my own 
guess that horseradish originated not far from the area where it is appreciated today, Germany...Some of the first 
intimation that horserdadish was being cultivated, not simply gathered wild, in Europe (Cato's example had apparently been
 forgotten) came from Germany, and it seems to have spread from central Europe northward to Scandinavia and westward to 
England ain Renaissance times. The first mention of it in England as a food (it had been known there as a medicine since 
the thirteenth century) seems to have been made by a sixteenth-century herbalist who wrote that in Germany it was used to 
make 'a sauce to eate fish with and such like meates as we do mustarde.'"<br> 
---<i>Food: An Authoritative and Visual History and Dictionary of the Foods of the World</i>, Waverly Root [Smithmark Books:New York] 1980 (p. 186) 
<p>
<b>Horseradish in history</b><br> 
"The radish is worth its weight in lead, the beet its weight in silver, the horseradish its weight in gold. We have this assessment from no less 
an authority than Apollo, who himself received it from the Delphic oracle, which seems on this occasion to have expressed itself with 
unaccustomed clarity. Unfortunately, clarity is not characteristic of the ancient nomenclature of the horesradish and the plants closely 
related to it, so our translations of their names in modern times, even if the plants themselves have remained unchanged, are largely 
a matter of guesswork--especially when the persons who attempt to do the translating not only are not sure what the ancient 
words meant, but are not sure want the modern words mean either. Thus a French writer who informs us that the horseradish is 
pictured on Egyptian tombs of the XII dynasty is unconvincing, since it is evident that she has succumbed to an error common in 
France, that of using the word raifort correctly to mean the horseradish, Armoracia lapathifolia, but also incorrectly to designate the black winter 
radish, Raphanus satuivus var. nifer, in the belief that the two are identical... We must assume nevertheless that the
 Egyptians kenw the horseradish at least by the XIX dynasty, about 1500 B.C., that presumable date of the Exodus, if it is
 true that the horesradish (probably its leaves, which when young and tender a usable in salads) was, as we are potent 
old, one of the five bitter herbs which the Jews were enjoined to eat at Passover...The imprecision with whic the ancients 
themselves referred to several closely related plants (they seem to have made no clear distinction between the radish and 
the horseradish until Rutilius Pallandius did so in the fourth century A.D., plus our own doubts as to what their various
 terms really meant, have made it possible for some writers to assert that the horseradish was known in the ancient world 
only as a food and for others to say ithat it was known only as a medicine; for some to say that it was only gathered wild
 and for others to say that it was cultivated expressly for the table...Of horseradish, Pliny wrote that 'persons who have
 overeaten should take it as sharp as possible, and asthmatics should eat its seeds, roasted, or crusted with honey.' As 
a food,onions on it were divided. Cato, in his earliest of Roman agricultural treatises, thought it worth while to give 
directions for its cultivation, and it is granted proof of place in a wall painting which may still be seen at Pompeii 
today. Some held it in low esteem because it provided belching, while others consumed it copiously in winter for its 
warming qualities. Apicius thought it too bland, and proposed accompanying it with peppered wine, or that strongly 
flavored contiment, garum. Its juice was much used for cooking." <br>

<b>Culinary applications </b><br>
"Horseradish...has long been a favourite of British cuisine. In former centuries it was often scraped over oily fish, 
such as salmon or mackerel, a use to which it is still frequently put in other northern European countries, but 
horseradish sauce established itself early as the condiment to accompany beef: in 1669 the Closet of Sir Kenelm Digby 
Knight Opened gave a recipe involving grating the horseradish and adding vinegar and a little sugar to it. It was put to
 unexpceted uses, though: Samuel Pepys, in his diary for 16 September 1664, notes 'there met Mr Pargiter, and he would 
needs have me to drink a a cup of Horseradish ale, which he and o friend of his, troubled with the stone, have been 
drinking of.' The chef Alexis Soyer (<i>Culinary Campaign</i>, 1857) gives a mind-boggling fiery recipe of a 'Universal Devil's
 mixture' which partners horseradish with mustard, chillis, cayenne, and pepper." <br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 163)
<p>
"Traditionally, the root was peeled and grated in the home and served on the side with meats such as boiled beef. But grated horseradish 
became a commercial product in the first part of the nineteenth century. It was preserved in vinegar and bottled initially in brown 
bottles to disguise the turnip filler that was often included. In 1869...H.J. Heinz began his business at Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania, by 
packing processed horseradish in clear bottles. Today, horseradish is generally bottled in combination with vinegar and salt, blended into 
a cream sauce, or mixed with mustard to become Creole mustard." <br>

<a name="hushpuppies">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Hush puppies</b></font><br>
Hush puppies are a popular southern American twist on an ancient culinary theme. Thousands of
years ago Romans and Greeks made <a
href="foodfaq1.html#fritters"> fritters</a>: deep fried flour
mixed with milk, eggs, spices, and honey. These ancient cooks also sometimes coated their fish
and other meats with similar concoctions before frying. Presumably, the practice of cooking
leftover coating was one of sensibility and frugality. Were these scraps fed to hungry dogs to keep
them quiet? The ancient texts do not say.
<p>
"Modern" hush puppies are made with corn meal. Corn is a new world food adapated by old
world cooks. <a
href="foodfaq.html#cornbread">Corn bread, spoon bread, hoe
cakes, and corn dodgers</a> are all related to hush puppies. The primary difference? Cooking
method. We find several 18th and 19th century American recipes for fritter-type foods and fried
fish dredged in flour/corn meal and spices. They go by several names, none of them "hush
puppies."
<p>
It's unlikely we will ever find a definative account when it comes to the exact origin of the term
"hush puppies" because the food historians have yet to agree. The general concensus is that the
name  DOES have something to do with keeping dogs quiet. The place? The American deep
south. Catfish, frequently referenced in hush puppy lore, is a favorite in that region. In the larger
frame of culinary research, it is not uncommon for recipes often precede their popular names.
<p>
<b>This is what the food historians say on the subject:</b>
<p>
"Hush Puppy. A dumpling of cornmeal that is deep-fried, especially popular in the South. The
term appears in print for the the first time about 1915. Although unconfirmed, the common
assumption regarding the hush puppy's origin is that it dates from the period of scarcity following
the Civil War, when cooks would toss scraps of corn batter to hungry dogs with the words "Hush
Puppies!" But the <i>Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins</i> cites a Southern reader's
account that in the South the aquatic reptile called the salamander was often known as a "water
dog" or "water puppy"...These were deep-fried with cornmeal dough and formed into sticks, and,
so the account goes, they were called "hush puppies" because eating such lowly food was not
something a southern wife would want known to her neighbors."<br>
---<i>The Encyclopedia of American Food & Drink,</i> John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New
York] 1999 (p. 161).
<p>
"Hush Puppy, a small sausage-shaped fritter made from white cornmeal, milk, water, and chopped
onions, fried in fat which has been used for frying fish. Its origins are obscure, but it seems to
have originated in Florida before 1920. According to legend it was devised by hunters, who
would throw an occasional fritter to their hunting dogs to keep them quiet. However, public
outdoor fish frying sessions were common in Florida, and it is plausible to suppose that the hush
puppy came into being at these, whter or not it owes its name to the abitlity to quieten hungry
dogs."<br>
--- <i>The Oxford Companion to Food,</i> Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford]
1999(p. 390-391)
<p>
"Hush puppies seem to have originated in the day-long hunting and fishing expeditions popular
among Southern men a few generations ago. Cooking their catch over an open fire was part of
their enjoyment of the day...as a side dish they fried little cornmeal cakes in the pan they had used
for the fish, and when the meal was over the leftovers went to the tied-up, yelping dogs,
presumable with the cry "Hush, puppies." The name first appears in print in 1918, but probably
was used much earlier."<br>
---<i>Rare Bits: Unusual Origins of Popular Recipes,</i> Patricia Bunning Stevens [Ohio
University Press:Athens] 1998 (p. 139).
<p>
"Hush puppies--golden-brown puffs invented to shush up the barking puppies at an outdoor feast;
made by putting corn-bread batter into deep fat." <br>
---<i>American Heritage Cookbook,</i> American Heritage [American Heritage:New York]
1964 (p. 128)
<p>
"The origin of hush puppies sounds like an urban legend, but the same explanation pops up again
and again in cookbooks, as well as in the <i>Encyclopedia of Southern Culture</i>. Back in the
day, the dudes who were gathered around the campfire for a fish fry would take the cornmeal
leftover from preparing catfish, fry it up in little balls and toss 'em to the dogs tosilence their
whining. Get it? Hush, puppies." <br>

<a name="millet">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Millet</b></font><br>
Millet has been consumed by humans from prehistoric times to present. General notes here:
<p>
"The general name used for many similar cereals, notably of the genus Panicum. These bear small
grains, yielding a coarse flour. They have been and in many places still are important staple foods,
especially in dry, hot regions...Millets vary in flavour from thoroughly palatable to bitter and upleasant.
Many are grown mainly or exclusively as fodder crops for animals or poultry. Since most of them have
many alternative common names the only clear way to list them is by their botanical names. Panicum
miliaceum is known as common, hog, or Indian millet, or as proso...or as broomcorn...This species
originated in the Near East, where it has been cultivated since prehistoric times. By the beginning of the
third millennium BC it had spread through Asia to China where...it was one of the sacred  five
grains...which were ceremonially sown by the emperor and his family...Common millet arrived in
Europe before 200 BC. It was a staple food known to the ancient Greeks as kenkhros and to the Romans
as milium (whence modern names). It was used for porridge and rough, unleavened bread."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 506)
<p>
"Millet, a general English name for cereals not belonging to the genera of wheat, barley, rye and oats.
None of the millets were favourite crops in the classical Mediterranean; the best known in Greece and
Rome was broomcorn millet. This had been domesticated, probably in the region of the Caucasus, before
5000 BC. It spread both westwards to central Europe (it was being cultivated in eastern France before
4000BC) and eastwards to China. It was known in Greece and Italy by the late prehistoric times. It must
have been a convenient crop in certain special circumstances, since it will ripen in Mediterranean lands
even if planted as late as the second half of June. Millet was made into a kind of porridge."<br>
---<i>Food in the Ancient World from A to Z</i>, Andrew Dalby [Routledge:London] 2003 (p. 218)
<p>
"Though people in the United States and Europe today generally think of millet as fodder for horses, millet is an important
staple grain for poor people in much of Asia, Russia, and western Africa, just as it was for Europeans though the Middle Ages. Like
other staple grains, millet represented the earth's nourishment and the harvest. In southern Europe, people cultivated millet
extensively as an alternative to oats and barley. It grew prolifically and produced astounding supplies. In China, millet had 
special significance because it required the earliest sowing and yielded the earliest harvest of any grain crops. The Chinese
have worshipped the spirits of millet and of the soil since ancient times. Becuase they believed that this
precious grain ensured their survival on earth, they used millet and millet wine ceremonially in the ritual sacrifices. The myths
and believes surrounding millet closely parallel the myths and beliefs about other staple grains. These tales recount
the supernatural origin of the crops and attempt to explain how people on earth received these divine gifts...Although in western 
Europe it was generally the poor who consumed millet, some Europeans belived that whoever ate the grain on New Year's Day would become
rich."<br>

<p>
"Romans considered oats to be suitable only for animals, while millet and panicum were commonly used
for porridge. Millet continued to figure as a staple for the poor up thorugh the Middle Ages, usually in
soups."<br>

Taylor Simeti [University of Chigago Press:Chicago] 1992 (p. 16)

"8. On Italian Millet. Italian millet and almost all leguminous plants are considered of bad juice. As
Pliny says, Italian millet [panicum] is so called because it is wrapped in paniculae [little tufts]. Aquitania
especially uses Italian millet, while the Pontic race prefers no food to it, and the region around the Po
also abounds in it. When Italian millet is ground and used in food, alone, it constricts the stomach, but
cooked with milk, it is very nourishing.
9. On Millet. Millet and Italian millet deplete the earth and for this reason should not be sown among
vines or fruit trees. The Ethiopians know no other grain than millet and barely, while Campania also
rejoices in it. It is cleaned by mortar and pestle, as are many others. Country people call its chaff apulda.
From millet is made porridge and very sweet bread, which the people this side of the Alps, and especially
the northern Italians, use. The principle use of millet is kneaded with must is for leaven, since it lasts a
year. The use of millet is considered inferiour to Italian millet, for it is dry and cold and slowly digested
and nourishes badly."<br>
