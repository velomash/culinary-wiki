"Here is a drink which can be served any time of the day or evening, when something refreshing is on order. This drink and the sunrise
in the morning are the only sure things they count on in Tahiti. I think it was invented to cure the cafard (Loss of one's mind from the heart.]"
<blockquote>
2 1/2 ounces dark Jamaica or Martinique rum (Red Heart or Myers's, or Rum Negrita)<br>
1/4 ounce Pernod or Herbsaint<br>
1/2 ounce lemon juice<br>
1/4 ounce pomegranate syrup (or grenadine)<br>
1 lime<br>
1/2 teaspoon sugar<br>
Charged water<br>
Add liquid ingredeints to crushed ice in shaker. Cut limes in half and squeeze into shaker, dropping in the shells; add sugar. Shake
well; pour the whole mess into a 12-ounce chimney glass; fill rest of glass with charged water and decorate with fruit or freshly
picked geranium leaf." (p. 54)

"I don't know who originated this one, but every bar in the West Indies serves it, practically every rum recipe booklet gives a
formula for it, so my little collection of rum drinks would hardly be complete withojut it. Such popularity must be deserved, and it 
is. It's a swell drink!
<blockquote>
1/2 lime<br>
1 teaspoon sugar<br>
Mint leaves<br>
2 ounces Puerto Rican Rum (Ron Merito, Boca Chica, or Brugal)<br>
Charged Water<br>
Squeeze lime and drop shell in 10-ounce glass; add sugar to juice, add mint leaves, and fill glass with shaved ice. Pour rum over
ice and swizzle. Add dash of charged water." (p. 57)

"There's a good story about this drink, but sitting here trying to remember it, I'm stuck. I know I got the drink from some
place, because I still have the scrap of paper I scribbled it down on...Anyway, I've served it for many years here in my little
saloon to the satsifaction of those who want a good drink without too great alcoholic strength.
<blockquote>
2 dashes Angostura bitter<br>
1/2 ounc Triple Sec (De Kuyper or Nuyens)<br>
1 ounce Puerto Rican Rum (Ron Merito or Brugal)<br>
2 tablespoons crushed pineapple<br>
1/2 ounce lemon juice<br>
1 scant teaspoon sugar<br>
Fill 10-ounce glass with shaved ice; add two dashes of bitters. Shake rest of ingredients and pour over shaved ice. Insert bar 
spoon without stirring so bitters are not completely mixed in drink. Decorate with maraschino cherry." (p. 56)

"Here's my idea of a killer-diller. Why people drink then I don't know, but I'll bet you make one before you throw this book 
away, and I'll bet you drink more of these than ony other drink in the book. Don the Beachcomber originated the drink and since then therer have been as many
different formulas as there are for Planter's Punch. Here's a simplified version for home use.
<blockquote>
1 ounce Jamaica rum (Red Heart or Myers's)<br>
2 ounces Puerto Rican rum (Ron Merito or Brugal)<br>
1/2 ounce Demerara 151 proof (Lemon Heart)<br>
1 ounce orange curacao (De Kuyper or Nuyens)<br>
1 ounce lemon juice<br>
1 ounce orange juice<br>
1/2 ounce grenadine<br>
1 dash Pernot or Herbsaint<br>
Put ingredients in a large mixing blass with a large piece of ice; stir well and pour over cracked ice ina 14-ounce chimney
glass. This drink may also be made in large quantities for use in punch bowls. Oh-ho, what a party that'll be! Personally, I think it's too 
damn strong but people seem to like it that way." (p. 70-71

<font color="#003366" size="+1"><b>Fish House Punch</b></a></font><br>
"...Classic among punches, Fish House Punch is our oldest formula, reeking with tradition and vaporizing visions of
George Washington, Lafayette, and the 'Spirit of '76.' Roll out the drums!
<blockquote>
1 pound brown sugar<br>
1 quart lemon juice<br>
2 quarts Jamaica rum<br>
1 quart cognac <br>
2 ounces peach brandy<br>
2 quarts water<br>
Slack sugar in punch bowl; when completely dissoved add lemon juice and let stand. Combine rest of ingredients and let stand in separate container.
Two hours before serving time, combine lemon juice mixture and liquor in punch bowl with large cake of ice and let chill to acquire
proper dilution. In winter, when ice melts slowly, more water may be used, but in warm weather the melting ice will dilute the
mixture sufficently." (p. 78-79)

<b>Trader Vic's books</b><br>
Victor Bergeron capitalized on Trader Vic's name by publishing several home cook books and professional bartending guides. The books are well written,
entertaining and practical. The Food Timeline Library owns <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/364721269794160216/">
these titles</a>:
<ul>
<li><i>Frankly Speaking: Trader Vic's Own Story, A Candid and informal autobiography</i> [1973]<br>
...Fascinating insight of Trader Vic's empire by the man who built it. Includes restaurant photos, selected recipes & index.
Perfect beach reading.
<li><i>Trader Vic's Bartender's Guide</i> [1947]<br>
...The first three chapters offer sage professional advice to the bartending staff: "Phonies, check-dodgers or the perils of 
bartending," 
"People that bartenders have learned not to like," & "Bartenders that customers don't like." 
<li><i>Trader Vic's Bartender's Guide</i>, revised [1972]<br>
...updated cocktails for the next generation of exotic imbibers.
<li><i>Trader Vic's Book of Food and Drink</i> [1946]<br>
...Trader Vic's first book was an overnight sensation. Just enought exotic flair not to scare the average American. 
Includes instructions for a holding a <a href="fooddecades.html#40luau">
luau at home</a> for trendy American party hostesses.
<li><i>Trader Vic's Book of Mexican Cooking</i> [1973]<br>
...embellishing the Pacific Island book on publisher Doubleday's request. Timing is everything.
<li><i>Trader Vic's Helluva Man's Cookbook</i> [1976] <br>
...The book bills itself as "No-nonsense easy-to-cook timesaving recipes for men who like to cook." Some of these recipes 
are rather complicated. The headnotes are breezy and hilarious "Vegetables are usually boring. Jeezus, they don't even look like much on your plate." (p. 80, recipe is for
Broccoli Puffs).
<li><i>Trader Vic's Kitchen Kibitzer</i> [1952]<br>
...Practical advice for the average American housewife who yearns to entice her man with good food. About cookbooks, Mr. Bergeron writes 
"Don't ever stop buying cookbooks. One good idea is worth the price you 
paid for the book. If you get one good recipe from a cookbook you've been amply rewarded for the time and money invested. After all, 
you'd pay a couple of bucks outright for a good recipe, wouldn't you? You'll pay that much for one mediocre meal, but a good recipe is
yours forever." (p. 9)
<li><i>Trader Vic's Pacific Island Cookbook</i> [1968] <br>
...Expanding the orignal 1946 book with chapters on Polynesia, Japan, Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, Mexico, Texas and Home Port (California).
Drink recipes focus on San Francisco, eye openers, after dinner libations, signature tropical drinks & punch.
