<a name="salad"
<b>What is salad?</B><br>
Food historians tell us salads (generally defined as mixed greens with dressing) were enjoyed by
ancient Romans and Greeks. As time progressed, salads became more complicated. Recipes
varied according to place and time. Dinner salads, as we know them today, were popular with
Renaissance folks. Composed salads assembled with layers of ingredients were enjoyed in the
18th century. They were called <a href="foodsalads.html#salmagundi">Salmagundi</a>. Today they are called chef's salad. 
<p>
<b>Why do we call it salad? </b><br>
The basis for the word salad is 'sal', meaning salt. This was chosen because in ancient times, salt was often an ingredient in the dressing. Notes here: 
<p>
"Salad, a term derived from the Latin sal (salt), which yielded the form salata, 'salted things' such as the raw vegetables eaen in classical times with a dressing of oil, 
vinegar or salt. The word turns up in Old French as salade and then in late 14th century English as salad or sallet." <br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford Univeristy Press:Oxford] 2nd edition, 2006 (p. 682)
<p>
"Etymologically, the key ingredient of salad, and the reason for its getting its name, is the dressing. The Romans were enthusiastic eaters of salads, many of their 
differing hardly at all from present-day ones--a simple selection of raw vegetables...--and they always used a dressing of some sort: oil, vinegar, and often brine. And hence
 the name salad, which comes from Vulgar Latin Herba salata, literally 'salted herb'." <br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 294) 
<p>
Etymological notes & historic uses, Oxford English Dictionary: <br>
<b>"Salad </b><br>
[a. OF. salade (14th c.), a. Pr. salada = OIt. salata, Pg. salada (cf. It. insalata, Sp. ensalada): ta, f. *sal and cf. quot. 1687 s.v. SALADING. 
 c1390 Forme of Cury (1780) 41 Salat. Take persel, sawge, garlec [etc.]..waische hem clene..and myng hem wel with rawe oile, lay on vyneger and salt, and serue it
 forth."
<p>
"Although the ancient Greeks and Romans did not use the world "salad," they enjoyed a variety
of dishes with raw vegetables dressed with vinegar, oil, and herbs...The medical practitioners
Hippocrates and Galen belived that raw vegetables easily slipped through the system and did not
create obstructions for what followed, therefore they should be served first. Others reported that
the vinegar in the dressing destroyed the taste of the wine, therefore they should be served last.
This debate has continued ever since...With the fall of Rome, salads were less important in
western Europe, although raw vegetables and fruit were eaten on fast days and as medicinal
correctives...The term salade derived from the Vulgar Roman herba salata, literally  'salted herb'.
It remained a feature of Byzantine cookery and reentered the European menu via medieval Spain
and Renaissance Italy. At first "salad" referred to various kinds of greens pickled in vinegar or
salt. The word salade later referred to fresh-cooked greens of raw vegetables prepared in the
Roman manner."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of Food and Culture</i>, Solomon H. Katz, editor and William Woys
Weaver, associate editor [Charles Scribner's Sons:New York] 2003, Volume 3 (p. 224-5)<br>
[NOTE: This book contains far more information than can be paraphrased here. Ask your
librarian to help you find a copy.]
<p>
At the tail end of the 19th century (in the United States) the domestic science/home economics
movement took  hold. Proponnents of this new science were obsessed with control. They
considered tossed plates of mixed greens "messy" and eschewed them in favor of "orderly
presentations."  Salad items were painstakenly separated, organized, and presented. Molded
gelatin (Jell-O et al) salads proliferated because they offered maximum control.
<p>
"Salad greens, which did have to be served raw and crisp, demanded more complicated measures.
The object of scientific salad making was to subdue the raw greens until they bore as little
resemblance as possible to their natural state. If a plain green salad was called for, the experts
tried to avoid simply letting a disorganized pile of leaves drop messily onto the plate...This
arduous approach to salad making became an identifying feature of cooking-school cookery and
the signature of a refined household...American salads traditionally had been a matter of fresh
greens, chicken, or lobster, but during the decades at the turn of the century, when urban and
suburban middle class was beginning to define itself, salads proliferated magnificently in number
and variety until they incorporated nearly every kind of food except bread and pastry...Salads that
were nothing but a heap of raw ingredients in dissaray plainly lacked cultivation, and the cooking
experts developed a number of ingenious ways to wrap them up...The tidiest and most thorough
way to package a salad was to mold in in gelatin."<br>
---<i>Perfection Salad: Women and Cooking at the Turn of the Century</i>, Laura Shapiro
[North Point Press:New York] 1986 (p. 96-99)
<p>
Culinary evidence confirms salads of all kinds were very popular in America in the 1920s. Entire
books were devoted to the topic. Some of the more popular were:<ul>
<li><i>The Edgewater Beach Hotel Salad Book</i>, Arnold Shircliffe [Hotel Monthly
Press:Evanston] 1926
<li><i>Bettina's Best Salads and What to Serve With Them</i>, Louise Bennett Weaver & Helen
Cowles LeCron [A.L.Burt:New York] 1923
<li><i>Fancy Salads of the Big Hotels</i>, Henri Kegler [Tri-Arts:New York] 1923
<li><i>Salads and Sandwiches</i>, Originated and Published in Woman's World Magazine
[Woman's World:Chicago] 1924
</ul>
<p>
Eventually, the hold of domestic science relaxed and tossed salads once again found their way on
American tables. <a href="foodsalads.html#tossed">Tossed salads</a> regained favor. Today, American
salads range from the uninspired classic" lettuce wedge, tomato & cucumber doused with bottled
dressing to tantalizing creations composed of interesting greens, asian fruits and vegetables, crisp
noodles lightly tossed with sesame seed soy sauce. Lettuce-free salads (tomato and fresh mozzerlla) and exotic fruit combinations
(kiwi, mango, strawberry) are found in upscale restaurants and suburban supermarket salad bars. Busy home cooks have the option of
assembling "salad in a bag" adorned with ready-cut veggies (broccoli, cauliflower), baby carrots, tiny tomatoes, and packaged crunchies
(flavored croutons, nuts, mini crackers, onion crisps). No cutting involved.

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Candle salad</b></font><br>

The ingredients and presentation of classic Candle Salad (aka Candlestick, Candlette, Night Cap) suggest it was a dish of the 1920s. That is when 
creative <a href="foodsalads.html#fruitsalad">fruit salads</a> of all sorts were created and pineapples were actively promoted to American cooks. Our survey of historic newspapers 
confirms does not reveal any specific person/place/company credited for the "invention." If we had to guess? We'd say Dole, manufacturer of 
both pineapples and bananas, was the driving force behind this item. Think: <a href="foodcakes.html#pineapple">
Pineapple Upside Down Cake</a>.  Bananas were widley availble to American cooks from the <a href="foodcakes.html#bananacook">1880s</a> forward. 
Coinicidentally, <a href="foodfaq.html#maraschino">Maraschino cherries</a> were also introduced in the 1920s.
<p>
Candle salad, a relatively simple and inexpensive combination, was generally promoted as a 
festive holiday dish for its unusual presentation. It was recommended for Christmas, Halloween and children's birthday parties.
The earliest print reference we find for Candle Salad is dated 1916. It was presented in this socialite menu; no description or recipe included:
"Fruit Cocktail, Chicken a la King, Mashed Potatoes, Buttered Peas, Rolls, Olives, Candle Salad, Cheese Straws, Fancy Cakes, Nut Ice Creams, 
Candies and Nuts, Coffee."---<i>Oelwein Daily Register</i> [IA] April 5, 1916 (p. 4)
<p>
By the end of the decade, Candle Salad was being promoted as a time-honored tradition on par with Santa and is reindeer. Print evidence fails
to substantiate the claim. Notice how the recipes grow more complicated as the decade progresses.

one end of a slender short banana. Stick the unbroken end in the hole in the center of the pineapple slice, shaving off a little of the banana to 
make it stand secure. Pour some thick mayonnaise on top of and down one side of the banana to represent melted wax, and put a Maraschino 
cherry on top for the burning wick. Soak a strip of celery in hot water to make it pliable and make the handle of it, or use a strip of orange peel. 
Surround pineapple with tiny lettuce leaves or mayonnaise pressed through the pastry tube."<br>

"Probably millions of recipes are invented each year. Most of them are used only by the composer and  few friends or neighbors, others manage to 
creep into recipe and cook books and live for a number of years, but here and there a recipe is composed that seems to live forever. The old
 Christmas Candle Salad has been so popular for so many generations that at this time of year it is as much entitled to appear in print once more 
as is the story of Santa and his famous reindeer. 
<p>
"A crisp leaf of lettuce is placed upon a salad plate; a thick slice of seedless orange tops it; a peeled banana cut in two horizontally, is placed 
upon the center of the orange slice; a maraschino cherry or some other red tasty tops the banana--and there you have the principal ingredients. 
The orange slice is the candlestick, the banana the candle, and the cherry the flame. A mound of red jelly at the base of the candle and a 
suitable 
thick dressing (flavored whipped cream is delicious) poured over the banana at the last minute to represent the flowing wax--and the never-dying 
Christmas candle salad is again ready for the Christmas meal."<br>---"A Christmas Candle Salad," <i>Philadelphia Tribune</i>, December 20, 1928 (p. 5)

<a name="chefsalad">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Chef's salad</b></font><br>
Food historians can't quite agree on the history and composition of chef's salad much less who
assembled the first one. Some trace this salad's roots to <a href="foodsalads.html#salmaguni">Salmagundi</a>, a popular meat and salad
dish originating in 17th century England and popular in colonial America. Others contend chef's
salad is a product of early twentieth century, originating in either New York or California.  The Brown Derby's popular 
<a href="foodsalads.html#cobb">Cobb Salad</a> might have provided inspiration.
The
person most often connected with the history of this salad is Louis Diat, chef of the Ritz Carleton
in New York City during the 1940s. While the food historians acknowledge his recipe they do not
appear to be convinced he originated the dish. Here are some of the popular theories:
<p>
"The evolution of Chef's Salad
What chef dreamed up this salad? Food historian Evan Jones says in his headnote to Chef's Salad recipe in 
<i>American Food: The Gastronomic Story</i> (1975): "The origin
of this salad is not, apparently, a matter of record, but it may have been made first in the kitchen
of the Ritz-Carleton where a recipe used by Louis Diat called for smoked ox tongue as one of the
meats and watercress as the only green leaf." Louis Diat includes this recipe in Cooking a la Ritz
(1941):<blockquote>
    <b>'Chef's salad.</b> Place separately in a salad bowl equal amounts of chopped lettuce (place
on the bottom of the bowl), boiled chicken, smoked ox tongue and smoked ham, all cut in julienne
style. Add 1/2 hard-cooked egg for each portion. Place some watercress in the center and serve
with  French Dressing.'</blockquote>
     A year earlier, Edith Barber, food editor of the <i>New York Sun</i> offered...[a recipe for]
Chef's Salad in <i>Edith Barber's Cook Book</i> (1940). Her recipe differs significantly from
Chef Louis's and like him, she doesn't say where she obtained the recipe. The original Chef's Salad
was..."diet fare," which lends credence to Mariani's theory that it comes from California...Over
time chef's salads became fancier, weightier..."<br>
---<i>American Century Cookbook: The Most Popular Recipes of the 20th Century</I>, Jean
Anderson [Clarkson Potter:New York] 1997 (p. 270-271)
<p>
"The chef's salad is a familiar yet fading star in the salad world...this still-beloved salad may have
had a noble beginning. Though nobody has ever stepped forward to claim the title of the chef in
'chef's salad,' the dish has been attributed by some food historians to Louis Diat, the chef of the
Ritz-Carton in New York City in the early 1940s...The concept of the chef's salad dates still
earlier; one seventeenth-century English recipe for a 'grand sallet' calls for lettuce, roast meat, and
a slew of vegetables and fruits."<br>
---One-Dish Dinners: A New Chef's Salad, <i>Gourmet</i>, August 1999 (p. 100).
<p>
<a name="salmagundi">
<b>"Salmagundi</b><br>
A dish composed of chopped meat, anchovies, eggs, onions with oil and condiments."<br>
---<i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, 2nd edition, Volume XIV (p. 399)<br>
[1674: Blount...a dish of meat made of cold Turkey and other ingredients.]
<p>
"Salmagundi. a term dating back from the 17th century...In writing about salads of the 17th
century, C. Anne Wilson (1973) explains the term thus: 'Sometimes an egg and herb salad was
further enhanced by the addition of cold roast capon, anchovies and other meat or fish delicacies.
Late in the 17th century the name of salmagundi was applied to mixtures of this type, and was
subsequently corrupted to  Solomon Gundy.' Hannah Glasse (1747) has three recipes for
Salamongundy, but sums up the essence of this dish at the end of the third recipe: 'but you may
always make a Salamagundy of such things as you have, according to your Fancy.'"<br>

<p>
The famous 1926<i> Edgewater Beach Hotel Salad Book</i>, Arnold Shircliffe (we have a 1955
12th printing copy) contains a salad recipe titled "Chef's Special." (p. 43) It is a far cry from what
we know today as chef's salad. It is composed of romaine, endive, grapefruit, pineapple, olives,
cream cheese, pimentoes. This book also contains a recipe for Salmagundi (p. 170). Ingredients
are lettuce, cabbage, anchovies, chicken, hard-boiled egg yolks, parlsey, green beans. The earliest
recipe we have titled "Chef's Salad" in an American cookbook was published in 1936.

"Chef Salad" is a generic recipe for a modern composed salad. There are many variations. 
The best way to examine the difference between these two dishes are checking recipes for both published in the same book. What better example than the Brown Derby's 
own cookbook? 
<blockquote>
<b>"Cobb Salad, serves 4-6 </b><br>
1/2 head of lettuce <br>
1/2 bunch watercress <br>
1 small bunch chicory <br>
1/2 head romaine <br>
2 medium-sized tomatoes, peeled <br>
2 breasts of boiled roasting chicken <br>
6 strips crisp bacon <br>
1 avocado <br>
2 hard-cooked eggs <br>
2 tbs. chopped chives <br>
1/2 cup fine grated imported Roquefort cheese <br>
1 cup Brown Derby Old-Fashioned French Dressing <br>
Cut finely lettuce, watercress, chicory, and romaine and arrange in salad bowl. Cut tomatoes in half, remove seeds, dice finely, and arrange in a strip across the salad.
 Dice breasts of chicken and arrange over top of chopped greens. Chop bacon finely and sprinkle over the salad. Cut avocado in small pieces and arrange around the edge 
of the salad. Decorate the salad by sprinkling over the top the chopped eggs, chopped chives, and grated cheese. Just before serving mix the salad throughouly with
 French Dressing." <br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Chicken salad</b></font><br>
Culinary evidence (old cookbooks, menus etc.) confirms minced cooked meat and mayonnaise-type salads were popular in America from
colonial times present. These were culinary traditions brought to our shores by European (especially German) settlers. Primary evidence
suggests early 19th century meat salads were composed as primary dishes, not a thrifty mode for repurposing leftovers. Of course,
cookbooks only tell part of the story. Thrifty cooks have been repurosing leftovers from ancient times forwards. 
Lobster,
chicken, ham, and mutton salads were popular in the mid-late 19th century. This correlates with the
aggressive promotion of household meat choppers. Coincidence? Probably not.
Twentieth century <a href="foodsalads.html#tuna">tuna salad</a> descends from this culinary tradition.

<blockquote>

<b>[1845] <br>
"Chicken Salad.</b><br>
The fowls for this purpose should be young and fine. You may either boil or roast them. They must be
quite cold. Having removed all the skin and fat, and disjointed the fowls cut the meat from the bones into very small
pieces, not exceeding an inch. Wash and split two large fine heads of celery, and cut the white part into pieces also about
an inch long; and having mixed the chicken and celery together, put them into a deep china dish, cover it and set it away.
It is best not to prepare the dressing till just before the salad is to be eaten, that it may be as fresh as possible. Have ready
the yolks of eight hard-boiled eggs. Put them into a flat dish, and mash them to a paste with the back of a wooden
spooon. Add to the egg a small tea-spoonful of fine salt, the same quantity of cayenne pepper, half a gill of made mustard,
a gill or a wine-glass and a half of vinegar, and rather more than two wine-glasses of sweet oil. Mix all these ingredients
thoroughly; stirring them a long time till they are quite smooth. The dressing should not be put on till a few minutes
before the salad is sent in; as by lying in it the chicken and celery will become tough and hard. After you pour it on, mix
the whole well together with a silver fork. Chicken salad should be accompanied with plates of bread and butter, and a
plate of crackers. It is a supper dish, and is brought in with terrapin, oysters, &tc. Cold turkey is excellent prepared as
above. An inferior salad may be made with cold fillet of veal, instead of chickens. Cold boiled lobster is very fine cut
up and drest in this manner, only substituting fore celery, lettuce cut up and mixed with the lobster."<br>

<b>[1865] <br>
"No. 90.--Turkey Salad. </b><br>
Cut some of the meat from a cold boiled or braised turkey in small pieces, and put them into a deep dish with four table-spoonfuls 
of good salad oil, and one and a half of vinegar, a small onion, a shallot, some parsley, green tarragon, and chervil, all chopped 
fine, and salt and pepper. Let the pieces of turkey soak in this for four hours, turning them occasionally, and covering the dish 
closely. Then put some well-dried and shred lettuce on a dish, take the pieces of turkey from the oil and vinegar, and arrange them in the 
centre of the lettuce. Take two raw yolks of eggs, beat them a little in a basin, and add by slow degrees the oil, vinegar, chopped 
herbs, etc., from which you have taken the turkey, stirring all the time till the sauce is quite smooth; taste it, and, if necessary, add more 
salt or pepper; pour this sauce over the turkey and salad; arrange round the edge, or in a pattern in the centre, as you like best, olives 
and slices of hard-boiled eggs alternately, and serve." <br>

boiled. Take off all the skin (some persons do not use the dark meat; it is quite as tender as the white, and when dressed,
does not show the difference); chop the meat very fine (be sure to take out good heads of tennis-ball lettuce into
quarters; wash it all clean, and lay it in ice-water for two or three hours, that it may be crisp). If celery is used, split it fine,
and put into ice-water as long as you would the lettuce, as it must be brittle to be good."<br>

and cut the white parts of celery into pieces abut a half inch long, throw them into a bowl of cold water, and also set them until
wanted. To every pint of chicken allow two thirds of a pint of celery and a cup and a half of mayonnaise dressing. When ready to serve, dry the celery and mix
with the chicken; dust lightly with salt, white pepper or cayenne, then mix it with the mayonnaise. Serve on a a cold dish, 
garnished with white celery tips. One cup of white cream may be added to every one-half pint of mayonnaise when ready to use

According to American food historian Sylvia Lovegren, Chinese ingredient-inspired salad/dressing originated in the 1930s. 
Our survey confirms several 1930s mainstream America recipes titled "Chinese Chicken Salad." They are a far cry from what Anerican
diners expect today. Our Chinese food history sources confirm raw salads were not tradtional fare in Asia. So unfolds another
delicious page in Chinese-American cuisine.
<p>
"Salad made with uncooked vegetables was not consumed in traditional China, for raw salads were dangerous and had little 
appeal to most Chinese; instead, Chinese salads were customarily made of parboiled or stir-fried vegetables and served 
with hot or cold."<br>---<i>Food in China: A Cultural and Historial Inquiry</i>, Frederick J. Simoons [CRC Press:Boca Raton FL] 1991 (p. 148)
<p>
"There are many different types of cold chicken salad in China, although most of them seem to originate in Szechwan. One of the most popular is pong pong 
(or bong bong) chicken, which is basically shredded chicken and bean sprouts dressed with a peanut butter, red pepper, and garlic sauce. But the Chinese chicken
 salad that was being consumed in such quantities by the fashionable set--probably among rising young record and film producers on the West Coast--probably
 orginated in California. This version is a cold mixture of shredded iceberg lettuce, crispy fried noodles, the strips of roasted chicken, all tossed with a slightly sweet
 sesame oil--tinged dressing made sprightly with flecks of hot red peppers. There is a similar chicken salad, known as so see chicken, made popular at Johnny 
Kan's restaurant in San Francisco, but Kan's version omits the fried noodles."<br>

Predictably, our early 20th century salad cookbooks [1900-1950s] offer several recipes for various "Oriental" Salads. The surprise? None of these recipes are similar
to the menu items we expect today. Neither did these books offer anything close to contemporary Asian/Oriental-style (sesame soy ginger) salad dressing. One recipe circa 1923 consisted of diced prunes, dates, figs, chopped nuts, diced pineapple topped with "One cup salad dressing."  These salads were generally topped with Vinaigrette or spiced mayonnaises. None of the examples we found included sesame, or ginger. Some did employ soy sauce.
Our survey of American newspapers confirms Chinese Chicken Salads were indeed popular in the 1930s. As one might expect, there were 
several variations for both salad and dressing. <a href="foodsalads.html#orientaldressing">Asian salads/dressings</a>, as we know them today, first surfaced in the mid-1960s. Articles confirm the popularity and 
diversity of this salad/dressing grew in subsequent decades. Asian-style salad dressings were promoted in the 1980s as healthier alternatives to traditional selections. 
Thai flavors are introduced in the 1990s. Today there are many variations on this ubiquitious recipe.

"Combine a taste of Chinese food and a taste for salads and it's inevitable that anyone who fancies both will eventually come across
the dish known as Chinese chicken salad. But one Chinese chicken salad can be as different from another Chinese chicken salad
as a pair of fraternal twins. This possibly could be because salads as the Western world knows them definately are not part of the
overall Chinese cuisine. Raw vegetables, simply don't play an important role in the meals of the Chinese. So where did the
first Chinese chicken salad appear? Who knows? It's likely, however, that today's many versions of Chinese chicken salad stem
from any number of cold shredded-chicken dishes that are indeed very much a part of Chinese cuisine. Whatever the origin, 
Chinese chicken salad is a popular menu item at numerous Chinese and non-Chinese restaurants. Some chefs depend on chow mein
noodles or rice sticks to provide a bit of crunchy texture in their salads, while other simply rely on a variety of tender
vegetables for a crispy touch. One thing hey have in common is that nearly all of these wonderful salads call for soy sauce, sesame
oil or seeds, ginger and other typical Chinese flavorings. Only a few of the most popualr versions call for exotic ingredients sude
as dried bean curd and black fungus. Whether these sometimes hot, sometimes cold dishes are true salads or not really doesn't
matter. They taste wonderful and that's all, really, that's important. A recent taste test on some of the chicken-salad recipes that
have found a home in <i>The Times</i> recipe files pointed out the wonderufl creativity possible when one chooses Chinese flavorings
to satisfy a craving for chicken salad. The spicy sweetness of hoisin sauce, for instance, turned the slaad form the Jade
West restaurant into an excellent light luncheon choice, while the salad from Le Grand Buffet with its accent on crisp vegetables
and delicate Sherry dressing would fill the bill nicely as a separate course or side-dish salad.<p>

mayonnaise, cider vinegar, and Dijon mustard. Less egregiously Western (though still high on the
cultural embarrassment scale) is a rendition I recently had -- believe it or not -- at California
Crisp in Stonestown Mall. Here, romaine lettuce was combined with chunks of chicken and
tossed with crispy noodle bits, bean sprouts, water chestnuts, and slivered almonds in a tangy-sweet vinaigrette. And at the opposite end of the spectrum is ...cold chicken noodle salad.
Blessedly, the menu simply lists this sublime dish as "cold noodle salad." ...To be fair, other than
being chilled, this dish is about as close to an Applebee's Chinese chicken salad as clam chowder
is to bouillabaisse. For one thing, it actually has origins in China, though it's no doubt been
dumbed down a bit for American tastes. For another, no actual lettuce is used in the making of
this salad. It begins with cold linguine-width rice-flour noodles, on which are piled hand-shredded roast chicken, scallions, and cucumber slivers sprinkled with crushed peanuts. The
whole thing is tossed in a dressing -- really more of a sauce -- that combines sesame oil, peanut
butter, chicken broth, ginger, garlic, red chili, and rice vinegar in a wonderfully light and tangy
blend that's spicy enough to make you sweat and cold enough to keep you from overheating."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>French dressing & Vinaigrette</b></font><br>
In France, oil & vinegar dressings are called vinaigrette. The term "French dressing" (used to
denote vinaigrette and its many variations) became popular in Britain and America in the late 19th century.
The <a href="foodsalads.html#tomatofrench">tomato-based French dressing</a> we Americans currently purchase in grocery stores probably
also began in the twentieth century.
<p>
<b>Why two names for the same dressing?</b><br>
"Vinaigrette...The word, which originated as a diminutive form of French vinaigre (vinegar), was
first used in English as long ago as 1699 (John Evely mentioned it in his book on salads, Acetaria)
but it did not really become established until the end of the nineteenth century. French dressing,
which originated around 1900, is a widely used synonym in British English. In French, vinaigrette
was also applied formerly to a sort of small two-wheeled carriage, from a supposed resemblance
to a vinegar-seller's cart."<br>

"Vinaigrette. A cold sauce made from a mixture of vinegar oil, pepper, and salt, to which various
flavourings may be added...Vinaigrette is used especially for dressing green salads...It is considred
to be a typically French sauce and is often called "French dressing" in Britain. It was a French
emigre, Chevalier d'Albingac, who started the fashion in London high society for salads dressed

<b>Tomato-based French dressings (USA)</b><br>
Only in America? Could a convenience dressing like this happen. Arnold Shircliffe's <i>Edgewater Beach Hotel Salad Book</i>
[1928] offers two samples. In the orange version he adds the word "obesity" without comment. The red version features
tomato ketchup. Both are creamy and sweet. In period context, these dressings make perfect sense. Prohibition recipes
were generally sweeter than those of the previous generation.
<p>
We Boomers remember the tangy sweet flavor of
 this creamy brilliant orange dressing. For many of us, it was the only dressing we liked. Growing up, oil & vinegar dressings were
called "Italian." Vinaigrette is a pleasant revelation to us.
<p>
"Like salads, salad dressings metamorphised this century. There were new additions: Green
Goddess, Thousand Island, Russian, Roquefort, ranch. But the bottling of dressings had greater
impact. Hellmann's creamy "deli-style" mayonnaise went into the jar in 1915--a landmark...Kraft
played a pivotal role early on, too, with a slim but select repetoire of bottled dressings including
the ever popular Miracle Whip and coral-colored French dressing. Busy cooks loved these
"convenience" dressings. In fact many considered them superior to anything they themselves
could make....Family French dressing...This is the dressing most of us grew up on. And until
Julia Child
taught us how to make vinaigrette in the 1960s, it was the one we ladled over wedges of iceberg
or tossed with mixed greens."<br>

Cobb Salad, as we know it today, was introduced by Bob Cobb, owner of the Brown Derby restauarant in Los Angeles 
California sometime in the late 1920s.
An amalgam of interesting greens, meat, cheese, and eggs, this dish descends from 17th century <a href="foodsalads.html#salmagundi">Salmagundi</a>.
1940s <a href="foodsalads.html#chefsalad">Chef's salad</a> may have been inspired by the Cobb.
<p>
"During the first four years the original Little Hat Derby added only two items to its menu--a salad and a 
<a href="foodcakes.html#chiffoncake">cake</a>. The salad was almost an accident.
Bob Cobb, growing weary of the steady hot-dog-hamburger diet, found an avocado in the icebox. He chopped it up, along with some lettuce,
celery, and tomatoes, plus a strip of bacon and some salad dresing, and had that for his dinner. Several days later he tried it agian, adding
other ingredients which he had purchased on his way to work: breast of chicken, chives, hard-boiled egg, watercress, and a wedge of
Roquefort cheese for the dressing. And that's how the Cobb Salad was born. Today, the Cobb Salad, though many restaurants serve
it under other names, is a national favorite."<br>

<a name="coleslaw">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Cole slaw</b></font><br>
We know from Apicius that Ancient Roman cooks prepared shredded cabbage dressed with
vinegar, eggs and spices. Food historians generally agree the term "cole slaw" is of Dutch origin,
implying perhaps that the true progenitor of modern coleslaw is most likely a Medieval creation
with Roman roots. Mayonnaise is an 18th century invention, meaning the recipe (as we know it
today) is only about 200 years old.
<p>
<b>The origin of the term "cole slaw' holds much interest for food historians. Notes here:</b>
<p>
"Coleslaw means literally  'cabbage salad'. English borrowed and adapted the word from Dutch
koolsla at the end of the eighteenth century, probably from Dutch settlers in the USA, and the first
printed example of it shows its outlandishness tamed to cold slaw--a folk-etymological
modification often repeated in later years. English does however have its own equivalent to Dutch
kool,  'cabbage', namely cole. Like kool, this comes ultimately from Latin caulis,  'cabbage', whose
underlying etymological meaning is  hollow stem'."<br>
---<i>An A to Z or Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p.
85)
<p>
<B>About cole slaw in America</b>
<p>
"Coleslaw. Also, "cabbage salad," Shredded cabbage, mayonnaise, and seasonings, usually served
cold as a side dish. The words are from Dutch koolsla, a combination of kool, "cabbage," and sla,
"salad" a dish that was known in America in print by 1785. Because it is usually served cold, some
call the dish "cold slaw" in contrast to "hot slaw," but there is no relation to the temperature in the
etymology."<br>
---<i>The Encyclopedia of American Food & Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New
York] 1999 (p. 92)
<p>
"The earliest European settlers on North America's eastern shores brought cabbage seeds with
them, and cabbage was a general favorite throughout the colonies. The Dutch who founded New
Netherland (New York State)...grew cabbage extensively along the Hudson River. They served it
in their old-country ways, often as koolsla (shredded cabbage salad). This dish became popular
throughout the colonies and survives as coleslaw...By the 1880s, cabbage and its cousins had
fallen from favor with the upper class because of the strong sulfurous odors these vegetables give
off when cooking...But this sturdy and versatile vegetable never disappeared from middle-class
kitchens."<br>
---<i>Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America</i>, Andrew F. Smith [Oxford
University Press:New York] 2004, Volume 1 (p. 147)
<p>
"Cool sla, cabbage salad, has, of course become cole slaw; in the nineteenth cnetury housewives
who had
forgotten, or never known, that cool is Dutch fo "cabbage," were already miscalling the dish "cold
slaw,"

modernized version of this 18th century salad (based on Mr. Kalm's description) here:
<blockquote>

2 cups red cabbage, cut into thin strips<br>
1/3 cup wine vinegar<br>
1/4 cup vegetable oil or 1/4 cup melted butter<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Crudites</b></font><br>
Raw vegetables in various forms appear in appetizer sections of American cookbooks of 
the 19th century. These were often stuffed (celery with cream cheese) or presented as garnish (radish 
florets). A survey of primary sources reveals raw vegetable platters with dip began showing 
up in the 1940s. At that time they were not called crudites. Our survey of cookbooks, magazines and newspapers articles confirms the use of the term "crudite" in 
American print at least to the 1960s. These vegetable platters were promoted by women's 
magazines (easy & portable), gourmet journals (creative and colorful), restaurants 
(inexpensive & easily assembled), and health professionals (raw vegetables are excellent for fighting 
cancer and other diseases). 
<p>
<b>What exactly are crudites (pronounced croo-dee-tay)?</b><br>
"Crudites. Raw vegetables or fruits served as an hors d'oeuvre, generally thinly sliced, 
grated or cut into little sticks and accompanied by cold sauces. Crudites include carrots, 
celeriac, cucumber, sweet peppers, red cabbage, celery, fennel, fresh broad (fava) beans, 
cauliflower (in very small florets), tomatoes, mushrooms, radishes, small artichokes, 
quarters of grapefruit, orange and apple, round slices of banana sprinkled with lemon, 
slices of avocado and, although it is cooked, beetroot (red beet). The various items are 
often presented as an assortment, with several sauces. A plate of crudites may also 
include a hard-boiled (hard-cooked) egg in mayonnaise." <br>

"Crudites is the kind of dish that's easy to take for granted. </b> There's nothing big deal about 
crisp and colorful vegetables arranged around a ramekin of tangy dip. Or is there? "It's 
been on our menu for 16 years," says David Evans, co-owner of The Great Lost Bear, a 
popular local eatery in Portland, Maine, where checks average about $15. "We could 
never take it off." That menu at The Bear is certainly big--about 120 items--and written 
with an eye for humor. The crudites with curry dip--which fetches $3.95 and accounts for 
more than 1% of the meal mix--is labeled "Some Like it Raw," followed by a brief 
description. The Bear's version of crudites is simple. The featured vegetables include 
celery, carrots, zucchini, mushrooms, bell peppers, cauliflower and broccoli, chosen 
because they are all readily available, consistently priced and don't need any cooking. If 
par-cooking is not an issue, then potatoes and string beans can be added to the list of 
vegetable choices. Of course, any of the raw vegetables could be blanched or steamed 
slightly, Just be sure not to overcook, and to shock them immediately in ice water. Some 
more unusual or seasonal vegetables also make excellent crudites: snap peas, fennel, 
assorted radishes, jicama, cherry tomatoes, olives, asparagus, watercress sprigs, cooked 
artichokes or even boiled broad beans. And don't stop with vegetables. Fruit crudites--with a sweetened yogurt, creme fraiche or sour cream dip--makes a festive breakfast or 
brunch item. How you cut, hold and present these products will determine how appealing 
the dish is to customers. Because the vegetables for "Some Like It Raw" at The Great 
Lost Bear are all used in other menu items, no special prep is involved and there is 
virtually no waste. According to Evans, everything is cut into convenient large slices 
except for the mushrooms, which are halved, and the trimmed broccoli and cauliflower 
florets. Evans' cooks do all the prep This crudites presentation with piquant bagna cauda 
dip features both raw and par-boiled vegetables ahead of time, and store the vegetables in 
water in the refrigerator. For service, chosen pieces are blotted and strewn on a big plate. 
The curry dipping sauce that accompanies The Bear's crudites has not changed in the last 
16 years. It's a simple blend based on a combination of mayonnaise and sour cream. The 
dip has become their signature. Vinaigrettes also make sprightly dips, especially if 
flavored vinegars or oils are used--although one that is completely emulsified and will not 
separate is both better tasting and better looking. Bean, legume, or vegetable purees 
provide reduced-fat alternatives with flavor and body. Consider offering customers a 
choice of different dips. There's also a resurging popularity in the close cousin of 
crudites--fondue--where a warm cheese sauce provides the centerpiece for a presentation 
that can include raw and/or par-cooked vegetables and bread cubes. Another hot dip for 
cool crudites is bagna cauda, a rustic, anchovy-and-garlic-flavored dipping sauce whose 
name translates as "warm bath" in Italian." <br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Fruit salad</b></font><br>
When did fruit salad originate? The answer depends upon how define the dish. Fruit salads  (ie combinations of various fresh, dried, candied [with sugar], stewed and/or
fruits with vegetables) since ancient times. The ingredients and recipes depended upon what was
available (country, seasons) and socio-cultural attitudes toward the ingredients (was raw fruit
considered healthy or not?). 
<p>
Fruit salad, as we know it today [a variety of fresh, often tropical, fruits], surfaces in the
mid-19th century. <a href="foodfaq.html#ambrosia">Ambrosia</a> is popular variation featuring coconut. Culinary evidence confirms sometimes fruit salad was mixed with sugar and
alcohol, thus the term "<a href="foodsalads.html#fruitcocktail">fruit cocktail</a>."  Non-alcoholic versions of
this
recipe were concocted during Prohibition. Also popular in the 1920s were jellied fruit salads. Think:
Jell-O molds. During World War II fruit salads were promoted to ensure proper amount of
vitamin C were included in the American diet. Both canned and fresh fruits were recommended.

Fruit salads in northern Europe (Germany, for example) evolved differently. These recipes used
mayonnaise. 
<p>
"Fruit salad, an item which has adorned millions of menus in the western world, was first
recognized as a dish in the mid-19th century....It is of course possible to have a  'salad' of dried
fruits and nuts, as in the Middle Eastern khoshab; and, further east, Indonesia offers the spicy fruit
salad rujak, which is patently different from anything in the western world." <br>

<p>
<b>[1926]</b><br>
"Salads in which fruits form a prominent part are becoming very popular. They are often served as a first course at
lunchoens or in place of a course of fruit at dessert. For a first course they should be rather acid or made with fruit
acid in nature, while later during a meal they are more enjoyed if sweetened and more highly flavored. As a rulee they are most 
attractive looking compounds often highly fragrant and appeal to all of our senses. Almost any kind of acid fruit is nice to serve
in this way. For eating with meats of birds the ordinary French dressing, omitting the onion, is good. For dessert, or at one of our 
American 'Teas,' cold sweet fruit mixtures are preferred. Neufchatel cheese is enjoyed with them at a late breakfast or 
luncheon. The fruit salads may be put into an ice cream freezer and cooled with the usual mixture of salt and ice. When
handsome glass or porcelain dishes, with silver ones to place them in, are not available a pretty way to serve fruit salads is in 
dainty glasses. Peaches, fresh figs and the many varieties of berries have always been popular with sugar and cream but, for
variety, try one of the following methods which may be considerably varied by changing the fruits and proportions as the 
supplies change or the taste varies.
<p>
<b>"Mixed Fruit Salad.</b> Fill delixated cuos or glasses with fresh pine-apple, bananas and white grapes, cut, halved and

four tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, one gill of sherry, one tablespoonful maraschino and two of champagne. Stir until the sugar
is dissolved and then pour over the fruit and let the classes stand in a cold refrigerator an hour before serving. Another dressing 
is made with four tablespoonfuls of sugar and half a teaspoonful of cinnamon mixed with two tablespoonfuls of sherry and the
same of Maderia [sic]. Some people delight in a mixture of acid fruit, currants, raspberries, morello cherries, strawberries etc.,

<a name="fruitcocktail">
<b>What is fruit cocktail?</b><br>
Fruit cocktail, a sweetened mix of assorted diced fruits served in a decorative stemmed glass, is generally presented in 
the appetizer course. 
Unlike its culinary cousins <a href="foodfaq.html#ambrosia">Ambrosia</a> (dessert) and 
<a href="foodsalads.html#fruitsalad">Fruit Salad</a> (salad), it was also commercialized. Early recipes are variously
monikered "fruit cup" or "fruit cocktail." The crossover was sorely noted by domestic scientists. Coincidentally? This period marked
the crossover between several late 19th health foods (most notably breakfast cereal & peanut butter)and sweet commercial profits.
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>[1901]</b></br>
"We have fallen so much into the fashion of practicing a 'course luncheon with what are sometimes called 'fruit cocktails' that
we have almost lost sight of the value of the fruit cup as a final course of sweets at dinner or luncheon. Our English cousins apply
the name 'dessert' to fruits alone. We give it, indiscriminently, to puddings, pies, ices, jellies, custards and fruits whatver may be
the name or nature of the dishes following the main business of the dinner. In bringing our present subject to the front, we harmonize
wth the nomenclature of both nations. Our fruit cup is especially convenient to the sagacious housemother, now that the changing
seasons invite latitude and indifference to foods that have been partaken of freely all winter. The full maturity of the berry is not
yet here..."<br>
---"School for Housewives," Marion Harland, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, May 15, 1910 (p. VIII6)
<p>
"In these latter days many American cooks make a mixture of fruit, sugar and alcohol, and serve
them as "salad." These are not salads; are heavy, rather unwholesome, and will never take the
place of a salad. I much prefer to call them fruit cocktails, and serve them as first course at at
luncheon or a twelve o'clock breakfast; or a dessert, and serve them with the ices at the close of
the meal. Fruits mixed with mayonnaise dressing, and served as a salad are unsightly, unpalatable
and little nauseating. One cannot think of anything more out of keeping than white grapes in a
thick mayonnaise. The simple so called French dressing is delicate and most worthy of
recommendation. Over lettuce, cress or celery it certainly makes a palatable and wholesome
dinner salad, and one in which children can be freely indulged. Such fruits as apples, pears,
cherries, and pineapples, mixed with celery or lettuce, with French dressing, make an agreeable
dinner salad."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Iceberg wedge (aka Heart of Lettuce)</b></font><br>

Period cookbooks, old newspapers, and culinary reference books confirm the
popularity of iceberg (also known as crisphead) lettuce in the 1920s. They do not, however, reveal claimants
(hotels, chefs, restaurants) to the invention of the classic American wedge-type salad served with creamy
dressing. The general concensus of current sources squarely places this salad as a ubiquitous menu entry
of the 1950s and 1960s. The lettuce wedge lost its place in the 1970s when consumers were intrigued by
more interesting salads. Recently, the iceberg wedge salad has resurfaced as a "reinvented" item on trendy
menus. The new accompaniments are blue cheese (Maytag, esp.) and nuts. What was <a href="foodsalads.html#iceberglettuce">Iceberg lettuce</a>?
<p>
<b>About Iceberg wedge salad</b><br>
"There once was a time--before the arrival of <a nref="#mesclun">mesclun</a>, frisee, endive, spring mix, packaged salads, radicchio and arugula--when iceberg lettuce dominated the produce aisle. Quartered, shredded, its leaves pulled off and transformed into cups
for canned pears, it knew no rival until the 1970s when Caesar Chavez called for a boycott to protest the working
conditions of California lettuce pickers. Tastes changed, too. The wedge of iceberg drowning in a thick dressing was
replaced with vinaigrette-tossed leaf lettuces (especially romaine) and smaller, more exotic "designer" greens, all more
nutritional and more flavorful than the "neutral" iceberg. Iceberg--a head lettuce, as opposed to a leaf lettuce--is also
known as "crisphead" lettuce since one of its chief virtues (some say its only virtue) is that it stays fresher longer than
leaf lettuces."<br>

<p>
"Short of heating up a TV dinner, there are few more blatantly retro gestures than ordering a wedge of iceberg lettuce
covered in a thick, creamy salad dressing. The lettuce itself remains popular in the United States. It still accounts for 70
percent of the lettuce raised in California, but that share is declining (in the mid-1970's it was as high as 80 percent), and
anyone dining at fancier restaurants around the United States might wonder if it hadn't disappeared entirely, displaced
by frisee, dandelion greens, oak leaf, lollo rosso, exotic cresses, microgreens, sprouts -- anything, in short, that's green,
has a leaf, and is not iceberg. But iceberg somehow manages to hang on. Steakhouses refuse to give it up. And in some
very unlikely places, it has earned a strange kind of cachet..."It's one of those things that's synonymous with growing up
in America," Mr. Otsuka said. "Everybody has a comfort level with it. Served cold, it's very nice on the palate, with a
good crunch." Marc Meyer, at Five Points, anoints a wedge of the stuff with a modernized, Europeanized blue cheese
dressing made with picon cheese from Spain, toasted almond slices and radishes...Despite its shortcomings, iceberg has
always had its fans. James Beard was one. "Many people damn it," he once wrote, "but when broken up, not cut, it adds
good flavor and a wonderfully crisp texture to a salad with other greens." It also keeps longer than other lettuces, he
pointed out. Flavor? Surely the iceberg stands supreme as the blandest of all greens. Little pieces? Most Americans side
with the prim instructions given in the first "<i>Joy of Cooking</i>." "Heads of iceberg lettuce are not separated," the directions
read. "They are cut into wedge-shaped pieces, or into crosswise slices." The lettuce is a relative newcomer, and
confusingly named. A lettuce that went by the name of iceberg was developed in the 1890's, and somehow the name
resurfaced when new varieties of durable, easily shippable crisphead lettuce began emerging in California in the mid-1920's. In 1948, the iceberg we know today was born. Why iceberg? No one seems to know, although one popular theory
holds that the name refers to the tons of ice that chilled it in the days before refrigerated rail cars. The big, cold wedge
is a cornerstone of American cuisine. It survives, and so do the sludgelike dressings that drape it like heavy velvet
curtains -- the great, goopy family that includes blue cheese, green goddess, ranch and Thousand Island. I went for the
wedge the other day at Del Frisco Double Eagle Steak House. It arrived under a lavalike green ooze, a creamily high-caloric green goddess dressing lumpy with tender bits of avocado....Michael Jordan's The Steak House...the wedge wore
a blue cheese dressing...John Schenk, the chef at Clementine, tuned in to this particular frequency years before tony
restaurants began playing with iceberg..."<br>

<b>About Iceberg Lettuce</b><p>
<b>"Ethnic/Cultural Info:</b>
This type of lettuce is an excellent choice for making a classic Greek salad with tomatoes, radishes and cucumbers. In
1894, a Burpee & Co. seed catalog stated this about iceberg lettuce: "There is no handsomer or more solid Cabbage
Lettuce in cultivation." Unfortunately, this lettuce variety has been the bane of true gourmet cooks and the butt of many
culinary jokes. It has been claimed that a "cold pack" made from chilled iceberg lettuce leaves aids in the relief of bumps
and bruises. Chill whole leaves in freezer for at least one hour; crumple and secure with tape on the injury. Works every
time. 
<p>
<b>Geography/History: </b>
They say this lettuce came to be when a different looking and sweeter tasting head of lettuce somehow appeared in a
grower's field over one hundred years ago. Noticing it was quite different from the lettuces surrounding it and liking its
flavor and superior crispness, the growers teamed with other lettuce producers to make it even better. This variety became
a top seller and remains very popular still today. More accurately called crisphead, there are actually many varieties of
this type of lettuce. Some varieties produce reddish leaves tinged with green and some have plain and scalloped edges.
Iceberg lettuce was called "crisphead", its true name, until the 1920s. It acquired the name iceberg because of its ability
to be an excellent long distance traveler when packed on ice. Depending on the time of year, crisphead lettuce develops
a firm head in 60 to 120 days and is harvested by hand. It has been claimed that a "cold pack" made from chilled iceberg
lettuce leaves aids in the relief of bumps and bruises. Chill whole leaves in freezer for at least one hour; crumple and
secure with tape on the injury. Works every time."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Macaroni (pasta) salad</b></font><br>
Pasta salad, as we Americans know it today, descends from a long line of dressed
macaroni dishes, both hot and cold. Dressings (oil/vinegar, mayonnaise, cream sauces) and
additions (vegetables, herbs, spices) varied according to culture and cuisine. In early 20th century
we begin to find recipes for macaroni salad in American cookbooks. These were typically
dressed with mayonnaise and served in cold molded presentations. Think: perfect domes of chilled macaroni salad served as "sides" in diners & delis. Alternatives? A side of
cottage cheese or coleslaw. In the USA, "Macaroni salad" generally denotes a mayonnaise dressed side dish, popular
for picnics. "Pasta salad" is generally dressed with <a href="foodsalads.html#frenchdressing">vinaigrette</a>. Both are served chilled,
can welcome chopped vegetables (celery, onion, olives)and are popular sides in hot weather. Which macaroni shape to use? 
<a href="foodfaq2.html#elbow">Elbow macaroni</a> is traditional in the USA. 
<p>
According to a survey of articles published in the <i>New York Times</i>, recipes titled "pasta salad"
were published in the early 1960s. They proliferated in the 1980s, when Nouvelle Cuisine
delighted in creating dishes with gourmet pastas of various shapes, sizes, and colors. Pasta salad
was a trendy way to carbo-load back in the Yuppie era. This simple, economical dish was
promoted on two fronts: upscale, affordable cuisine and practical way to use leftovers. Before
long?  Mainstream American food companies began promoting  "pasta salad" box kits.  These
can still be found in our grocery stores today.

"THE pasta salad,</b> that darling of the carry-out shop, is here to stay. Especially in warm weather,
the idea of tossing vegetables or seafood or poultry or meat or just herbs with a dressing,
anchoring the mixture with cooked and cooled macaroni, tortellini or spaghetti to make it filling
enough to be dinner is especially appealing.
Pasta salads can be strictly improvisational, relying more on a pass through the leftover
department of the refrigerator than on a planned shopping list. The inspiration can be Italian,
French, Asian or a combination of these influences assembled with a kind of artful freedom that
only a contemporary American kitchen can provide. Thus, Asian sesame oil and wine vinegar
imported from France that coexist on the pantry shelves can be called upon to dress the salad.
When preparing a pasta salad, it is important to bear in mind that pasta is high in starch. The
salad should be well-lubricated to prevent the mixture from becoming sticky and gummy, which
it often does as it waits to be served, especially if it has been refrigerated. The one problem with
a great many of the pasta salads prepared by catering shops is that they are too stiff. There are
two ways of alleviating this problem.
First, when preparing pasta, especially for a salad - and even when using leftover pasta that has
been in the refrigerator - the pasta should be well-rinsed in cold water. Don't worry if some of the
water still clings to the pasta after it has been drained, because the little that does will dilute the
sauce and may actually enhance the texture of the salad, keeping the dressing smooth and satiny.
Second, the dressing should be thick enough to cling to the pasta and the other ingredients but
should not be so stiff that it will not drop from a spoon. A heavy mayonnaise should be diluted
with some lemon juice, milk, vinegar and oil, well-stirred yogurt or other liquid. And after a
pasta salad has been refrigerated, it should be mixed to make sure that the dressing still coats the
ingredients and has not been absorbed by the pasta.
Adding cucumbers or tomatoes with their high moisture content to pasta salads helps maintain
the pleasing, smooth balance of pasta and dressing. If a salad has been refrigerated, always check
the seasonings before serving, because cold temperatures tend to diminish flavors.
The following salads can be served as appetizers, main dishes or side dishes for lunches, suppers
or picnics. Chicken and Ziti Salad 1 pound ziti Salt 1/2 cup chicken consomme 1 1/2 cups fresh
green beans, in
1/2-inch length (about 1/2 pound) 2 small zucchinis, quartered lengthwise and cut into 1/2-inch
thick slices 1 cup peeled, diced cucumber 4 cups diced cooked chicken 1/2 cup minced red onion
freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 cups mayonnaise, preferably home-made 3 tablespoons minced
fresh dill 1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts.<br>
1. Drop ziti into boiling, salted water and cook until tender, about eight minutes. Drain, rinse in
cold water and drain again thoroughly. Mix with consomme and set aside.<br>
2. Drop beans into boiling salted water and cook for one minute. Add the zucchini and cook two
minutes longer, until the vegetables are cooked but still crunchy. Drain, allow to cool and mix
with ziti. <br>
3. Add cucumber, chicken and onion. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper. Fold in the
mayonnaise and two tablespoons of the dill.<br>
4. Salad should be refrigerated if not used immediately. If the dressing has become too stiff, mix
in a little more consomme. Check salad for seasoning and garnish the top with remaining
tablespoon of dill and the walnuts before serving.
Yield: 8 servings. 
<p>
<b>Chinese Shrimp And Pasta Salad</b> 1 cup mung bean sprouts 3/4 pound raw
medium shrimp 1 cup peeled, seeded, sliced cucumber 1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger 2
scallions, minced 2 teaspoons minced fresh coriander leaves 1 tablespoon dry sherry 2
tablespoons rice vinegar 1/3 cup sesame oil, Asian style 1 teaspoon soy sauce 1/4 teaspoon hot
chili oil 1/2 pound Asian buckwheat noodles (soba), cooked, drained and rinsed in cold water.<br>
1. Bring a quart of water to a boil. Drop in the bean sprouts. When the water returns to the boil,
remove the sprouts with a slotted spoon and drain.<br>
2. Add the shrimp to the boiling water. When the water returns to a full boil the shrimp will have
turned pink. Remove shrimp and drain. As soon as the shrimp are cool enough to handle, shell,
de-vein and slice them in half lengthwise. Combine shrimp, bean sprouts and cucumbers and mix
with ginger, scallions, coriander, sherry, vinegar, sesame oil, soy sauce and hot chili oil.<br>
3. Place cooled, drained noodles in a bowl, toss with the shrimp mixture and serve. Yield: 2 to 4
servings. 
<p>
<b>Cold Pasta, With Fresh Tomatoes</b> 3 cups peeled, seeded, chopped ripe tomatoes 1
teaspoon finely minced garlic 2 tablespoons lemon juice 3 tablespoons white wine vinegar 1/3
cup olive oil 2 tablespoons minced fresh basil 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley 2 tablespoons
drained capers 2 tablespoons chopped pitted Greek olives 1 pound thin spaghetti or linguine salt
and freshly ground black pepper.<br>
1. Combine tomatoes, garlic, lemon juice, wine vinegar, olive oil, one tablespoon each of basil
and parsley, the capers and olives in a bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside.
You should need very little salt.<br>
2. Bring at least four quarts of salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti or linguine and cook until al
dente, six to eight minutes. Drain well and rinse thoroughly under cold running water. The
rinsing will cool the pasta and also remove enough starch so it is less likely to become sticky.<br>
3. Toss the pasta with the sauce. Taste and season with salt and pepper if desired. Sprinkle with
remaining basil and parsley and serve. Yield: 4 to 6 servings."<br>

<a name="mesclun">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Mesclun salad</b></font><br>
Mesclun, a salad composed of leafy greens of various colors and textures, originated in the Provence.
It could be argued that mesclun descends from the Ancient Roman tradition of serving mixed
greens with dressing. Some say this simple salad originated as peasant food. That would explain
its ommission from French culinary texts. Curiously (or not) J.B. Reboul's <i>La Cuisiniere Provencale</i> 
(1897) does not include mesclun. Escoffier, Elizabeth David, Julia Child are silent.
<p>
<b>When did Americans "discover" mesclun?</b><br>
Mesclun entered the American culinary lexicon in the late 1970s. Presumably, travelers returning from
 Provence clamored for the trendy "new" salad. California chefs in trendy restaurants recognized potential. Today, we find
pre-packaged mesclun mixes (aka spring mix) in mainstream supermarkets. And yes! They command higher prices than standard
salad greens. 
<p>
<b>Is it mesclun or mesclum?</b><br>
In the USA this leafy mix is called mesclun. Provencal purists prefer mesclum. There is <b>NO</b> connection between 
mescal (potent taquila ingredient) and mesclun.
<p>
<b>[1967]</b><br>
"The Provence regions along the Mediterranean coast are still the keenest herb-consuming areas of France, wehre the current 
'in' salad is called 'mesclun'--a medieval mixture of cost lettuces [red and white], chicories [both bitter and curly], chervil
and winter cress. Peasant food that has become the Rolls-Royce of salads, it commands high prices in Saint Tropez restaurants and
sells at the exclusive Fauchon store on the Place de la Madeleine in Paris at around $2 a pound."<br>
---"Latest from Paris," Monique, <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, August 3, 1967 (p. C8)
<p>
<b>[1979]</b><br>
"The lightest and most refreshing first course is the mesclun, a Provencale salad of lacy mixed
greens with a sharp vinaigrette dressing made with strong, fruity olive oil and served with garlic
and oil-flavored croutons."<br>
---"Great French Country Restaurants," Mimi Sheraton, <i>New York Times</i>, June 27, 1979 (p. C1)<br>
[review of Restaurant de Bacon]
<p>
<b>[1986]</b><br>
"Some say mesclun. Others say mesclum. Some insist that this fashionable Provencal salad is a
blend of a dozen different greens, all sown, grown and picked together. Jean and Yvonne Tabo,
maraichers, or market gardeners, who were among the first to grow it commercially in France,
are categorical: it's called mesclum. According to them, it's nine or 10 different greens, each
grown in separate rows, then tossed together in approximately equal proportions when picked.
And if you want each of the greens to have the right texture and flavor, you pick them when
they're very small and very young. 
<p>
"The Tabos, who live in Carros, the herb and vegetable growing region just north of Nice,
switched from selling vegetables to growing them about 10 years ago. They settled on mesclum
because, at the time, no one was growing this traditionally Nicoise salad mixture commercially.
Today, they are one of a handful of maraichers - and possibly the only ones - who specialize in
mesclum. Their lettuce is savored not just in France, but also in Copenhagen, London, Berlin and
Toronto, where it is flown three times each week, year round, from the Nice airport. (They do not
yet fly their mesclum to the United States, but are now discussing the possibilities with a
California supplier.) The Tabo mesclum, grown in impeccably neat rows in a series of low, open-sided greenhouses, includes red and green-tipped oak-leaf lettuce, rocket, romaine, chervil -both
a slightly curly white endive and a firmer, very curly green variety - escarole and a very bitter
variety of dandelion. In the wintertime, the Tabos add a few rows of colorful red trevise, the firm
and bitter lettuce that takes its name from the Italian town of Trevise.
<p>
"'For some reason, when we grow trevise here in the summertime, the leaves won't turn red, and it
doesn't taste the same,'' explains Madame Tabo. The greens are picked early in the morning, and
only the youngest, tenderest shoots are selected. Then, they are plunged together directly into a
water bath, drained and packed loosely in sturdy wooden crates for the market.
Like the history of many regional foods, the mesclum story is hazy. Some historians suggest that
both the word mesclum (Latin for mixture) and the idea for the salad blend, were brought into
Nice from the Ligurian region of Italy before Nice was reunited with France in 1860. In Nice, the
salad became known as mesclun in standard French and mesclum in the Nicois dialect known as
nissarde. The Tabos and others in the region remember that their parents and grandparents always
grew a blend of greens in the family potager, or vegetable garden, then mixed them with all the
wild and domestic herbs that grew so naturally and profusely in the area.
<p>
"During the late 1940's, as restaurants proliferated along the Cote d'Azur, mesclum grew in
popularity and also became better known outside of Provence. Today, maraichers like the Tabos
have plenty of company north of Nice, where the terraced hillsides are covered with row upon
row of serres or greenhouses, shelters for the tons of herbs, lettuce, tomatoes and zucchini
blossoms that are grown in the hot, humid climate year-round. The greens are usually sold in
loose bunches in outdoor fruit and vegetable markets throughout the region, and sometimes they
are simply called salade melange. The best place to find mesclum today is in Nice's Cours Salyea
open air market, held each morning but Monday. There are also large commercial operations that
grow the mixture, package it in plastic and sell it in supermarkets or sometimes open air markets.
<p>
No matter how mesclun is grown or what kinds of greens are contained in the mixture,, the
challenge for the chef is to present a multicolored, multitextured salad with a subtle contrast of
flavors, ranging from feathery and delicate to pungent and assertive. A home-composed mesclum
salad might include peppery nasturtium blossoms, firm-leafed pourpier (purslane), mache (lamb's
lettuce), senneson (chickweed) and parsley, as well as a few leaves of basil, summer savory and
lavender-tipped hyssop. Purists, such as the Tabos, insist that neither vegeta bles, croutons nor
cheese should be added to this already complex mixture, and that the salad should be tossed by
hand, after sprinkling it with a simple vinaigrette, consisting of nothing but extra-virgin olive oil,
homemade red wine vinegar, salt, pepper and perhaps a touch of Dijon mustard."<br>
---"Fare of the Country; Melange of Greens Grown in France," Patricia Wells, <i>New York Times</i>, 
November 9, 1986 (sect. 10, p. 12)
<p>
<b>[1991]</b><br>
"Throughout the  country, energetic and experimental gardeners and farmers are
creating scrumptious salads using eclectic blends of seasonal greens. Often referred to as
mesclun, such concoctions have their origins in the markets of southern France and northern
Italy and are the staples of everyday shoppers in Nice, Provence, Rome, and Athens. Mesclun
was introduced to our shores in part through the creativity of experimental and high-priced
restaurants. What the laborer eats in Europe is often remarkably similar to what's served to the
gastronomes of New York City. 
<p>
"After nearly a decade, mesclun has begun to enter America's backyard gardens. One example of
this trend is the popularity of 'Marvel of Four Seasons', a colorful red-leafed butterhead lettuce.
This gorgeous and tasty lettuce--which also stands up to the heat of early summer--was relatively
unknown four or five years ago. At that time it was sold only in a few specialty seed catalogs
such as the Cook's Garden, Le Marche Seeds International, and Shepherd's Garden Seeds, usually
under the French name 'Merveille des Quatre Saisons'. Now this lettuce is available from larger
seed companies as well. 
<p>
"Mesclun is a French dialect word from the region around Nice and translates roughly as
"mixture." The definition of the "proper" mixture of greens, however, is as varied as the number
of growers. Two of the most common ingredients are rocket, or arugula (Eruca vesicaria
subspecies sativa), and chervil (Anthriscus cerefolium). Some people attribute mesclun's
beginnings to thrifty market gardeners who harvested and sold the seedlings thinned from their
plots of salad greens. American gardeners and small-market growers have greatly expanded the
European concept to include edible wild greens, an amazing range of herbs, and colorful edible
flowers. Indeed, almost any edible plant can be used, and discovering new ingredients adds to the
fun of growing and serving mesclun. 
<p>
"One of the people who introduced and expanded the definition of mesclun is Doug Gosling, for
eight years the head gardener of the Farallones Institute, in Occidental, California (recently
renamed the Center for Seven Generations Gardens). An astute gardener, Doug is known for the
superb quality of his organically grown and meticulously gathered mesclun. One produce broker
in New York City rates the Farallones mix as "the best from the West Coast. It is the wonderful
blend of all the oddball and seasonal wild edibles that sets the Farallones mix apart from others."
Gosling says growing mesclun ingredients "brings a renewed sense of discovery and joy to the
garden. We look at the entirety of a plant's life to see what it has to offer. This approach to
growing a salad is really more about a shift in attitudes than a change in gardening skills." 
Sometimes new salad ingredients turn out to be plants thought of as weeds. "We used to overlook
plants like salad burnet [Sanguisorba officinalis], plantain [Plantago major], purslane [Portulaca
oleracea], and wild mustard [Brassica juncea]," says Gosling. "Now we gather different parts of
each and even move the plants around in the garden like any cultivated plant." Farallones
gardeners harvest the most succulent, tender, and tasty portion of each wild edible, and only
during its prime season. Tiny portions of young salad burnet leaves are gathered in spring.
Tender leaves of lemony dock (Rumex acetosa) are snipped from the heart of the rosette. Only
the first small leaves of the slightly bitter dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) are harvested. Tender
tips of lamb-squarters (Chenopodium album) are collected only until the plant begins to bloom.
The young, juicy foliage of purslane, however, can be used throughout the summer. And the best
time to use wild mustard is when the young flower buds have formed. At that stage, according to
Gosling, "they taste like a spicy form of sprouting broccoli." 
<p>
"Culinary herbs can also be included in mesclun. When an herbal garnish is mixed into the salad,
it's like incorporating some of the salad dressing--all that's needed is a splash of oil. The list of
herbs suitable for mesclun is long and includes plants such as chives (Allium schoenoprasum),
summer savory (Satureja hortensis), fennel (Foeniculum vulgate), golden marjoram (Origanum
marjorana), variegated lemon thyme (Thymus x citriodorus), the young leaves of lovage
(Levisticum officinale), basil (Ocimum basilicum), lemon balm (Melissa officinalis), anise
hyssop (Agastache foeniculum), and sweet cicely (Myrrhis odorata). Tiny sprigs, tender young
shoots, or the freshest flowers of these herbs are blended into the mix to give exciting bursts of
flavor. Be careful using the mints, however, as they bruise easily and darken in storage; a
vinaigrette dressing will darken the foliage even further. 
<p>
"While working at the Farallones Institute, Gosling developed a number of techniques for growing
mesclun that have made it more efficient to cultivate, expanded its range of flavor, and extended
its growing season. As Gosling remarks, "We had the luxury of approaching salad gardening as
an art. I could focus on excellence without the economic constraints that most farmers face." 
What impresses me the most about Farallones mesclun is its vitality and extended shelf life. If
properly refrigerated, it stays almost perfectly fresh for 10 days or more. Gosling explains the
mix's longevity thus: "Much of the keeping qualities are probably due to the early-morning
harvest. We carefully hand pick only the best leaves. We field wash the mix only if there's a bit
of wilt. The greens are spun dry. And certainly a healthy soil makes for healthy plants." 
The gardeners at Farallones prefer organic methods, which depend on a healthy, fertile soil. The
Institute's gardens were begun in 1975; to date, 75 to 150 tons of compost have been applied to
the raised beds, which total less than four acres. For each 100 square feet of bed, the gardeners
apply two wheelbarrow loads of compost and one wheelbarrow load of aged dairy manure. Next
they single dig the beds, breaking up the surface clods as they shape the beds. Gosling says that
he and the other gardeners actually "massage the beds, crumbling all the small clods with our
hands." Finally, before each bed is planted, they sprinkle it lightly with quarry dust, which costs
$9.00 a ton and provides valuable trace minerals."<br>

"What's in a name? A lot of dining and gardening excitement when the name is "mesclum."
One definition calls mesclum "nothing more than a mixture of special green, some tangy and
some mild, that are usually harvested young and mixed in your favorite salad.?" So meteoric is
its rise that the National Garden Bureau, a nonprofit research organization funded by seed
companies, has made 1997 the year of Mesclum."<br>

and  smash it as fine as possible with a fork; then add two pinches of paprika and a pinch of salt, half a
teaspoonful of French mustard, a teaspoonful of hashed chives, a teaspoonful of hashed estragon, two
tablespoonfuls of oil, and three tablespoonfuls of vinegar. Add this to the salad, mix it well together and serve."<br>

Food historians tell us noodles aka (macaroni, pasta) quite likely developed independently in two centers of origin: Asia and 
Europe. Notes <a href="foodsalads.html#food2.html#pasta">here</a>.
Over time, noodle recipes developed according to culture and cuisine. Think cold macaroni salad with 
mayonnaise, onions & egg [Germany], oil/vinegar dressing & fresh veggies [Mediterranean 
cuisine], veggie-laden pasta salads. "Chilled noodles," [aka Oriental Noodle Salad, Chinese Noodle Salad] as we American know them today, appears to descend from the Asian tradition 
of serving noodles for fast meals. Think: <a href="foodasian.html#noodlebars">noodle bars</a>. Food of the people: 
delicious, versatile, filling. Hot or cold! American-style <a href="foodsalads.html#chinesechicken">Chinese Chicken Salad</a> dates to the
 1930s. The dressings (& vegetables, spices, flavors) enjoyed in popular chilled oriental noodle salads of the 1980s/1990s 
partied harmoniously along this successful culinary theme. WHO among us does not like cold leftover lo-mein (or pizza 
while we're talking about fridged leftovers?). USA Oriental noodle salad simply, elegantly, intelligently, moved the cold noodle
concept to the next level. Special <a href="foodsalads.html#orientaldressing">Asian dressings</a> were developed for these new salads.
 <p>
Our survey of historic USA newspapers suggests this cold noodle salad was introduced to American diners in the early 1980s. This coincided with a resurging interest in "new" asian 
cuisine [apart from standard Chinese-American fare] AND carbo-loading diets. Think: <a href="foodsalads.html#pasta">chilled Italian pasta salad</a>  featuring small bite colorfully presented veggies & 
dressing</a>.  Cold Far east-inspired followed suit. Both salad types were promoted to savvy
lunchers as a healthy, economical, delicious alternative to standard fast, American traditional, or continental fare. As true with many recipes of this type, there are many variations and 
names. In the case of Oriental noodle salad, recommended noodles range from traditional (soba) to fast food (<a href="foodasian.html#ramen">ramen</a>). In a pinch "Italian" pasta products work just fine. The underlying culinary elements are cold noodles 
dressed oriental-type sauce. Sesame oil and peanuts are common, but not required, elements.

"A revolution is under way in American cooking. It has become the primary focus for cooking schools and cookbooks, young chefs and new restaurants...Thousands of words have

"The noodle was born in China. The peanut in South America. Cooks united the two in spicy cool salads. And we can't seem to get enough.</b><br>
 During the past decade, variations on the theme have become standards on menus of catering businesses, restaurants, supermarket delis, takeout food shops and 
casual cafes. Countless cookbooks include recipes for this popular dish, equally welcome on winter buffet tables and summertime picnic tables. When they're out of 
Oriental Noodle Salad at The Wedge, employees might as well duck behind the counter to avoid the wrath of disappointed customers. Leah Sprinkle, head chef at 
this specialty food store in University Village, says their blend of noodles with an Indonesian-style peanut sauce is a bestseller. During a busy week, with caterings,
 they make more than 50 pounds of it. Jane Hummer of Mangetout Inc. says the pairing of cool noodles and peanuts in salads seems to transcend all boundaries: 
"Whether we're catering at a construction site or in the elegant boardroom of a major corporation, this salad is a favorite."The blended flavors do a slow dance on 
the tongue - the sweet and sour from sugar and rice wine, the saltiness of soy sauce, the spiciness of chili peppers. But it's also the textures - the smoothness of cool 
noodles, the creaminess of peanut butter, the crunch of whole or chopped peanuts. Thin Chinese noodles - either dry or fresh - are standard for this salad. But you can substitute thin spaghetti - vermicelli or angel hair pasta. The salads are good for entertaining because most can be made in advance and refrigerated. As today's five recipes illustrate, imaginative cooks drive several culinary detours on their way to the same destination: 
-- Chinese Noodle Salad with Citrus and Spicy Peanuts gets flavor accents from orange juice and peel, rice and sherry vinegars, grated fresh ginger and jalapeno 
pepper. Raw shelled peanuts are baked with a mixture of oil, paprika, cayenne pepper and salt. Snow peas, carrot, green onions, daikon radish and cilantro 
provide more flavor, texture and eye appeal. The recipe is from Greens, the acclaimed vegetarian restaurant in San Francisco. Chef Annie Somerville says Chinese 
noodle salad has been a favorite since opening day, and this is the newest version. <br>
-- The dressing for Asian Peanut Noodles includes crunchy peanut butter, brewed black tea, sesame oil and hot chili oil. <br>
-- Peanut Noodles with Shrimp can serve as a main course salad. A half- pound of small cooked shrimp are tossed with the other ingredients, including pineapple 
chunks. The salad can be made up to 24 hours in advance. Stir in the roasted peanuts and diced cucumber just before serving. <br>
-- Chunky peanut butter and coarsely chopped roasted peanuts both appear in Peanut-Yogurt Noodles with Slivered Vegetables. Matchstick slices of carrot and
 red bell pepper brighten the appearance. <brf>
-- Combine parsley, garlic, peanuts, soy sauce, salt, sesame oil, butter or margarine, lemon peel and juice and freshly ground pepper in a food processor, and you 
have Peanut Pesto, a quick and easy mixture to sauce noodles or pasta."<br>

"Remember when pasta salad meant elbow macaroni dressed with mayonnaise and not much else? Well, times have changed, and today the term pasta salad is just 
as apt to refer to Oriental noodles bathed in sesame oil or cheese tortellini tossed with sun-dried tomatoes. The options have swelled like noodles in water. 
Supermarkets offer a boatload of pastas, from tiny acine di pepe from Italy to soba noodles from Japan. Stir-ins, once limited to onions, celery and peppers, have 
expanded to exotic produce, imported cheeses and trendy seasonings. Even the dressings add variety, with flavored oils and infused vinegars pouring on new
 tastes. What all this means is that this summer's picnics and patio parties should not be boring. We offer a quartet of ideas, including a takeoff from the Middle
 Eastern tabbouleh, a sesame-flavored noodle salad from the Orient and a tortellini toss that's sunny with Mediterranean flavors. And for macaroni salad lovers, we 
present a version that is almost all-American. <p>

<a name="panzanella">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Panzanella</b></font><br>
The concept  is ancient, the practice is contemporary.  Food historians confirm salads and breads of all sorts
were enjoyed by Ancient mediterranean peoples. Bread dried quickly in the hot southern European climate.
Thrifty people were not inclined to discard old bread; they cooked with it. Both salads and breads were often
combined with tangy oil-based dressings. The marriage of all three was inevitable. Panzanella!
<p>
Modern recipes for panzanella  (there are dozens of variations) can't be older than the 16th century. Why?
Tomatoes are a new world food. The general concensus of the food experts is that panzanella, as we know
it today, originated in the middle regions of Italy. The recipe was promoted to mainstream America in the late 1970s.
The oldest reference to panzanella in the <i>New York Times</i>
is a restaurant review for Da Silvano, January 14, 1977 (p. 56). A survey of magazine and newspaper
articles reveals this salad became popular with gourmet diners in the United States sometime during the
1980s. Today? We find panzanella salad made with all sorts of interesting ingredients such as French bread,
commercially-made salad dressings, artichoke hearts, and seafood.

"Panzanella...Summer salad of central Italy consisting of tomatoes, cucumber, onion, basil, vinegar, and olive
oil. Also pan molle (soft bread) and panbagnato (soaked bread). From the Latin panis (bread)."<br>

"Waverly Root speaks none too fondly of panzanella: "A poor man's lunch," he calls it, "salad dressing on
bread, producing a sogginess which accounts for its name (litlle swamp)." Mr. Root and his palate
notwithstanding, panzanella is one terrific lunch. Basically a Tuscan bread salad with oil and vinegar, what else
it contains depends upon who is doing the cooking. Tuscans call panzanella a cold picnic dish, with the 
ingredients put together at the last minute, the bread soaked in water at home, the tomatoes and cucumbers
simply picked from the vines as needed. But one Roman source describes it as a first course served in large
families to fill everyone up before the more expensive second-course dishes are put on the table. Tony May,
the owner of Sandro's, Pailio and La Camelia, three Italian restaurants in Manhattan, says the dish is also
called pane molle, which means "soft bread."...Earthy and satisfying, panzanella is, at the same time, cool and
refreshing. In "The Food of the Western World," Theodora FitzGibbon talks about the anchovies, chilies, basil,
garlic and capers it contains by never mentions tomatoes, except as a garnish. Other recipes call for onion,
cucumber and celery. On calls for spring onions rather than yellow of red onions. Mr. Fiorti uses both green
and red peppers...The proportions vary from cook to cook. Some use vast quantities of olive oil--six ounces
to a half pound of bread--while others use only two ounces for a pound of bread. In fact, panzanella is a salad
designed to be made with leftover, stale bread and whatever of the other ingredients are available. Italia
bread--purists insist it must be Tuscan bread--is also indispensible, though there have been recipes
suggesting the substitution of whole-wheat bread or rye bread for those who are not fortunate enough to have
easy access to the comactly textured Italian, or even French, country loaves."<br>

"Q: I am trying to recreate a tomato and bread salad that I had when I was in Italy - and I never seem
to be able to get it just right. Something is missing. Hopefully you have some advice. Thanks. _ Jay
.J.
A: So you want to make a Panzanella Salad. Panzanella ... doesn't it sound like some sort of military
attack, using old-fashioned cannons? Actually it's what a tomato and bread salad is called....Tuscan
bread, some seasonal tomatoes, some fresh basil, a little bit of really good local olive oil, and some
balsamic vinegar. Toss it all in a bowl... Panzanella was probably invented for three reasons. One
of them was because Italy was a very poor country for many years and bread was inexpensive. Also,
nothing was wasted, and with this recipe, they could use stale bread. The last reason it probably came
about was in the warm, dry Italian summers it was useless trying to keep the bread fresh. When it
became dry they figured out a way to revive it with some simple ingredients. Today we think of
Panzanella as a bread and tomato salad, but it's interesting to note that the salad actually dates to
before the 1500s when tomatoes, a product from the New World, were unknown in Europe. So the
original Panzanella salad did not have tomatoes, but probably included whatever was on hand in the
garden _ like peppers, cucumbers, onions, and garlic, along with some capers, black olives, possibly
anchovies, olive oil and a little bit of vinegar or lemon juice. I'm going to assume that you had the
Panzanella in Tuscany, because it is considered a Tuscan dish (however, there are distinctive
Panzanella salads from other regions, such as Sicily.)"<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Perfection salad</b></font><br>

The term "Perfection Salad" has two meanings. In the broadest sense, it has come to stand for the
social impact of American Domestic Science/Home Economics of the late 19th/early 20th century.
Laura Shapiro's book <i>Perfection Salad: Women and Cooking at the Turn of the Century</i> explains the
movement in detail. "Perfection Salad" is also a real recipe. It belongs to a class of molded gelatine
salads made popular by food companies around the turn of the 20th century. The origin is generally
attributed to the Knox Gelatin Company (Johnstown NY).
<p>

"At the tail end of the 19th century (in the United States) the domestic science/home
economics movement took hold. Proponnents of this new science were obsessed with control.
They considered tossed plates of mixed greens "messy" and eschewed them in favor of
"orderly presentations." Salad items were painstakenly separated, organized, and presented.
Molded gelatin (Jell-O et al) salads proliferated because they offered maximum control. 
"Salad greens, which did have to be served raw and crisp, demanded more complicated
measures. The object of scientific salad making was to subdue the raw greens until they bore
as little resemblance as possible to their natural state. If a plain green salad was called for, the
experts tried to avoid simply letting a disorganized pile of leaves drop messily onto the
plate...This arduous approach to salad making became an identifying feature of cooking-school cookery and the signature of a refined household...American salads traditionally had
been a matter of fresh greens, chicken, or lobster, but during the decades at the turn of the
century, when urban and suburban middle class was beginning to define itself, salads
proliferated magnificently in number and variety until they incorporated nearly every kind of
food except bread and pastry...Salads that were nothing but a heap of raw ingredients in
disarray plainly lacked cultivation, and the cooking experts developed a number of ingenious
ways to wrap them up...The tidiest and most thorough way to package a salad was to mold it in
gelatin. American cooks were already accustomed to making fruit and wine jellies, or serving a
decorative main dish such as boned turkey in apsic, and for these preparations they used either
commercial gelatin or a homemade calf's foot jelly. The former, while more convenient, was available only
shredded or in sheets, and needed to soak half an hour or longer before it was ready to use. In 1893
Sarah Tyson Rorer wrote to the Knox company suggesting that they produce their gelatin in granulated
form, which would be easier to measure and would dissolved more quickly. A year later Knox began
advertising a "Sparkling Granulated Gelatin," and offering to send upon rquest a copy of the recipe
booklet "Dainty Desserts for Dainty People." Other manufacturers quickly imitated the innovation., and
within the decade flavored granulated gelatines had been introduced as well. At first the new product
was used much as the old shredded gealtins had been--to make puddings, mousses, charlotets, and
jellies, as well as the occasional main dish, or tomato aspic--but the possibiltiies for the salad making
soon became evident. "This is dainty for company," suggested a contributor to New England Kitchen
Magazine, and gave directions for a cheese salad that she made by adding graunalted gelatin to a
boiled dressing, then folding in whipped cream and grated cheese, and molding the mixture in egg
cups for individual services."<br>
---<i>Perfection Salad: Women and Cooking at the Turn of the Century</i>, Laura Shapiro [North
Point Press:New York] 1986 (p. 96-99)
<p>

"In 1905, Charles Knox ran a recipe contest that launched the Age of the Molded Salad. Mrs. John
Cooke of New Castle, Pennsylvania, submitted her recipe for Perfection Salad, a tart gelatin mold
strews with bits of cabbage, celery, and sweet red pepper, which the judges--Fannie Farmer among
them--awarded third prize...Knox printed the recipe in its next recipe booklet and continuted to offer it in
subsequesnt pamphlets printed throughout the twentieth century, updating it now and then to suit the
times. Perfection Salad inspired cooks as few recipes have. And the rise of Jell-O at approximately the
same time, the proliferation of its fruity flavors, and the industry of its advertising staff in "papering" the
country with Jell-O recipes fueled the molded-salad boom. Soon every woman had her particular
favorites...Only in the late  60s did molded salads fall from favor and then mostly in sophisticated
metropolitan areas where chefs were beginning to experiment with composed salads and an exotic
new palette of greens."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Potato salad</b></font><br>
<a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/books/kiple/potatoes.htm">Potatoes</a> (a new world food) were introduced to Europe by Spanish explorers in the 16th century.
By the end of the century many countries had adopted this new vegetable and integrated it into
their cuisines. Preparation methods and recipes were developed according to local culinary
traditions. 
<p>
Arnold Shircliffe, executive chef of Chicago's legendary Edgewater Beach Hotel, traced the origin
of the potato salad to the 16th century. These are his notes:<br>
"Early potato salad: John Gerrard in 1597 writes about potatoes and their virtues and said that
"they are sometimes boiled and sopped in wine, by others boiled with prunes, and likewise others
dress them (after roasting them in the ashes) in oil, vinegar and salt, every man according to his
own taste. However they be dressed, they comfort, nourish and strengthen the body." This is one
of the first potato salads mentioned in any book." <br>
---<i>Edgewater Beach Hotel Salad Book</i>, Arnold Shircliffe [Hotel Monthly Press:Evanston
IL] 1928 (p. 231)
<p>
Potato salad-type recipes were introduced to America by European settlers, who again adapted
traditional foods to local ingredients. This accounts for regional potato salad variations in the
United States. Potato salad, as we know it today, became popular in the second half of the 19th
century. Cold potato salads evolved from British and French recipes. Warm potato salads
followed the German preference for hot vinegar and bacon dressings served over vegetables.  
<p>
Print evidence confirms recipes for potato salads were often included in 19th century
American cooking texts. These recipes had many different names. <i>The Cassells Dictionary of
Cookery</i> [London:1875?] contains three recipes for potato salad, one without notes
[presumably British or American], a French recipe and a German recipe.The French recipe is very
similar to the first and is also served cold. The German recipe required bacon. Early cold potato
salad recipes often called for "French dressing"  (Our notes on French dressing <a
href="foodsalads.html#frenchdressing"> here</a> ). Some recipes specifically indicate this is an
economy dish, "a good way to dispose of leftover potatoes." During the
1940s mayonnaise began to supplant French dressing as the congealer of choice.  It is interesting
to
note that during both World Wars recipes for German-style potato salad did not bear that
country's moniker. They were simply listed as "hot potato salad." 
<p>
<b>This is what the food writers have to say:</b><br>
"Potato salad. A cold or hot side dish made with potatoes, mayonnaise, and seasonings. It became
very popular in the second half of the nineteenth century and is a staple of both home and
food-store kitchens. Hot potato salad, usually made with bacon, onion, and vinegar dressing, was
associated with German immigrants and therefore often called "German potato salad."<br>

York] 1999 (p. 253)

"There seems to be no dogma concerning the origins of potato salad, but Germany is a good place
to

"Despite its popularity in this country, potato salad is not an all-American creation. Potato salad is
said to be
of Teutonic origin, prepared when boiled potatoes were tossed with oil, vinegar and seasonings, a
dish
known now as German potato salad. The French, Norwegians, Swedes, Russians and Italians all
have their
own versions. Germans make a marvelous warm potato salad to which they add tiny bits of fresh
tomato
and red and green bell peppers, then toss the whole concoction with a warm bacon and onion
dressing.
The Greeks also prefer warm potato salad, with garlic, olive oil and lemon. Italian potato salad is
apt to
have ample amounts of fresh parsley, often chunks of salami and is dressed with an olive oil and
vinegar
dressing. American potato salad is heavier and heartier than European versions. Some people like
lots of
additions such as onion, sweet pickles, celery, hard-cooked eggs, pimento, chives, olives and

"Potato Salad.</b><br>
When materials for a salad are scarce, this is a good way of disposing of cold potatoes. Slice
them, and dress them with oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper, precisely like any other salad; adding a
little chives, or an onion, and parsley chopped fine. If oil is not agreeable, use cream or a little
melted butter."<br>

<b>[1908] "Potato salad</b><br>
The best potato salad is made from waxy yellow potatoes, cooked with their jackets on, the
peeled, cut up while still warm and dressed before they become cold. Put the potatoes into a salad
bowl, then pour over them a little hot water, or, better still, a little hot broth from the soup
kettle. Season it at once with salt, pepper, and for every teaspoonful vinegar use four spoonfuls
olive oil. Add as you like chopped onion, parsley, chives or celery, toss without breaking the
potatoes, then set in the ice box to chill. When ready to serve put into individual lettuce leaves or
a salad bowl lined with lettuce, and on top put a spoonful of boiled dressing as a garnish."<br>

<b>New York style (aka deli style) potato salad</b><br>
The general concensus of <a href="http://www.bigspud.com/pnydeli.txt">online recipes</a> is
that New York Style potato salad is served cold and has a mayo/vinegar dressing. Culinary
evidence suggests this recipe has British or French roots. <i>The Brooklyn Cookbook</i>, Lyn

When and where did tossed or mixed salad begin?
Excellent question. The answer depends (in part) on how you define tossed greens/mixed salad. Food historians tell us 
rudimentary mixed (several types of greens) salads were known to neolithic peoples. 
Salads composed of fresh mixed greens dressed in vinegar and spices were enjoyed by Ancient Romans. 
This culinary tradition survived from European Medieval times to the very end of the 19th century. Some 
cuisines preferred warm salads, others, cold. In the late 19th century (USA) the domestic science/home economics movement 
took hold. They considered tossed plates of mixed greens "messy" and eschewed them in favor of "orderly presentations." Salad ingredients were painstakingly 
separated, organized, and "glued together" with mayonnaise or gelatin. <a href="foodsalads.html#perfectionsalad">Molded gelatin</a> salads proliferated because they offered 
maximum control. 
<p> 
<b>Enter: tossed salad</b><br> 
Our survey of American cookbooks and newspapers confirms mixed, tossed salads regained popularity in the 1930s. Home economists promoted 
fresh vegetables as important (inexpensive) dietary supplement during the Great Depression. Coincidentally? This is when atrfully crafted large 
<a href="foodsalads.html#woodensaladbowls">wooden salad bowls<a> were introduced. Overnight? Tossing salad in front of company became trendy. Wooden 
salad bowls remain popular today. 
<p> 
<br><blockquote>
<b>[1934]<br>
"A Salad Bowl Salad</b><br>
Don't always hide the secrets of your salad making within the four walls of your kitchen. Sometimes carry all the "fixins" right
to the table in a big roomy wooden or china bowl or even a gay kitchen mixing bowl and toss and serve there. To the greens in the
salad bowl--a mixture of them is always nice--you may add rosy red radishes, whole or in slices; crisp cucumber, thinly sliced;
tender young scallions; asparagus, cooked, chilled and cut in suitable pieces; thin green pepper rings; crisp celery; ripe, 
green or stuffed olives; or tomatoes, cubed or sliced. A lone strip of cold bacon may be cut in small pieces and added. And toss in 
that one cold potato, cut in cubes, or the spoonful of peas or string beans, or the one remaining stalk of asparagus. Slices of hard-cooked
egg or pieces of cold meat, chicken or fish, contribute to a hearty salad too. And cheese either cubed, sliced or broken in pieces
is always a welcome addition to the salad bowl. The mellow flavor of avocado adds much to the fruit salad look especially when
raw strawberries, halves of cooked prunes, sections of orange, pineapple or grapefruit, fresh or canned are combined with it! And don't
froget the grapes. Such combinations as the above tossed and turned in a well-seasoned French or Mayonnaise dressing make a salad fit for
the gods. And don't forget to cut a peeled bud of garlic rubbed on the inside of your salad bowl or dropped into your French
dressing for a short time is a favorite seasoning to many."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Tuna salad</b></font><br>
Culinary evidence (old cookbooks, menus etc.) confirms meat (ham) and mayonnaise-type salads were popular in America
from colonial times present. These were culinary traditions brought to our shores by European (esp. German)
settlers. Lobster and <a href="foodsalads.html#chickensalad">chicken salads</a> were most common and extremely popular in the mid-late 19th century. Tuna
salad is an early twentieth century recipe. Why? Because canned tuna was first introduced and mass marketed to the
American public in 1903. American cookbooks in the 1930s and 1940s offer tuna salad recipes as alternatives to
salads made from chicken and turkey. One might conclude this fishy substitution was not immediately embraced on
its own merits.
<p>
"Tuna Salad Popular. In California the tuna is beign introduced generallly in the best restaurants, not only because it is new, but
becuase people are beginning to value it for what it is. Tuna salads are getting to be popular. The housekeeper can prepare the fish
in a dozen different ways."<br>

1 tablespoonful vinegar<br>
2 tablespoonfuls lemon-juice<br>
Mayonnaise dressing<br>
1 tablespoonful capers<br>
1 hard-cooked egg<br>
2 or 3 stuffed olives.<br>
Line a salad dish with shredded lettuce. Break the fish into pieces and place it on top of the lettuce. Mix the salt, red
pepper, lemon-juice, and vinegar toghether and pour over the fish. Chill, and when ready to serve, decorate with the
capers, slices of hard-cooked egg, and the stuffed olives. Service with mayonnaise dressing.

href="foodsalads.html#watergatecake">cake</a></b></font><br>
Pistachios have been enjoyed since the beginning of time. They have generally considered luxury
items. In the 20th century, technological advances made them more accessible to home cooks.
Culinary evidence confirms these nuts were most often used to flavor ice
creams and parfaits. They were also sometimes used in pates, salads (toppings, molded in
combination with other ingredients gelatine), baked goods, and candy.  Notes on pistachios and
their use in cookery <a
href="foodsalads.html#pistachios">here</a>.
<p>
Although salads and cakes made flavored with pistachios date back to the early 20th century,
culinary
evidence connects the recipes we know today as Watergate Salad and Watergate Cake to the
Kraft Company, dating from the mid 1970s. Why the Kraft connection? Both recipes use pistachio
instant pudding mix, which was introduced by Kraft Foods in 1975. 
<p>
<b>Why Watergate?</b><br>
The answer seems obvious to everyone who knows a little about American political events during
that time period. Interestingly enough, it has yet to be confirmed. The Kraft does not take credit
for the name. In fact? No one does. 
<p>
We do know that in 1973 two tongue-in-cheek "Watergate" cookbooks were published: The
Watergate Cookbook, N.Y. Alplaus [Emporium Publications:Charlestown MA] and The
Watergate Cookbook (Or, Who's in the Soup?), The Commitee to Write the Cookbook [New
Lone Star Press:Cambridge MA]. These were apparently inpired by Tom Donnelly's article
"Serve Hot, The County the Silver," published earlier that year in the Washington Post. Neither of
these books, nor Donnelley's article, contain recipes for Watergate Salad or Watergate Cake.
<p>
"We developed the recipe for Pistachio Pineapple Delight," says Pat Risso of Kraft Corporate
Affairs. "It was in 1975, the same year that pistachio pudding mix came out."The company, however, didn't suggest serving the dessert as a salad or change the name. As a matter of fact, the
company didn't refer to it at all as Watergate Salad until consumers started requesting a recipe for
Watergate Salad. The answer from an e-mail query to http://www.kraftfoods.com got a little
warmer. "According to Kraft Kitchens, when the recipe for Pistachio Pineapple Delight was sent
out, a Chicago food editor renamed it Watergate Salad to promote interest in the
recipe when she printed it in her column," the response came back. A call to Carol Haddix, food
editor of the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, got a quick response. "Never heard of it," she said. 
A half dozen calls to former Chicago food editors, publicists and retired Kraft Kitchens personnel
also hit dead ends." <br>

Richmond Times Dispatch</i>, August 4, 1999 (p. F-1)

article, but neither the article nor editor has been tracked down. The

<b>WATERGATE CAKE</b>
<p>
"A new Watergate crisis is sweeping the Washington area, but this time only homemakers and a few business men seem to care...
The crisis stems from the growing popularity of a recipe for a concoction called "Watergate Cake," which demands large quantities
of powdered pistachio pudding mix, both in the layer cake and in its light green icing. Apparently, only one firm, Royal Pudding, a division
of Standard Brands, Inc., distributes pistachio pudding in the Washington area. Supermarkets haven't been able to get engouh to cope
with the demands, which began around Thanksgiving time and was very heavy at Christmas. Store shelves have been regularly stripped
of the mix the same day it is displayed...If the sales spurt is not directly attributable to the popularity of Watergate Cake...
"The we don't knoe why this product has suddenly taken off. It's been just phenomenal..." Barry Scher, a spokesman for Giant
Foods, placed the blame not only on the recipe, but also on a coincidental shortage of pistachio nuts. "That was about five months
abo, the spokesman said, "And as it ended, this recipe began circulating around. We were bombarded. We hate to admit it, but we 
just can't keep the mix on the shelf. The onset of Watergate cake mania--and the resulting effort to close the supply-demand gap
--has tested old friendships and challenged the ingenuity and competitive instincts of many a Washington-area homemaking...
No one, meanwhile, seems able to pinpoint the origin of this Watergate, the recipe for which has appeared in a number of
newspapers, including the <i>Washington Post</i>. Nor can anyone explain how the cake got its name or why pistachio is the main
flavoring. One current explanation leans on the presence of crushed walnuts in the cake--"bugs" in the parlance of kids. Like the 
Giant spokesman, Harold Giesinger, proprietor of the Watergate Pastry shop, had no thoughts on where the recipe originated--
except that it was not with his bakery. "We haven't invented anything to which we'd attach a name like that," he said. Nor, 
he added, does his shop rely on pistachio as a key ingredient in any of its products. "A private source may have put it together, "
he said of the recipe. 
Wherever Watergate Cake started, the pudding firm would like more more problems like it. Gagan suspects some people have been buying more
pistachio pudding mix than they'll ever use, simply becuase it's hard to get...Further relief is in sight. Another manufacturer, 
General Foods, scanning the Watergate-assisted pistachio market, has decided to jump in. Its version is expected to hit the
supermarket shelves in March..."<br>

<b>Pistachio cookery</b><br>
"This pistachio, with its unique color and mild but distinctive flavour, has always been a luxury,
costing three or four times as much as other nuts. It is generally eaten roasted and salted as a
dessert nut. In cooking it is often used as a garnish or decoration, both in sweet and savory
dishes. For example, it figures in in some of the finest pilaf dishes and in European pates and
brawns which are served in slices, so that the nuts appear as attractive green specs or
slivers."<br>

"In Mediterranean and Oriental cooking, pistachios are used in poultry sauces and stuffings and
also in hash. In classic cuisine they garnish galantines, brawn (head cheese) and mortadella. In
India pistachio puree is used to season rice and vegetables. Pistachios go best with veal, pork and
poultry. Their green color (often accentuated artificially) makes them popular for creams
(especially for filling cakes, such as the galacien) and for ice creams and ice-cream desserts. In
confectionery it is especially associated with nougat."<br>

The food historians and linguists tell us lettuce was [most likely] first cultivated by the ancient
Greeks, possibly as early as the 6th century BC. There is some controversy regarding the date
because there were several ancient plants fitting the description of lettuce at that time. 
<p>
"Wild lettuce was gathered for millennia by hunter-gatherers and was still being gathered by
humans at the time of the ancient Greeks. The latter probably began its cultivation, which was
continued by the Roman. The first cultivated letuuce was Lactuca serriola, which is native to the
Mediterranean region."<br>

"The ancient Greeks and Romans cultivated the lettuce, especially as a salad. In the East its
cultivation possible dates from an earlier epoch. Nevertheless it does not appear, from the
original common names both in Asia and Europe, that this plant was generally or very anciently
cultivated. There is no Sanskrit nor Hebrew name known, nor any in the reconstructed Aryan
tongue. A greek name exists, tridax; Latin, latuca; Persian and Hindu, kahn; and the analogous
Arabic form chuss or chass. The Latin form exists also, slightly modified, in the Slav and
Germanic languages, which may indicate either that the Western Aryans diffused the plant, or
that its cultivation spread with its name at a later date from the south to the north of Europe. Dr.
Bretscheider has confirmed by supposition that the lettus is not very ancient in China, and that it
was introduced there from the West. He says that the first work in which it is mentioned dates

Romaine was appreciated by the wealthy based on its appearance on a menu served at the Harvard Club's

<b>Arugula & Rocket</b><br>
Arugula (aka Rocket)  is an "Old World" cruciferous plant. The leaves have been used for
centuries in salads. They have a tangy, mustardy-flavor, which makes the salad interesting in flavor and texture.
<a href="foodsalads.html#americanarugula">Americans</a> "discovered" this tasty green in the 1990s.
<p>
"The rocket is a Eurasian plant with spicily hot-tasting dandelion-shaped leaves that are used in
salads. It has become much more widely known in Britain following the salad revolution of the
late twentieth century. The name rocket comes via French roquette from Italian ruchetta, a
diminutive form of ruca, which in turn comes from Latin eurca. This meant literally  caterpillar',
and was applied to the plant because of its hairy stems. It may have been derived from er, 
 hedgehog'."<br>

"Rocket, Eruca sativa, a plant which grows wild in Asia and the Mediterranean region, has been
introduced elsewhere, including N. America (where it is known by its Italian name, arugula), and
cultivated for use as a salad plant. Its flavour, akin to that of horseradish or some sorts of cress, is
strong in mature leaves, so these are added to salads with discretion. Young leaves may be used
freely. Their popularity as a smart ingredient in western restaurants may obscure then fact that
they are grown and liked in some places, e.g. the north of Sudan...In classical Rome the plant was
cultivated both for its leaves and for its seeds, used as a flavouring. The seeds can also be used to
produce and oil."<br>

widely available in the United States, where it has been naturalized. Its leaves resemble those of

"Chicory...decribes a group of perennial cultivated plants developed from wild chicory, a common
plant of Europe, W. Asia, and Africa...Chicory was used as a vegetable and for salad in classical
Greece and Rome, but was not apparently cultivated. The leaves of the wild plant are not too bitter if
gathered young. From the 16th century onwards modern cultivated forms, with larger and less bitter
leaves, were developed...The practice of taking up chicory plants in the autumn, cutting off their leaves,
and replanting the roots in a dark cellar so that they regrow small, white leaves originated in France.
The original French variety called, like the wild plant, Barbe de Capucin is unusual in that the roots are
replanted on their sides in angled banks and the shoots grow horizontally. Around 1850 a Belgian
grower, experimenting with uses for old musroom compost, discovered the superior cigar-shaped form
Witloof...The large-rooted variety of chicory which is used as a coffee substitute was developed in
Holland during the second half of the 18th century, when coffee was newly fashionable and very
expensive. All over Europe people experimented with substitutes: grains, figs, acorns, and all kinds of
root, especially dandelion and chicory. Chicory was judged the most acceptable."<br>

they can then be coated with bechamel sauce, sprinkled with noisette butter, served with gravy or with
plain butter and herbs topped with grated cheesse and browned, or made into a puree. They can be
served as an accompaniement to roasts and poultry. They can also be braised, made into a chiffanade or

hand in promoting it, though not necessarily as a Caesar. As for its origin, the best guess seems to be that the whole 
thing started in Tia Juana, during prohibition, but whether it was actually created by one named 'Caesar,' or just named 
for him, is a matter of considerable discussion. The salad is at its best when kept simple, but as it is invariably made

"Caesar salad. A salad of romaine lettuce, garlic, olive oil, croutons, Parmesan cheese, Worcestershire sauce, and, often, anchovies. It was created by Caesar Cardini, an Italian immigrant who opened a series of restaurants in Tijuana, Mexico...On Fourth of July weekend in 1924 at Caesar's Palace, Cardini concocted the salad as a main course, arranging the lettuce leaves on a plate with the intention that they would be eaten with their fingers. Later Cardini shredded the leaves into bite-sized pieces. The salad became particularly popular with Hollywood movie people who visited Tijuana, and it became a featured dish at Chasen's and Romanoff's in Los Angeles."<br>--- <i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F.

<p> 
"It was an accident! But now Caesar Salad is tossed in handsome salad bowls, coast to coast-and on purpose! A well-known restaurateur, Caesar Cardini, concocted this zesty salad some 35 years ago at Tijuana, Mexico. Here is the true story, told to us by his daughter Rosa. One holiday weekend a throng of tourists descended on Caesar's Place. A few crates of romaine, half a case of eggs, a wheel of Italian cheese, some lemons, and dry bread-that was all the food left by Sunday morning. What to do for the hungry crowd at dinner? Caesar thought he'd have to close shop for the remainder of the holiday. Instead he decided to invent a new salad form the ingredients he had on hand. He got out the eggs, the lemons, the Parmesan cheese, the bread, and the big bottle of olive oil to which he previously had added garlic. With the romaine lettuce as the only greens, he experimented with a little of this and that in the dressing. Finally, to bind the dressing ingredients together, he came up with the idea of coddling the eggs for a minute, then tossing them with the salad. (Yes, that's right the original Caesar Salad was not made with completely raw eggs.) The loaves of bread he cut in tiny cubes and slowly oven-toasted them to add to his salad at the very end. (The anchovies, now a familiar ingredient in Caesar Salad, didn't become part of the recipe until some 10 years later.) While the waiters kibitzed, Caesar demonstrated his creation. 'Take everything to each table,' he instructed, 'and make a ceremony of fixing the salad. Plenty of fanfare. Let guests think they're having the specialty of the house.' And the guests did! So rapidly did the news of this remarkable salad spread, that diners flocked to Caesar's Place just to learn the recipe. Soon West Coast restaurants adopted it; then it appeared on the finest menus in every state. Caesar Cardini's reward? In Paris at the 1951 meeting of the International Society of Epicures, his salad was acclaimed the greatest recipe contribution of the United States in 50 years. But it was really at Tijuana, Mexico that the now world-famous Caesar Salad was born. You'll find many variations of Caesar Salad, but here Rosa Cardini, who operates the food specialty shop her father started in Los Angeles and who bottles the original Caesar salad dressing, share his authentic recipe and salad know-how."<br>

<b>Story 2: </b><br> 
"It has been fairly well established that the late Caesar Cardini created the Caesar salad at hist restaurant in Tijuana, Mexico. Or did he? The
 latest word is that an Italian woman named Beatriz Santini composed the salad in Austria in 1918. Hard put for food in a country impovershed by 
war, she soft-boiled eggs, which were plentiful, and added them to a bowl of romaine lettuce. A little Parmesan cheese, a dressing of wine vinegar 
and olive oil, and the creation was complete. Cardini never met Santini. So how did he come up with the same idea? He didn't, we are told. The 
link was Santini's son, Livio, who emigrated to Tijuana. Livio Santini got a job with Cardini, who had opened a bar and restaurant on Second Street
 about 1924. One day, a hungry Santini mixed up a bit of his mother's salad. A wealthy customer from La Jolla invaded the kitchen as Santini was
 crunching romaine, and she asked for a taste. It pleased her so that she ordered a serving from Cardini, who came out to find what Santini was 
eating. One week later, the salad was on the menu, ceremoniously mixed at table side by a captain and busboy. Thus, the start of the Cardini
 legend. The teller of this tale was no tale-spinner. It was Livio Santini himself. Now 78, Santini was a guest of honor at Tijuana's recent first 
Caesar salad celebration."<br>---"Hail, Caesar! Doubts raised Over Origin of Famous Salad," Barbara Hansen, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, September 13, 1984 (p. J1)

<b>The anchovy debate: </b><br> 
Food historians agree anchovies were not part of the original recipe. These salty fillets infiltrate in the 1930s. 
<p> 
"Cardini was adamant in insisting that the salad be subtly flavored and argued against the inclusion of anchovies, whose faint flavor in his creation he believed may have come from the Worcestershire sauce. He also decreed that only Italian olive oil and imported Parmesan cheese be used."<br>--- <i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i> (p. 51) 
<p> 
"According to Santini...his mother used no anchovies, no lime or lemon juice and no croutons in her salad...The controversial anchovy, acknowledged by either Beatriz Santini nor Caesar Cardini, wound up on several salads.".<br>---"Hail, Caesar! Doubts raised Over Origin of Famous Salad," Barbara Hansen, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, September 13, 1984 (p. J1) 
<p> 
"The shocking truth is that while a proper Caesar always has anchovy, an authentic one never does. In its original form, Caesar salad was more a culinary tourist trap than a great American food standard, famous for the tableside show that came with the salad, not the anchovy. Yet it is the anchovy that most Caesar aficionados consider vital; only Caesar wimps ask for their salad sans the small fry. So where did the anchovy come from?...The most common theory involves Worcestershire sauce. The thinking is that Someone, Somewhere Along the Way...ran out of Worcestershire sauce...saw anchovy on the list of ingredients and made the brilliant substitution. 'We can't figure it out,' said Rosa Cardini, daughter of the salad's inventor...Cardini envisioned his a subtle salad, but as Rosa pointed out, subtle is exactly what anchovies aren't."<br>---"Caesar!

<b>When did Ceasar Salad become popular in the USA? </b><br>

"Jean Harlow, Mable Hormand and all the stars would come to Tijuana and ask for a Cesar's salad, [Cesar Cardini] recalled...But it didn't become 
famous until 1937 when a screenwriter, Manny Wolfe, one of my regular customers, went to the house of Murphy restaurant here, called for the
 ingredients and made the salad. The manager, Di Ciro, called it his salad,. But Wolf took the recipe to the Brown Derby and Chasen's and they

garlic. It's garlic with glamorhe first time I heard of a 2-buck salad, I wanted to render unto Caesar what was Caesar's--a big loud razberry. They 
my beautiful wife...pointed out that it was an aristocrat of foods. Like stone crabs in Miami, oysters Rockefeller in New Orleans, lobsters in Boston,
 cream cheese and bagels in New York. 'Why do they call it Caesar salad?' I kept asking. And finally I found it was invented by an Italian named
 Caesar Cardini in his Tijuana restaurant, called Caesar's. Edmund Lowe tasted it there and brought it to Hollywood. Caeser's ex partner, Peter
 Friggerio, formerly at the Colony and Marguery in New York, is now the captain at Henri's here where, of course, you can get a wonderful Caesar 
Salad. But confidently, the French-born Henri De Charpentier, who's chef there and used to be at Lynbrook, L. I. thinks it's a big mistake to have 
such a huge glamorous salad before the main course."<br>

"Los Angeles revisited a few weeks ago, for the first time in two years, revealed more conclusively than almost anything else that the gastronomic
 highlight of the current moment is an arrangement called Caesar's Salad and that its consumption is constant, universal, and something to make 
the public prints in any fountainhead of good living like GOURMET, as it has. Caesar's Salad, which is only infrequently encountered in restaurants
 in the East, but which will inevitably arrive in New York one of these fine days, is based on romaine instead of lettuce, chopped-up anchovies, a 
liberal inclusion of heavily garlic-flavored croutons, French dressing made slick by the inclusion of a couple of whole raw eggs, and the whole thing
 liberally showered with grated Parmesan. At Romanoff's, where we were taken to luncheon by GOURMET's own Stephen Longstreet, with an 
assortment of local characters which included Bob Hope, Gregory La Cava, Barbara Stanwyck, and Hedda Hopper at adjacent tables, we were 
introduced to Caesar's Salad. At Dave Chasen's, where we dined that evening with Robert Hanley, the newly discovered and flourishing decorator
 of the County Strip, we were immediately advised that Caesar's Salad was the thing to have. The next evening at Hansen's Scandia Restaurant in
 Sunset Boulevard, the assembled chivalry to a man commanded Caesar's Salad, and subsequent skirmishes with the menus at Perino's, the Vine
 Street Brown Derby, the garden restaurant of the Town House, and other ranking restaurants of the City of Angeles evolved the conviction that 
Caesar's Salad is as much of a part of the Hollywood pattern as swimming pools or the new look."<br>

<b>Who was Cesar Cardini? </b><br> 
An Italian immigrant who wound up in Tijuana. Obviously savvy, Mr. Cardini operated a successful restaurant offering trendy cuisine to America's
glamoros Hollywood stars. He left Tijuana in 1935 because Mexican regulations against gambling were crushing his business. Mr. Cardini eventually
settled in Los Angles, running an imported foods store. He cashed in on his claim to fame by selling his dressing. He passed away at the age of 60 in 1956.
<p>
"Mr. Cardini devised the salad while operating the restaurant and hotel which still bears his name in Tijuana. Since 1935 he has lived in Los Angeles 
and was active in the marketing of the salad dressing he concocted. He was born in Lago Maggiore, Italy, worked many European hotels and came
 to the United States when he was 20. For a time, before going to Tijuana, he owned a restaurant in Sacramento...He leaves his widow Camille, a 
daughter Rosa...two sisters [living in Italy] and two brothers, Alex and Caudencio, who are in the restaurant business in Mexico City."<br>

<b>Vintage recipes</b><br> 
Several publications claim they have "the original" recipe. All of them are slightly different. Our gastronomic guess says the simpler the recipe, the 
closer to the original. And? Most definatley NO ANCHOVIES! Most probably Worcestershire.  There are no Caesar Salad (or approximations) 
recipes in these trendy Southern California publications: <i>Corona Club Cook Book</i> [1925], Ebell Society <i>Cook Book</i> [1926] or 
<i>Fashions of Foods in Beverly Hills</i> [1931].
The oldest print recipe
food historians have identified (based on ingredients & method) was published in <i>Sunset</i> (magazine) <a href="foodsalads.html#sunset1945">
March, 1945</a>. Curiously? It's called "Romaine Salad." No reference to
Caesar. The casual reader could easily miss the connection. The <a href="foodsalads.html#caesardressing">Caesar dressing</a> appears in
 the <i>The Brown Derby Cookbook</i>/Cobb [1949] but not the salad.  We hypothosize this omission may be at testament to the salad's "star 
power." Enjoying a Caesar Salad was a glamorous public event, complete with live tableside show. 
<i>Sunset Cook Book</i>/Annabel Post [1960] mentions
the March 1945 recipe but prints the <a href="http://foodtimeline.org/sunset1957">1957 version</a> (with anchovies, p. 19).

"Down in Coronado. California, there's a restaurant called La Avenida Cafe which is known as the 'Home of the Romaine Salad.'
Small wonder, for the salad which is their specialite de la maison is a dish to tempt the epicure. Here's the recipe as given us
by S. Jack Clapp, who is La Avenida's authority on such matters.<br>
<b>Romaine Salad</b><br>
3 or 4 heads chilled, crisp Romaine<br>
2 handfuls crisp croutons (little cubes of fried bread)<br>
6 tablespoons garlic oil<br>
4 tablespoons olive oil<br>
Salt and black pepper to taste<br>
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce<br>
6 heaping tablespoons greated Parmesan-type cheese<br>
1 egg<br>
Juice of 3 lemons<br>
Break the Romaine in to a salad bowl; add croutons, oil, seasonings, and cheese. Break the raw egg over the salad, ten pour the 
lemon juice over the egg. Toss all together lightly from the bottom, and serve. Serves 6. Regarding the ingredients, Mr. Clapp
has this to say: <i>Romaine:</i> Purchase pale green heads. Remove outer leaves, wash thoroughly, shake dry, and chill in 
refrigerator. <i>Garlic Oil</i>: Chop or mash a clove of garlic and place in bottom of a pint jar. Fill jar with any salad oil
keep at kitchen temperature, and use as needed. Use the oil only; don't add the garlic to the salad. <i>Olive Oil</i>: In the case of this
particular salad, best results are obtained if only a part (4 tablespoons) of the oil used is olive oil. <i>Black Pepper</i>:
If possible, grind it yourself with a pepper mill. Use plenty. <i>Parmesan-type Cheese</i>: Ideally, this should be freshly
grated. <i>Egg</i>: The raw egg acts as a binder and causes the dressing to be evenly distributed through the salad. The
flavor of the egg is not detectable in the finished salad. With the salad, Mr. Clapp suggests serving Garlic Toast. To make it, 
split French rolls, brush the cut surface with garlic oil, sprinkle with Parmesan-type cheese and paprika, and heat in the oven."<br>

Crush a clove of garlic and add it to  of a cup of olive oil. Let stand overnight. Brown 2 cups of croutons, made from stale sourdough French bread, in  cup of this garlic oil, stirring
 them carefully so that they will color on all sides. Drain on paper toweling. (Or, if you prefer, merely toast the bread cubes brown in a slow oven.) Now break 2 large or 3 small heads 
of romaine into a large bowl, grind on a good generous amount of fresh black pepper and add  teaspoon of salt, then dress with  cup of the garlic oil. Turn the salad until every leaf is 
glossy with oil, then break 2 eggs, cooked one minute, plunk into the middle of the salad. Now, before the mixing is resumed, squeeze the guide of a big fat lemon directly over the egg
 (if the lemon is small, use 1  or even 2 of them!), and mix so that there is a thick creamy look to the lettuce. If you wish to include fillets of anchovies, and many say you must, here is 
where they are added-6 to 8, snipped into bits. Now taste it, and don't hesitate to use your fingers. More salt? More lemon? Add them, or vinegar if you wish, plenty of experts do so.
 (And others insist on a slug of Worcestershire!) The seasoning is now as you want it, so a good  cup (at least) of grated Parmesan is tossed in, the salad mixed some more, and finally 
the croutons are added, and the salad served at once so they won't become limp and soggy. Like any salad of this kind, the artists adds (or subtracts) as he goes along, so Caesar salad,
 as you make it, is all your own! Serves a dozen, more or less.<br>

<b>Commercial production notes</b>
When the legendary Caesar Salad was *invented* by Mr. Cardini in his Tijuana eatery in the 1920s, he made the dressing 
from scratch. According to his obituary, Mr. Cardini actively promoted commercial manufacture of his famous salad dressing:

Food historians generally credit Philip Roemer, chef of the Palace Hotel in San Francisco, for the
creation of Green Goddess Salad dressing. It was allegedly made in honor of George Arliss, an
actor starring in a play by that same name. The year is fuzzy because the play ran in the 1920s
followed by a popular film version in the 1930s. 
Our survey of historic American cookbooks confirms mayonnaise-based salad dressing recipes
proliferated during the early decades of the 20th century. In fact? Entire books were devoted to
salads at that time. We examined several books and found several recipes for mayonnaise-tarragon-anchovy dressings-onion dressings. Given the noteriety of Green Goddess, it seems
surprising to find recipes named such first surfacing in the late 1930s-early 1940s. Sometimes
they are called "Green dressing." 
<p>
"In the mid-1920s, actor George Arliss starred in a William Archer play called The Green
Goddess. During the San Francisco run, he stayed at the Palace Hotel and dined often at its Palm
Court Restaurant. To honor Arliss, chef Philip Roemer created a new mixed green salad with a
creamy herb dressing. "Green Goddess," he called it."<br>

Roquefort cheese is ancient; roquefort salad dressing is 20th century.
<p>
<b>About Roquefort cheese</b><br.
"Roquefort, one of the three most famous blue cheese of the world, had a longer recorded history
than either of the others (Stilton and gorgonzola). It is porbably the cheese which Pliny, writing in
the 2nd century AD, described as  bearing off the prize at Rome'. It is certainly the cheese which the
monks of St. Gall offered to the Emperor Charlemagne in the 9th century...Until fairly recent times
the sheep's milk which was used came from sheep grazing in the vicinity [of Le Combalou in
France]. However, when production of Roquefort was stepped up in the 10th century the supply
became inadequate. The rules were therefore adjusted to permit the use of sheep's milk from certain
selected places such as Corsica and Pays Basque...The Societie Anonyme des Caves et des
Producteurs Reunis de Roquefort, founded in 1842 and known to all simply as La Societe, is
responsible for 80% of the production."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 670
<p>
Roquefort...has been made for thousands of years...but the earliest known record of it in English is
not before 1726."<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 286)
<p>
"According to legend, Roquefort was discovered centuries ago-possibly before the Christian
era...The legend has it that a shepherd boy in the rocky country of the Causses left his lunch of bread
and ordinary curd cheese in one of the cool caves of the district, thinking to come back for it later
in the day. But it was weeks before he returned to find his abandoned lunch. Then, with the morbid
curiousity of those who cannot throw anything away without peeking first, he looked, he smelled,
and then he tasted. At which there may well have followed on of the greatest Aha's in gastronomic
history...And since 1411 when Charles VI issued a decree restricting the name Roquefort fo the
cheese made int he Roquefort district of the Causses, no other...could be called Roquefort."<br>

<b>Roquefort salad dressing: </b>
Our food history sources indicate Roquefort dressing, as we know it today, may be a relatively new
item. None of the sources we checked credit a particular person/place with the invention. We do
know that creamy cheese dressings were not part of early modern French cuisine. Roquefort
dressing/sauce is not included in Escoffier's <i>Guide Culinaire</i> [1907]. It is the "dressing of choice"
for classic <a href="foodsalads.html#iceberg">American Iceberg Wedge salad</a>, circa 1950s-1960s.
<br>
<blockquote>

<b>[1911]<br>
Roquefort</b>...is generally eaten in small quantities at the end of a dinner. It is especially delightful if
rolled with half its bulk of butter, sprinkled liberally with cayenne pepper and spread on toasted
biscuits. It is also used to fill the hollow parts of stalks of celery, etc."<br>

it is thin enough to serve. This dressing is suitable for lettuce, tomatoes and other green vegetable

There is some controversy regarding the origin of <a href="foodsalads.html#russiansalad">Russian Salad</a> and Russian Salad Dressing.
Primary evidence confirms these recipes were known in Russia in the 19th century. They were
introduced by the French and known as "Vinaigrette" or "Salad Olivier." American food historians
generally believe that Russian Salad/Dressing are American inventions based on selected ingredients
associated with Russian cuisine. 

Russian dressing, as we know it today, it is a creamy vinaigrette concoction. These dressing were popular in the 19th century.
This is also the base for <a href="foodsalads.html#frenchdressing">French Dressing</a>.
<p>
"Russian dressing. A salad dressing made form mayonnaise, pimiento, chile sauce, green pepper, and
chives. It is so called possible because the mixture was thought to resemble those found in Russian
salads, but it is American in origin, first found in print in 1922."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999
(p. 278)
<p>
"I rather doubt that you will find a recipe for Russian dressing in any Russian cookbook, and it seems
quite definately of American origin. To the best of my knowledge you won't find it in the French
repertory of cooking under sauce Russe or otherwise. It is my belief that the original recipe for the
dressing contained caviar, in addition to mayonnaise, chili sauce, horeseradish, and grated onion, and
that this is the source of the name."<br>

<p>
"Like strawberries Romanoff, other dishes that Americans associate with Russia carry Russian names
but are not part of the traditional cusine. These include russian dressing, a mixture of mayonnaise and

caviar, but that is unlikely. The name probably refers to the Russian love of pickles, as pickles or
relish are often added to the dressing."<br>

<b>Russian salad?</b><br>
What we Americans know as Russian Salad originated in the that country in the 19th century. It was
created by a French chef and composed (partly) of native ingredients. Most notably, beets and pickles.
In Russia it was called "Salad Olivier," after the chef who concocted it:
<p>
"Salad Olivier. This salad is a creation of a French chef, M. Olivier, who in the 1860s opened a
fashionable Moscow restaurant, The Ermitage, where the salad became so popualr that ever dinner in
the restaurant included it. The original recipe involved grouse meat, crayfish tails, and truffles. The
most respected chefs in town tried to re-create the dish, but it never came out as well as at The
Ermitage, possible because of the unique compound flavoring of the mayonnaise, whose secret M.
Olivier never divulged."<br>
---<i>The Art of Russian Cuisine</i>, Anne Volokh [MacMillan:New York] 1983 (p. 60)
<p>
"As for 'Russian salad', as interpereted in western countries (i.e. diced cooked vegetables in or with
mayonnaise), it was essentiallly a French-Russian creation called Vinegrety which had a dressing of
oil and vinegar."<br>

<p> "A request for "Russian Salad Dressing" arouses my curiousity as to what some cook has, quite independent of tradition, given that
name. As far as my experience in a number of countries goes, the salad dressing served with Russian salad is the mayonnaise alone, or for
more exquisite salads a mayonnaise mixed with a bit of gelatin or highly seasoned meat jelly (aspic) melted. In some cases if a fine
salad is wanted each of the ingredients is mixed with a French dressing (marinated), and allowed to stand for an hour or more before
they are put together, and served with a mayonnaise...As to how a Russian salad is different from a French macedoine or jardiniere...
it might be hard to decide, in some countries, but there is probably no doubt but that in Russia smoked salmon and other rfish are used in it.
As it became popular in other countries only the mixture of cooked vegetables has been used, peas and carrots being essential.
Russian sald in Italy is defined as "all kinds of cooked vegetables cut up together and served with mayonnaise."...Artusi says that the
thing called Russian salad (Insalata Russa), "now the mode for dinners," has the fundamental characteristic that cooks slop
together what they please. He states that he makes it simply of lettuce, beet root, green beans, potatoes, carrots, capers,
little cucumber pickles, salt anchovies, and a hard boiled egg. He cuts up and arranges these, according to his own fancy, then 
makes a mayonnaise. He prepares a gelatin, puts a layer of it into a mold, and arranges on a layer of it different colored vegetables
et cetera...The following recipe is a famous Belgian cook's recipe: Salad Russe...Add at the moment of serving three or
four tablespoons of 'mayonnaise a la gelee,' (with gelatin) well seasoned which you have beat to a cream on ice. Press in a dom 
form and cover with mayonniase. Decorate with details of pickles, of beet root cut in rounds and crescents, with capers and filets of 
anchovy."<br>

Many food historians credit <a href="http://www.1000-islands.com/inn/dressing.htm">Sophia LaLonde</a>, of Clayton NY, with the invention of Thousand Island dressing. Her
recipe, as legend has it, was popular with vacationers summering in the Thousand Island region between New York and
Canada. LaLonde's hotel, now renamed the Thousand Island Inn, stills serves the "original product." We've been there and it is
delicious! Historians also credit two other originators for this dressing: Oscar Tschirky, of the Waldorf Astoria [NYC] and Chef Theo 
Rooms [Chicago]
<p>
"National Culinary Progress, official organ of Progressive Culinary Association, published at Chicago, give the origin of Thousand Island Dressing. Chef
Theo Rooms of the Drake Hotel, Chicago, is credited as being the originator of this famous dressing. It was first produced in 
The Blackstone of Chicago, when this hotel was first opened, and Mr. Rooms was the chef de garde manger. The magazine quotes 
Mr. Rooms to the effect that it was first called Blackstone Dressing. Later, Mr. Rooms, in collaboration with Albert Awater, 
maitre d'hotel of the Blackstone, gave to it the name Thousand Island Dressing. Another story of its creation is that it origainted 
in the home of George C. Boldt, in the Thousand Islands of the St. Lawrence River, and that it was served under the name of
Thousand Island Dressing in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, New York, before served in The Blackstone."

September 19, 1915, 6 to 8PM. "Head lettuce and Orange Salad, Blackstone Dressing," Duluth-News Tribune (MN), September
19, 1915 (p. 11). The earliest recipe we found was this:<blockquote>

catsup with two of vinegar. Roquefort cheese may be added if desired."<br>

<p>
What were the original Thousand Island dressing ingredients? If the owners of the hotel (now holders of the trademark) won't divulge, it is
unlikely we will ever know. There is no recipe for Thousand Island Dressing in Oscar Tschirky's famous <i>Cookbook</i> by
"Oscar" of the Waldorf, circa 1908. Our survey of historic American newspapers offers the earliest references to Thousand
Island dressing in 1912. Recipes begin to show up in American cookbooks about as 1916. As one might expect, there were several variations!
<p>
Surprisingly? The oldest print reference we found to Thousand Island Dressing came from a Texas newspaper:<br>
"At University of Texas tent at the State Fair yesterday, Miss Rich gave a lecture on "Salds and Salad Dressing,"...Demonstration 
is given. Tomato and green pepper salad, vegetable salad with thousand island dressing and stuffed cherry salad were prepared. The

Why do we use wooden salad bowls & when did they become popular in the USA? On first pass, we assumed wooden salad bowls

<b>Are they French?</b><br>
The French connection is tenuous. Escoffier (1907), Madam E. Saint-Ange (1927), Louis Diat (1941,1946) offer copious notes 
& several salad recipes. The French advocated rubbing garlic on the side of the salad bowl before adding greens 
(presumably to enhance flavor) but none comment on the physical properties of the salad bowl.
<p>
<b>Great Depression connection?</b></br>
Historic USA primary sources place wooden salad bowls in the middle of
the Great Depression. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was a fan but she does not say why. Possibly? Her endorsement 
inspired national embracement. Print evidence confirms 1930s USA promtion for making <a href="foodsalads.html#tossedsalad">tossed salads</a>

"Three grand prizes have been selected for their attractiveness as well as their practicability. The first prize is a 
handsomely carved and brilliantly decorated wooden salad bowl, with matching wooden serving spoon and for. The colors are 
resistant in vinegar and other salad ingredients and will remain intact through constant use. The bowl can be used for
 salads served at the table or as an effective background or fruit or vegetable centerpiece for the dining-room table."<br>

"Although a comparative newcomer to the household, the salad bowl already is an emblem of American hospitality. Generous 
of size as a rule, and filled with attractively arranged and appetizing combinations of fruits or vegetables, it bids 
fair to make a place for itself in the American tradition of hospitality similar to that achieved by the samovar in 
Russia. Wooden salad bowls are the most popular here and whether yours is made of fine, matched woods or roughly hewn or
 cheaper material, it must be treated according to the traditions established for it. First, rub a tiny piece of garlic 
around its inner surface. The bowl must never be washed. Instead, wipe it thoroughly with a dry towel." <br>

"Crisp, crinkly and delectably cool--they're something about a salad prepared at the table or carried in from the kitchen that wins a vote for green toss-ups. As an
 inspiration to salad-tossers, the shops show a tempting line-up of bowls in wood, glass, pottery and china with wooden spoons and fork accompaniments. Experts
 insist that the wood bowl is the thing, as it is less likely to bruise the tender greens. According to an old tradition, the wooden salad bowl should never be washed. If 
this is against your idea lf cleanliness, compromise by washing with warm water, but never with soap-suds. Mixed greens top the list for summer piquancy. Fresh 
young leafy greens, besides leaf and head lettuce, such as chicory, endive, kale, escarole, water cress, romaine, dandelion greens, beet tops, parsley, spinach, 
Swiss chard and green and red cabbage are all naturals for the salad bowl. Carrots, white turnips and parsnips are also vegetables to give tang and color to the 
salad and also a crunch quality. For garnish, or even as a part of the salad proper, red radishes, tomatoes, chives, cucumbers and onions are all vegetables that like 
each other's company. For the extras which may be added to the dressing, or as a garnish, there is parsley , green pepper, ripe or green olives, pickles, anchovies, 
hard cooked eggs, and even pomegranate seeds. Salad epicures agree that the best dressing for the salad bowl is French, and that it should be mixed through the
 ingredients and not drizzled over the top. Don't miss the fun of mixing your own dressing some time, although there are excellent dressings on the market. A chief 
'must' in the green salad is a faint trace of garlic. Rub a clove of it around the bowl before dripping in the greens, or it may be shaken in the bottle with the dressing.
 The French custom is to rub a crust of dry bread with the sliced clove leaving the bread in the bowl until the tossing is finished. Don't ever chop garlic and add it as
 another ingredient. The key to salad success is to have everything crisp and cold. Prepare things at least an hour in advance and chill in the refrigerator until ready 
to serve. Tear of break the ingredients into bits, but not so fine as to give a chopped-up look. Hash is a grand dish, but not in the salad bowl."<br>
