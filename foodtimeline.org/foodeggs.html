<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>When and why did humans begin consuming eggs?</b></font><br>
Humans have been consuming eggs since the dawn of human time. The history is complicated and
diverse; the culinary applications are innumerable.  When, where, and why have people been
eating eggs? <p>
<b>When?</b> Since the beginning of human time.<br>
<b>Where? </b>Wherever eggs could be obtained. Differerent kinds of eggs were/still are eaten
in
different parts of the world. Ostrich and chicken are the most common.<br>
<b>Why? </b>Because eggs are relatively easy to obtain, excellent protein sources, adaptable to
many
different types of recipes (from simply boiled, fried, or stuffed to complicated quiche, custards or
meringue), and fit the bill for meatless fasting days required by some religions. In this last role?
Eggs have been the object of much socio-religious symbolism and tradition. Over time, some
groups have encouraged the consumption/decoration of eggs in celebration of certain events. 
Others have decided eggs are filthy food which must avoided. None of this is arbitrary.
<p>
"It is likely that female game birds were, at some time in the early history of man, perceived as a
source both of meat and of eggs. Men discovered that by removing from the nest eggs that they
did not wish to have hatch (or that they simply wished to eat), they could induce the female jungle
fowl to lay additional eggs and, indeed, to continue to lay eggs throught an extended laying
season."
---<i>The Chicken Book</i>, Page Smith and Charles Daniel [University of Georgia
Press:Athens] 1975 (p. 11-12)
<p>
"Eggs have been known to, and enjoyed by, humans for many centuries. Jungle fowl were
domesticated in India by 3200 B.C.E. Record from China and Egypt show that fowl were
domesticated and laying eggs for human consumption around 1400 B.C.E., and there is
archaeoligical evidence for egg consumption dating back to the Neolithic age. The Romans found
egg-laying hens in England, Gaul, and among the Germans. The first domesticated fowl reached
North America with the second voyage of Columbus in 1493."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of Food and Culture</i>, Solomon H. Katz, editor, William Woys Weaver,
associate editor [Charles Scribner's Sons:New York] 2003, Volume 1 (p. 558)
<p>
<b>Why do we call them eggs?</b><br>
"The egg...tracks it name back to a prehistoric Indo-European source related to words for 'bird'...The Old English term was oeg, which survived in Middle English as ey (plural eyren)....But in the fourteenth century the related egg was borrowed from Old Norse. For a time the two forms competed with each other (William Caxton, in the prologue to his Book of Eneydos (1490), asked 'What should a man in these day now write, eggs  or eyren, certainly it is hard to please every man'), and the Norse form did not finally emerge as the winner until the late sixteenth century."
---An A-Z of Food & Drink, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxrod] 2002 (p. 117)
<p>
<b>How many different kind of eggs are there? </b><br>
Birds and reptiles lay eggs. Of these, some are consumed by humans. Preferences vary according to place, taste and economic conditions. <p>
"Eggs from many species of fowl (birds) have doubtless been consumed since the very beginning of humankind's stay on earth. In historical times, ancient Romans ate 
peafowl eggs, and the Chinese were fond of pigeon eggs. Ostrich eggs have been eaten since the day sof the Phoenicians, whereas quail eggs, as hard-cooked,
 shelf-stable, packaged prdoucts, are now featured on many gourmet food counters in the United States and Japan. Other eggs consumed by various ethnic groups
 include those from plovers, partridges, gulls, turkeys, pelicans, ducks, and geese. Turtle eggs have been highly prized, and in starvation situations, any eggs, even those 
of alligators, have been relied upon." <br>

<p>
<b>When did people start using eggs in baking and why? </b><br>
Food historians tell us the practice was ancient but they do not venture an exact place, date, or
reason. The
domestication of fowl (esp. chicken) greatly increased the availabiltiy of eggs to ancient peoples.
This is
thought by some to have begun in China in 6,000BC. About <a href="foodmeats.html#chicken">
chicken</a>.
<p>

Culinary evidence confirms breads and cakes using eggs were made by Ancient Egyptian and
Roman
peoples. The reason most often sited was the recognition that eggs worked as binding
(thickening) agents.
How did that begin? The food historians to not venture into this territory.
Possibly it was a discovery based on trial and error. Many foods and cooking methods (leavened
bread,
roasted meats, yogurt) were "invented"  this way.
<p>
"It is clear that Egyptians enjoyed their food. Nobles and priests were particularly well served,
with at least
forty different kinds of bread and pastries, some raised, some flat, some round, some conical,
some plaited.
There were some varieties made with honey, others with milk, still others with eggs."<br>
---<i>Food in History</i>, Reay Tannahill [Three Rivers Press:New York] 1988 (p. 53)
<p>
"Farming the prolific chicken has allowed us to make eggs a part of our diet without harming its
reproductive cycle. However, the very few ancient Greek recipes to mention eggs date from after
the time of
Pericles, when the chicken was introduced to Africa. It took some times for the habit of using
eggs in
cooking to catch on. We do hear of thagomata, made from egg whites, and various stuffings using
egg
yolks. On the other hand the classic cake offered as a sacrifice by the Romans, the libum, called
for one
egg to a pound of flour. In the Roman period pastry cooks made much use of eggs for desserts as
well as
cakes. Apicius (25 BC) invented baked custard: milk, honey and eggs beaten and cooked in an
eartheware
dish on gentle heat. Eggs really made their way into the kitchen with Apicius, who mentioned
them
frequently in the Ars Magirica. Beaten eggs were used as a thickening and to bind sauces and
ragouts;
hardboiled eggs became an ingredient of various dishes, sometimes with cheese, but here is no
evidence
that eggs were eaten just as they were, as a dish in themselves. This does not mean that they were
not so
eaten; it could simply indicate that they were not thought interesting enough for special
mention."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Egg symbolism</b></font><br>

"Because eggs embody the essence of life, people from ancient times to the modern day have surrounded them with magical beliefs, endowing them with the power
 not only to create life but to prophesy the future. Eggs symbolize birth and are believed to ensure fertility. They aslo symbolize rebirth, and thus long life and
even immortality. Eggs represent life in its various stages of development, encompassing the mystery and magic of creation. Creation myths commonly describe how the
universe was hatched from an egg, often laid by some mythical water bird swimming in the primordial waters...Early mythmakers viewed both the sun and the egg as the source
of all life; the round, yellow yolk even symbolized the sun. Clearly, eggs had great symbolic potential...In Europe of pagan and Christian times, eggs symbolized life and
resurrection. Human  being have long consumed eggs of all sorts--of hens, ducks, geese, partridges, pigeons, pheasants, ostriches, peacocks, and other bird 
species. In legends, fairies consumed eggs of mythical birds such as the phoenix. People ate eggs for a variety of reasons. Some sought to absorb their magical 
properties by eating them. Others ate them to ensure fertility. In the Slavonic and Germanic lands, people also smeared their hoes with eggs, in the hope of
transferring the eggs' fertility to the soil...In Iran, brides and grooms exchange eggs. In seventeeth-century France, a bride broke an egg when she first entered her
new nome...The perception of eggs a symbols of fertility and embodiments of life force compelled people of certain cultures not only to shun them as food but to
avoild destroying them at all costs...Some people avoided eating eggs laid by their tribal totems; certain groups of aborigines in Australia...believed they descended
from the emu, so they placed strict taboos on eating eggs of these ancestral birds...Though people frequently forbade the eating of eggs, eggs were often used for
divining purposes. Their widespread use in divination likely stemmed from the belief that they symbolized life--particularly life in the future. The Chinese and certain tribal 
groups in souther Asia used the eggs of chickens or ducks to divine the future. One method involed painting the eggs, boiling them, and reading the patterns in 
their cracks. Another method involved tossing the eggs, and divining the future with eggs, a process known as oomancy...The concept of eggs as life symbols went hand in 
hand with the concept of eggs as emblems of immortality, and particularly the resurrection of Christ, who rose from a sealed tomb just as a bird breaks through an eggshell...
The Jews traditionally serve eggs at Passover as a symbol of sacrifice and rebirth."<br>
---<i>Nectar and Ambrosia: An Encyclopedia of Food in World Mythology</i>, Tamra Andrews [ABC-CLIO:Santa Barbara CA] 2000 (p. 86-7)
<p>
"Eggs were not really part of the diet until poultry-farming became common, and, when they did, those most usually consumed were hen's eggs...Was there some
taboo...on eating the eggs of the earlier domestic fowls? It depends on the sense in which the trm is used. Not necessarily a religious taboo, but more of an 
economic interdiction, since 'the egg is in the chicken, and the chicken is in the egg'. The Mossi of Burkina Faso in Africa have never troubled themselves with
such philosophical reflections, but simply emply common sense. They will not let their children eat eggs for fear they will become thieves. The idea is not that...he who
steals an egg will steal an ox...but because he who steals an egg is stealing a chicken. Poultry lives at large in the villages of Africa, laying eggs anywhere.
Children must therefore be prevented from eating future broods, which would be community property,...An egg unnecessarily stolen and eaten will never become a
chicken...Morever, and even more seriously, the spirits will be offended, for all the poultry the Mossi eat has first been sacrificed to the local tutelary spirits...The
Mossi are a special example. All over the world, form the dawn of time, eggs have been collected from birds' nests in times of need...In the Far East the egg is not so important
an item of diet as in Europe,...It is a luxury for the rich, with all the symbolic and philosphical connotations that might be expected...The dyed or painted egg...is an
Easter tradition of the Christian West which has proved particularly tenacious in Central Europe...The tradition of easter eggs coincides,...with a self-explanatory
universal symbol, in this case creation, rebirth and spring..."<br>
---<i>History of Food</i>, Maugelonne Toussaint-Samat, translated by Anthea Bell [Barnes and Noble Books:New York] 1992 (p. 355-362)
<p>
"Considering the strange biological history of the egg, it is not surpring that its symbolic power is rivaled only by that of the cock. In Egypt eggs were hung in the
temples to encourage fertility, and everywhere, of course, they have been associated with birth and renewal. The Hindu description of the beginning of the world saw
it as a cosmic egg. First hrere was nonbeing and then that nonbeing became existent and turned into an enourmous egg, which incubated for a year and then split
open, with one part silver and the other gold. The silver half became the earth; the gold, the sky; the outer membrane, mountains; the inner, mist and clouds; the 
veins were rivers, and the fluid part of the egg was the ocean, and from all of these came in turn the sun. In certain other religions the egg was equated with the sun
and the yolk was seen as a kind of mixture of earth and water..."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Why are eggs sold by the dozen?</b></font><br>

The number 12 has many symbolic meanings. In the Christian world, it is most closely associated with the number of Jesus' disciples. American embrace of the dozen
as standard measure descends from English roots. Our food history sources confirm 
retail eggs were sold by the dozen during Elizabethan times. They do not tell us why this standard was chosen, nor do they credit a specific person or place for making 
this decision. Colonial-19th century wholesale exchanges were conducted in boxes or bbl (bushelbarrels); no count provided. In the days of industrial food packaging, it 
makes sense for eggs to be sold in even increments from a practical standpoint. No "bakers dozen" in the egg carton. 
<p>
It is interesting to note some grocers through time argued eggs should properly be sold by weight, not count. Why? Because the actual size of the eggs were different. 
Today's egg sellers take this into account. Products are graded by size and grouped/packed/priced accordingly. While the dozen remains the standard for statistical
purposes, eggs are now sold to retail consumers in packs ranging from 6 to 18.

"In your comments upon the efforts to get rid of Spanish coin and give our decimal currency its proper position I have seen no suggestion concerning the disuse of dozens
 and grosses. As long as the fashion is to sell eggs and pen-knives and chissels and screws by the dozen, so long will the prices be computed in shllings and pence, and 
the fractions of cents be charged upon the purchaser. Manufactuers of articles who have been accustomed to put them up in dozens can do much to promote the use of 
decimal currency by putting them up in tens and hundreds. The price of a package will tehn readily indicate the price of a single article, and the nuisance of factions be 
avoided. There is no rational reason why twelve knives and forks, or teaspoons or cups and saucers should constitute a set, and that ten or twenty should, and no reason
 why screws cannot be put into papers of 100 as well as 144."<br>

"How to Pack Eggs. Receivers have a good deal of trouble with eggs that come in loose packages, have not been properly packed, and arrive more or less broken. When 
cases are not used, the barrel is the next best package. In packing, oats should not be used, because they are heavy and increase the cost of shipment, and the eggs
 are apt to work through, and coming in contact with one another, there is sure to be some breakage if great care is not taken. By using straw the eggs can be got through
 in good shape and are in suitable condition for reshipping, provided the proper rules have been followed. In using straw, see that it is clean and dry so that there will be no 
musty smell. The eggs should be laid with the ends toward the outside of the barrel. Betweeen each layer of eggs there should be a thick layer of straw. See that plenty of
 straw is placed between the eggs and the sides of the barrel. A barrel, if properly packed, should not have more than about sixty or sixty-five dozen. When the package is
 filled, place considerable straw over the top, put the head of the barrel in securely, and then mark the package plainly: Eggs, so many dozen; and all is complete, and a 
good condition is certain."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>What size were the eggs in Ancient Rome?</b></font><br>
Our food history sources offer much information on the production, consumption and preparation of poultry eggs in the  
Ancient world but scant references to size or weight. Those references suggest eggs came in different sizes. 
Then, as today, season, breed, feed, and cooping conditions played key roles. Primary agricultural accounts (Cato, Varro, Columella, Pliny) are your
best sources for researching this topic. 
<p>
"The quality of poultry in Roman Italy was distinctly below that of the well-established strains of to-day. The best hens laid
about 60 eggs. That eggs were smaller than to-day, may be inferred from the fact that Varro and Pliny give 25 as a suitable maximum
for a setting; Columella's figure is 21."<br>

large eggs to be produced crumble up red earth and mix it with their food."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Egg sizes the USA</b></font><br>
What size hen's egg was used to make a cake in the 1840s? Excellent question with no simple answer. Today's consumers find
eggs clearly marked with quality grades in different sizes. In the 1840s, many consumers found eggs under the chicken in the
family coop. Pre-industrial American cook books regularly acknowledge the relationship between fresh eggs and best product 
but are silent on size. Cook books focus on identifying "good" eggs, proper storage, and <a href="foodeggs.html#colonialeggs">preservation techniques</a>.
In those days, the size of chicken eggs depended upon breed, feed, season and cooping conditions. 
<p>
Recreating old recipes with modern products always poses special challenges. When eggs are on the shopping list, 
think small or medium. Timelining the evolution of USA egg sizes is interesting because
different standards were formulated by states, federal agencies, and companies at the same time. Most of these standards 
were voluntary, not mandated.
Below please find selected milestones based on grocer's notes, industry standards, government recommendations, domestic scientists, 
market advertisements and consumer advocates.

""There is a tendency for body size to be associated with egg size; that is, in any given flock the largest birds usually lay the largest eggs. Most poultry breeders and
 flock owners could do quite a bit toward increasing the average size of eggs laid by the flock as a whole by culling out the smallest birds every year. Among the 
birds that are left, those that lay very small eggs should be culled rather than used in the breeding pen. This is quite important because it has been found that pullets
 that lay very small eggs at commencement of laying are very likely to lay small eggs for the rest of the year. Also, it has been found that in many cases the heavier
 producers in a high-laying strain lay smaller eggs than the average producers. This is not to say that high production and good egg size cannot be combined in the 
same bird, for this has been accomplished a thousand times over by poultry breeders...One of the most important things to keep in mind in developing a strain noted 
for good egg size is to select males as breeders that are the sons of dams that lay a good-sized egg. The market standard is a 2-ounce egg, and that is why females 
qualifying for record of performance are required to lay 200 eggs or more averaging at least 2 ounces in weight."<br>

"What size eggs should you buy? Labeling of eggs by size as well as quality follows a suggested U.S. Department of Agriculture grading scheme. It is based on the
 weight of one dozen eggs, and it defines six sizes ranging from Jumbo down to Peewee. But most shoppers are confronted with only three descriptive sizes, and it 
is refreshing to be able to state that their meaning is much more specific than is usually the case on packages in the supermarket: Extra Large, 27 ounces per dozen, 
Large, 24 ounces per dozen, Medium, 21 ounces per dozen. The USDA standard suggest that, as long as the whole carton of eggs meets is minimum weight 
requirement, individual eggs may be 1/12 ounce below weight. Thus, a few eggs in a dozen labeled Large might weigh 1 11/12 ounces, but others would have to be 
heavier so that the average came to at least 2 ounces. New York's state law is much more rigid, and uniquely so among the 50 states. In New York no egg in a 
carton marked Large may weigh less than 2 ounces, and so the consumer would receive a slightly larger average egg in New York than in other states--if the law 
were enforced. But evidently the strict New York weight regulation is no more meaningful than the state's comparatively stringent quality tolerances. In CU's
 sampling, about 10% of the eggs graded weighed less than 2 ounces. As with quality, USDA-graded cartons same closer to the mark than company-graded
 cartons: Cartons below New York state weight minimum (Federal-state graded 6%, Company graded 14%). It looks as though you get larger quantity along with 
better quality by choosing USDA-graded eggs rather than company-graded ones. But with eggs the problem of quantity has another, more elusive side to it. Prices
 of various sizes of eggs fluctuate during the year. Especially in the late summer and fall, Small and Medium eggs are likely to be in plentiful supply and, ounce for 
ounce, may be a better buy than the Large eggs. The USDA has worked out a table for the guidance of shoppers, and some women might want to keep a copy of
 it in their purse for ready reference. Here it is: Assmuing a single quality grade, if Extra Large eggs cost 54 cents per doz., large eggs are a better buy at less than 47 
cents per doz. and Medium eggs are a better buy at less than 41 cents per doz."<br>

"Buying eggs has changed a lot in the past fifty years--and much for the better, too. It used to be that a farmer's wife had her own 
flock of laying hens. She fed them scraps, a bit of grain, and turned them out to 'pick' in summer. Even farmer who was in the business of 
producing eggs used pretty haphazard methods compared to today's standard of excellence...Today, the mass production of this very 
important food is strictly scientific, And you, the modern homemaker, benefit. Imperfect and low-quality eggs never even reach 
your supermarket. Now eggs can be sorted out according to size and quality, so that you know exactly what you are buying...Here are 
some simple guidelines: Each egg sizes has a minimum weight per dozen: Jumbo--1 lb., 14 oz., Extra Large--1 lb., 11 oz., Large-- 
1 lb., 8 oz., Medium--1 lb., 5 oz., Small--1 lb., 2 oz., Peewee--15 oz. The size does not affect the quality, but does affect the 
price. There are four grades of eggs: AA, A, B and C. Of these, AA and A are the best quality for all purposes, especially in 
recipes where appearance is important, such as poaching, hard-cooking in the shell and frying. Grade B eggs are suitable for use in 
scrambling, baking and recipes where they are mixed with other ingredients. In a high quality egg, the white is thick and stands 
up well around a firm, high yolk. Grade C eggs are rarely found in retail stores." <br>

"A reader of Harper's Weekly recently wrote a letter to the editor asking why big eggs cost more than little eggs. The letter said 
size-12 shoes or socks cost no more than smaller sizes, although they contain more material. It also said that if you buy 
foodstuffs other than eggs in bulk, it's their total weight, not their size but unit, that determines the price. What then, is 
the justification for charging more for jumbo eggs than for peewee eggs? The letter-writer suspects that the price 
difference just 
pays for the machines that sort the big ones from the little ones. Because Harper's Weekly has been laggard in answering the reader's 
question, we thought we would look into it. The answer is because big eggs cost more than little eggs because big eggs 
are laid by bigger hens. Pullets lay peewees and don't eat much. Old hens heading for the stewpot lay jumbos and eat a lot. 
That's what it comes down to--chicken feed. Still, we can't accept that as a good reason. It seems to us that the overall price of 
eggs might be lower if the egg people got rid of their sorting machines and sold their eggs by the pound--big and little ones together. 
The egg people agree that it might lower prices. But they won't do it. They won't do it because consumers have a hangup on big 
eggs. They think they're better than little eggs. They're not. In fact, the bigger the egg, the runnier it is. Little eggs 
hold together better and don't stream all over the frying pan...There is...no nutritional difference--big or little--between 
big and little eggs. That's myth. Just like the myth that it's worth paying more for brown eggs because they're tastier and more 
nutritious than white eggs. They're not. Brown eggs cost more than white eggs because they're laid by hens that are bigger at 
the same age--and eat more--than the hens that lay white eggs of exactly the same size. OK?" <br>

<b>Soft boiled eggs</b></font><br>
Food historians confirm <a href="foodeggs.html#boiled">boiled eggs</a> have been consumed from prehistoric times forward. Eggs timed in minutes are usually cooked in their 
shells. The hotter the water and longer the boil, the more solid the finished product. From ancient times forward, soft boiled eggs are generally 
regarded as easier to digest. They were prescribed for invalids and preferred by wealthier classes. Four minute eggs fall in the 
"soft-boiled" category. Poached and shirred eggs fall into the same general category, although their method
is more complicated and requires special equipment.
<p> 
<b>Medieval France: "soft-boiled" eggs were recommended for digestibility:</b><br>
"...The fourth difference between eggs likes in the [culinary] preparation that is given them for eating...Those that are cooked on 
hot coals may be hard or soft. The hard-cooked ones are gross and heavy, digest poorly in the stomach and engender crude 
humors...The soft cooked ones are the opposite, for they soften the belly and stay only briefly in the stomach; they relieve a 
dryness of the chest and lung. Those eggs that are between hard-and soft-cooked are unlike either and are better to eat than 
either. Poached eggs strengthen natural warmth, especially when they are cooked to neither hard nor soft, because the 
water eliminates their harmfulness, and they are better eaten that way than any other way. Fried eggs are the worst of all sorts of 
preparation because they are converted into bad humors and engender vapors and nausea, and consequently are bad to eat. Eggs that are eaten in a broth or 
with meat or in a similar was are to be praised or condemned depending on the substances with which they are combined: for if they are eaten with 
good spices, such as cinnamon, pepper and ginger, and with meat, they are digested better and nourish better..."<br>

One should boil eggs in water whilst stirring them without pause; for when stirred they do not congeal or thicken; they are better boiled in vinegar; for then they stay still more moist...This recipe reads oddly; it makes sense only if the eggs are warmed in the shell rather than truly boiled. The constantly jostling in the shell will minimize coagulation, although given enough time, the eggs will firm up. The instruction that eggs are moistened boiled in vinegar may refer to the fact that if an eggshell contains a crack, the egg can leach out and solidify.

If you want to hard-boil eggs, put them in simmering water and draw the pan to the side. Whether you want them hard- or soft-boiled, plunge them in cold water as soon as they are cooked and they will peel easily."

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Deviled eggs</b></font><br>
The origin of deviled eggs can't be attributed to one specific person, company, date or town. It is
a culinary amalgam of history and taste. The concept of deviled eggs begins with Ancient Rome.
Spicy stuffed eggs were known in 13th century Andalusia. The name is an 18th century invention. <p>Not long after the Ancient Greeks and Romans
domesticated fowl, egg dishes of all kinds figured prominently in cookery texts. Eggs were eaten
on their own (omelets, scrambled) and employed as congealing agents (custard, flan, souffles). 
The ancestor of  deviled eggs? Ancient Roman recipes for <a href="foodeggs.html#boiledeggs">boiled eggs</a> (to various degrees) eggs 
were generaly served with saucy spices poured on top. 
<p>
The first recipes for stuffed, hard-boiled were printed in medieval European texts.
These cooks stuffed their eggs with raisins, cheese and sweet
spices.
Platina's <de>De Honesta Voluptate</i> [15th century Italian text] instructs cooks
thusly:<blockquote>
<b>"28. Stuffed eggs</b><br>
Make fresh eggs hard by cooking for a long time. Then, when the shells are removed, cut the eggs
through the middle so that the white is not damaged. When the yolks are removed, pound part
with raisins and good cheese, some fresh and some aged. Reserve part to color the mixture, and
also add a little finely cut parsley, marjoram, and mint. Some put in two or more egg whites
withspices. When the whites of the eggs have been stuffed with this mixture and closed, fry them
over slow fire in oil. When they have been fried, add a sauce made from the rest of the egg yolks
pounded with raisins and moistened with verjuice and must. Put in ginger, cloves, and cinnamon
and heat them a little while with the eggs themselves. This has more harm than good in it."<br>

<p>
The practice of hard boiling eggs was popular in Tudor England:
"By the later sixteenth century the boiling of eggs in their shells in water had become a common
practice. Prepared thus they were more digestible that roasted eggs; but less so than poached
eggs, which always earned the highest praise form the medical men."<br>
---<i>Food and Drink in Britain</i>, C. Anne Wilson [Academy Chicago Publishers:Chicago]
1991 (p. 144)
<p>According to historic cookbooks, the practice of boiling eggs, extracting the yolks and
combining them with savory spices (mustard, cayenne pepper) and refilling the eggs with the
mixture was common in latter years of the 16th century and was the "norm" by the 17th.
<blockquote>
<b>"To Farce Eggs</b><br>
Take eight or ten eggs and boil them hard. Peel off the shells and cut every egg in the middle; then
out the yolks. Make your farcing stuff as you do for flesh, saving only you must put butter into it
instead of suet, and that a little. So done, fill your eggs where the yolks were, and then bring them
and seethe them a little. And so serve them to the table."<br>
---<i>The Good Housewife's Jewel</i>, Thomas Dawson, with an introduction by Maggie Black
[London 1596] (p. 86)
<p>
<b>"The Second Way</b><br>
Fry some parsley, some minced leeks, and young onions, when you have fried them pour them

eggs."<br>

are served today.

<b>Where the devil?</b>
<p>
According to the food historians the practice of "devilling" food "officially" began sometime
during the 18th century in England. Why? Because that was when the term "deviled," as it relates
to food, first shows up in print. The earliest use of this culinary term was typically associated with
kidneys & other meats, not stuffed eggs:
<p>
"Devil...A name for various highly-seasoned broiled or fried dishes, also for hot ingredients. 1786,
Craig "Lounger NO. 86 'Make punch, brew negus, and season a devil.'"<br>
---<i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> (the 1786 reference is the first use of this word in print.
Words are often part of the oral language long before they appear in print).
<p>
"Devil--a culinary term which...first appeared as a noun in the 18th century, and then in the early
19th century as a verb meaning to cook something with fiery hot spices or condiments...The term
was presumably adopted because of the connection between the devil and the excessive heat in
Hell...Boswell, Dr Johnson's biographer, frequently refers to partaking of a dish of "devilled
bones" for supper, which suggests an earlier use."<br>
---<i>The Oxford Companion to Food,</i> Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford]
1999 (pages 247-248).<br>
[James Boswell lived from 1740-1795, Dr. Johnson's biography was published in 1791]
<p>
"Deviled...Any variety of dishes prepared with hot seasonings, such as cayenne or mustard. The
word derives from the association with the demon who dwells in hell. In culinary context the
word first appears in print in 1786; by 1820 Washington Irving has used the word in his
<i>Sketchbook</i> to describe a highly seasoned dish similar to a curry. Deviled dishes were very
popular throughout the nineteenth and into the twentieth centuries, especially for seafood
preparations and some appetizers."

"Around 1868, Underwood's sons began experimenting with a new product created from ground
ham blended with special seasonings. The process they dubbed "deviling," for cooking and
preparing the ham, was new. But best of all, the taste was unique. Soon thereafter, the
"Underwood devil" was born."<br>

<p>
<b>Many early 19th century devilling recipes were for meat and other items:</b><blockquote>
Devilled Biscuits...Butter some biscuits on both sides, and pepper them well, make a paste of
either chopped anchovies, or fine cheese, and spread it on the biscuit, with mustard and cayenne
pepper, and grill them."<br>
---<i>The Jewish Manual</i>, by A Lady [London:1846] (p. 98)
<p>
"Devilling, Or broiling with cayenne, is also a good expident to coax the palate when you have
relics of poultry of game. Fish can likewise be "devilled," or egged and fried with a small piece of
butter and bread crumbs, mixed with a little dried tyme, marjoram, and fresh parsley crumbled and
chopped very fine."<br>
---<i>The Dinner Question, or How to Dine Well and Economically</i>, Tabitha Tickletooth,

<p>
Recipes for deviled eggs have changed with time, probably a result of culinary fads and ingredient
availabilty. Compare the following:
<p><blockquote>
<b>[1882]<br>
"Devilled Eggs</b><br>
Boil six or eight eggs hard; leave in cold water until they are cold; cut in halves, slicing a bit of the
bottoms to make them stand upright, a la Columbus. Extract the yolks, and rub to a smooth paste
with a very little melted butter, some cayenne pepper, a touch of mustard, and just a dash of
vinegar. Fill the hollowed whites with this, and send to table upon a bed of chopped cresses,
seasoned with pepper, salt, vinegar, and a little sugar. The salad should be two inches thick, and
an egg be served with a heaping tablespoonful of it. You may use lettuce or white cabbage instead
of cresses."

enough gravy to cover them. Gravy a la Diable will be found excellent; but a plainer one can be
made on the same principle by using a cheaper stock. A few drops of anchovy sauce is an
improvement. Serve as soon as the eggs are hot throught, sith strips of dry toast, or put croutons
round the dish.(p. 594)<p>

a teaspoonful of French mustard, a dessertspoonful of Worcester sauce, and a little soluble
cayenne, with salt to taste, and a few drops of soy. Mix the thickening with the claret, and the rest
of the ingredients, and boil for a few minutes. Serve with kidneys, steaks, &etc., or with grilled
fish. For a hotter sauce, increaes the Worcester sauce, or boil a few capsicum seeds in the gravy."

<p>
<b>[1908]<br>
"Devilled Eggs</b><br>
Boil eggs twenty minutes and when cool shell. Cut into halves crosswise and remove the yolks
without breaking the whites. Put the whites of the same egg together, that they need not get
separated. The yolks may be put in the bowl. Whe all are cut, rub the yolks to a c ream with
melted butter, add a little made mustard or sauce from the chow chow bottle a little pickle or
pilces and salt and paprika to season. Fill the mixture into the whites, put the halves together as
they belong, and as if preparing them for the picnic basket fasten together with a couple of little
Japanese wooden tooth picks before wrapping in waxed paper. The picks serve as handles in
eating. If they are to be put on the home table press the halves together and arrange on a bed of
cress or lettuce. For a change, finely minced meat highly seasoned is often added to the yolks. The
devilled mixture that will be left over makes a spicy filling for sandwiches. Another way of using
devilled eggs is to spread the yolk mixture left over on a shallow baking dish, place the eggs on it
and cover with a thin cream sauce, veal or chicken gravy. Sprinkle with buttered crumbs and bake
until the crumbs are delicate brown. A grating of cheese may be incorporated with the crumbs, if
desired."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Dried eggs</b></font><br>
The earliest reference we find for dried egg albumen (aka desiccated eggs, dried eggs) in USA print is from the 1880s. 
Newspaper articles suggest this product was invented to combat fresh egg shortages. A detailed description of this product in a 
grocer's hand book [1883] suggests the item was readily available but not widely known. In the 1920s dried eggs became the focus of national 
attention when imports became big business. Tariffs were legislated to protect domestic producers. Anti-Chinese sentiments were expressed. We assume some of these products were imported from that country. One decade later, California 
producers were building factories to capitalize on growing consumer demands. 
<p>
From the beginning, commercial baking and confectionery concerns composed the largest market for dried egg products. Cheaper, 
more stable, and easier to store than fresh eggs, dried counterparts were readily embraced. The earliest print reference we find for 
the use of dried egg albumen in <a href="foodeggs.html#driedggeicing">royal icing</a> is from the early 1920s.

"One of the most remarkable features of the market at present is the high price of eggs. They have not been dearer since the last 
war. The supply is light-scarcely sufficient to meet the demand from the hotels, restaurants, and the bakers of the City. 
Desiccated eggs, and everything else that can be used as a substitute for cooking purposes, are brought into requisition. Choice 
fresh eggs from near points are worth 70 to 75 cents per dozen; those bought from the interior of this State and the West by 
express trains, 55 to 60 cents, and limed eggs 50 cents and upward." <br>

"A process has been devised by which the freshness of the egg is said to be maintained for years, resisting the 
injurious effects of climate. It consists of the crystallization or desiccation of the egg, changing it into an amber-hued vitreous 
substance, or consolidated mass of yolk and albumen, and materially reducing its bulk. When wanted for use, it is restored to its 
original condition by adding the water which has been artificially removed. No salt or other foreign matter, it is said, is 
employed in this process; for which the further merit is claimed that an egg ever so slightly tainted cannot be treated by it at all, and the 
wholesomeness of the prepared product is thus assured." <br>

"In the general discussion of the new tariff bill there is one time that has received by little publicity yet which is of 
great importance to California...The duty on eggs is important to this State because of its status as an egg-producing center. 
'Desiccated eggs (dried and frozen) are used by the bakery and confectionery trade and the importation of these two products is 
considerable,' it was stated. 'According to the bureau of agricultural economics of the United States Department of 
Agriculture, the imports of dried eggs whole, yolks and egg albumen, for the months of January and February of this year were 
1,021,663 pounds, while that of the frozen product amounted to 713,226 pounds. 'From these figures...it will be seen that the

each months of the year, and to stabilize the egg market when there is overproduction, and fresh egg markets are more ore less weak. 
The desiccated egg is the next thing in line in the way of large production for commercial use, Zoraster said today and it will be 
in keeping with a move that is being felt in various parts of the state. California's new egg law goes into effect in 
November. Already a desiccating plant has been opened at Hayward, and its output passed upon as up to standards required 
of foodstuffs. These plants are soon to be established in various sections where egg production is largest. San Fernando 
Valley is rated as the largest center in Southern California with Fontana next. Zoraster says that for home use the fresh egg will 
always be in demand for ham-and-eggs and scrambled eggs and boiled eggs and the like, but that more and more, large commercial bakers and 
other food manufacturers are leaning toward the use of the desiccated egg for numerous economic reasons, and that in time 
the dried egg will become as widely used as powdered milk and other dehydrated staple commodities." <br>

"Egg albumen. This is a product of many different grades. Two ounces of good grade of egg albumen to a pint of water is equal to 1 1/2 
dozen egg whites. With the poorer grades of egg albumen it will take three ounces in a pint of water to equal this same amount of 
egg whites. Although it is necessary to thoroughly soak egg albumen in order to dissolve, it should never be left in water for 
over 15 hours as it stagnates and ferments, and in this condition in impossible to use." <br>

"Albumen is a mixture of proteins in the white of eggs. That from hen eggs is the best quality. For commercial purposes the egg 
white is evaporated at a low temperature and the dried albumen is sold as yellowish flakes or as a coarse granular powder. Before 
use it requires soaking as it dissolves rather slowly in water. Great care must be exercised if any heat is applied as coagulation 
commences at 140 degrees F. (60 degrees C.). For most purposes, such as for frappe to be used in nougat, marshmallow, fondant 
cream or royal icing, a 10% solution is made. This has good foaming qualities and the foam remains stable when heated. It should be 
noted, however, that if the frappe is heated to above 140 degrees F...before beating is complete, it will be impossible to 
incorporate any more air and it is quite likely that the foam already made will collapse. Like other agglutinants referred to in 
this section, the solution will deteriorate rapidly and therefore only as much as is required for one or at the most two days 
should be made. During the War the supply of egg albumen was restricted, and many experiments were made to find satisfactory 
substitutes. There are now several products on the market and in the use of these the manufacture's instructions should 
be followed closely." <br>

(so much so, we hunted down his original references & reprinted them below) was authored by Gregory Beyer and published by <i>The New York Times</i>, c. 2007:

"The story of eggs Benedict is a hard one to tell. The beginning is shady at best, the main character has a hangover, and there are decades when
 nothing much happens. But the genre is certain, and the setting clear: Eggs Benedict is a mystery rooted in a long-vanished version of New York.
 Despite the dish's twisted history, it provides a link to one of the city's more glamorous eras. Of eggs Benedict's origins, much has been said, but
 little has been settled. Key witnesses are long dead. One cookbook contradicts another. Even the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> shrugs:
 'Origins U.S.'...And while there are several eggs Benedict creation myths, some of which may be the subject of discussion among aficionados on 
National Eggs Benedict day...April 16, they share decidedly genteel roots: rich and distinguished New Yorkers, fabulous New York restaurants and 
an adventurous 19th-century dining culture unfettered by contemporary concerns about trans fats and cholesterol. If there is a starting point to 
the debate over the provenance of this quintessential brunch dish, it would be 1942. That was the year The New Yorker published an article about 
a stockbroker named Lemuel Benedict and a breakfast order he had placed nearly 50 years earlier, in 1894, at the old Waldorf hotel at Fifth 
Avenue and 33rd Street. By 1931, when the hotel, renamed the Waldorf-Astoria, moved to its current location on Park Avenue, eggs Benedict had 
been enshrined as a classic American dish...By all accounts, Lemuel Benedict was a dashing ladies' man, typically outfitted in fine dark suits and 
high white collars...His name appeared often in newspaper society columns, and he had a reputation for leaving huge tips at New York's finest
 restaurants...Although Lemuel Benedict had a hangover that morning in 1894, the New Yorker article recounted, he didn't shy away from 
breakfast. He ordered two poached eggs, bacon, buttered toast and a pitcher of hollandaise sauce, a rich, egg-based sauce flavored with butter, 
lemon and vinegar. Then he built the dish that bears his name. Lemuel's innovation attracted the attention of Oscar of the Waldorf, as the maitre
 d'hotel there was widely known. He promptly tested it and put the item on the menu, although Oscar's version substituted ham for bacon and an 
English muffin for toast..Lemuel benedict reveled in the attention and prestige that resulted from his breakfast order. But his original request had 
specified toast, and he never warmed to the idea of English muffins...Lemuel Benedict died at age 76 in 1943, less than a hear after the <i>New 
Yorker</i> article was published The article had, however, caught the attention of Jack Benedict, a real estate salesman from Colorado who was the
 son of Lemuel's first cousin. As other stories about the creation of eggs Benedict surfaced, Jack Benedict's interest in the dish grew into 
full-fledged activism and, eventually, obsession. He became dedicated to the task of making sure that his dead relative got credit for his famous
 breakfast order. Jack Benedict was particularly upset by an article published in March 1978 in <i>Bon Appetit</i> magazine titled 'Perfect Eggs Benedict,
' which credited a Mr. and Mrs. LeGrand Benedict as the founders of the dish. According to <i>Bon Appetit</i>, the couple requested the ingredients one 
morning around the turn of the last century at Delmonico's...The article noted that one account credited the dish's creation to a young man with a 
hangover at the Waldorf, but in an error that must have further inflamed Jack Benedict, it referred to the young man not as Lemuel Benedict but 
Samuel. And in 1894, the year Lemuel placed his order at the Waldorf, the legendary's chef Charles Ranhofer published a huge cookbook called 
<i>The Epicurean</i> that included and almost identical recipe, Eggs a la Benedick. The LeGrand version of the eggs Benedict creation story came to 
eclipse the account offered in The New Yorker in many cookbooks and food reference books...One seeming hitch in the version that credits Oscar
 of the Waldorf, who plays such a key role in that account, never confirmed the story, despite ample opportunity to do so. Oscar had no aversion 
to publicity...But Oscar never mentioned eggs Benedict, either by name or by description...Some food historians are also skeptical about Jack 
Benedict's claims. 'It's not a 100 percent invented dish...it's an evolution...'" <br>

What interests us more than the actual "invention" of the dish (which, food historian Mark Zanger quite rightly points 
out [<i>American History Cookbook</i> (p. 139)]
 was known in <a href="foodeggs.html#1839benedict">1830s Kentucky</a>, is the "invention" of the story behind the dish.
According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, the earliest print reference to Eggs Benedict appeared in 1898: "Poached eggs...benedict, split and toast some 
small muffins; put on each a nice round slice of broiled ham, and on the ham the poached egg; our over some Hollandaise sauce." [A. Meyer, <i>Eggs & how to 
use Them</i>] . We agree with Mr. Zanger & Mr. Beyer: this recipe was not invented, it evolved. The oldest description we find for this dish predates the earliest 
creation legend by 50 years. None of the "creation" stories state a particular date. In the food world this is not unusual.
Doing the "math" on Lemuel's story places the dish in 1894. Food historians remind us the gap between "invention" and print
evidence can take years, if not decades.  Newspapers do the best job reporting new recipes & food trends. Magazines follow
close behind. Cookbooks us date general overall knowledge/acceptance of a particular dish/by name.

Place a broad stew-pan of clean water over the fire till it boils, and set it level before the fire. Break the eggs separately into a plate or saucer, to 
ascertain if they are good, dropping them as you examine them into the boiling water. They must not be too much crowded, and there must be 
plenty of water to cover them well. Having put them all into the pan in this manner, let them remain till the whites become set; then place the pan
 again on the fire, and cook them as hard as you desire: they probably will be sufficiently hard by the time the water begins to boil. Raise them 
carefully from the water with an egg-slice, trimming the edges smoothly, and lay them separately upon small buttered toasts or broiled ham, 
arranging them neatly in the dish; sprinkle on a very little salt and black pepper; put on each a spoonful of melted butter, and send them up warm. 
They are eaten at breakfast. When prepared for the dinner table, omit the toasts or ham; serve them in a small deep dish, sprinkle on some salt

"Forty-eight years ago a young blade named Lemuel Benedict came into the dining room of the old Waldorf for a late breakfast. He had a hangover 
(the statute of limitations permits the publication of the libel), but his brain was clicking away in high gear. He ordered some buttered toast, crisp 
bacon, two poached eggs, and a hooker of hollandaise sauce, and then and there proceeded to put together the dish that has, ever since, borne 
his name. Oscar of the Waldorf got wind of this unorthodox delicacy, tested it, and put it on his breakfast and luncheon menus, with certain 
modifications. Oscar's version of Eggs Benedict substituted ham for bacon and a toasted English muffin for toasted bread. Be advised that this 
perversion is not approved by the originator, who now lives in sedate retirement near Stamford, Connecticut, writing political articles, Republican in 
tone, for the local newspaper and puttering around with amateur cookery. 'English muffins are unpalatable, no matter how they are toasted or how 
they are served,' he says. To the best of our knowledge, Mr. Benedict is the sole surviving epicure of those who have given their names to great 
recipes. Dame Nellie Melba is gone; so is Newburg (nobody knows much about him) and Tom Collins (nobody knows anything about him). Naturally,
 this statement ignores Reuben's sandwiches, which impart but a fleeting flame. Benedict's has been a full and happy life, crowned just lately by 
the election of Mrs. Luce. He was a stockbroker for thirty-eight years, selling his seat and retiring at a good time--1927. His happiest memories, 
however, are gastronomical rather than financial. For example, he remembers W. K. Vanderbilt's chef, the great Joseph, who was paid fifteen 
thousand a year and who claimed he put terrapin in a more cheerful frame of mind and improved their flavor by reading a newspaper to them 
before dropping them in the soup. Mr. Benedict told us vivid tales of the Broadway lobster palaces, of get-togethers at Delmonico's with Diamond 
Jim Brady and Lillian Russell, and of informal Sunday afternoons at his own home, with Schumann-Heink or Caruso eating his food and 
spontaneously bursting into song. Mr. Benedict occasionally visits New York, but it's not the same. About the only landmark left for him is the 
Racquet Club. After having achieved some really good cooking, we Americans have retrogressed to the point of eating hamburgers, drinking 
between meals, and taking our mistresses and wives to dine at the same places--all, in Mr. Benedict's eyes, equal crimes." <br>

According to a well-founded report, two of the regular customers were Mr. and Mrs. LeGrand Benedict. One Saturday at lunch, Mrs. Benedict complained that
 there was nothing new on the menu, so the maitre d'hotel asked what she might suggest. Out of their colloquy came the now internationally famous recipe: toasted
 English muffins topped with a thin slice of ham and poached eggs, with hollandaise sauce over all."<br>

"Eggs Benedict</b> is conceivably the most sophisticated dish ever created in America. Oddly enough, its origins are little-known. They certainly had been obscure 
to this department until the arrival not long ago of a letter from an American residing in France. The writer, Edward 
P. Montgomery, expressed the hope that once and for all a recipe for the genuine article might be offered the public. He cringes at the thought of what passes for 
the dish in most American restaurants, a 'concoction of an overpoached egg on a few shreds of ham on a --ugh!--soggy tough half of an English muffin with an 
utterly tasteless hollandaise...' Mr. Montgomery related that the dish was created by Commodore E.C. Benedict. It was from his kitchen that the dish gained its
 fame. The commodore, a noted banker and yachtsman, died in 1920 at the age of 86. The recipe here was given to Mr. Montgomery by his mother, who in turn
 had been given it by her brother, a friend of the Commodore. 'To get the hollandaise, eggs, toast and ham assembled when they are at point is,' Mr. Montgomery 
says, 'a real trick.'

"To the Editor: I am writing to correct the statement by Edward 
P. Montgomery concerning the origin of Eggs Benedict, as reported recently by Craig Claiborne. The true story, well known to the relations of Mrs. LeGrand Benedict, of whom I am one, is as follows. Mr. and Mrs. Benedict, when they lived in New York around the turn of the century, lunched every Saturday at Delmonico's. One day Mrs. Benedict said to the maitre d'hotel, 'Haven't you anything new or different to suggest?' On his reply that he would like to hear something new from her, she suggested poached eggs on toasted English muffins with a thin slice of ham, hollandaise sauce and a truffle on top. This recipe has bone around the world. Commodore E. C. Benedict, who was given the credit, was a cousin and undoubtedly enjoyed these eggs, but it would have been unlike him to have called them his inventions. The name is occasionally given, erroneously, as 'Eggs Benedictine.'--Mabel C. Butler, Vineyard Haven, Mass."<br>

"Reports of [Egg Benedict] vary. Eggs Benedict has been attributed to a Commodore E.C. Benedict, a noted yachtsman, bon vivant and crony of 
President Grover Cleveland; to a Mrs. LeGrand Benedict, an inveterate luncher at Delmonico's, and to a certain Samuel [sic] Benedict, a night owl, 
said to have ordered the dish from the famed Oscar of the Waldorf-Astoria, to soothe a horrendous hangover. M. E. Marshall, who wrote a whole 
book on egg recipes, The Delectable Egg, called it one of the 'timeless classic egg dishes,' and vague credence to the legend that the dish was
 created in the Vatican kitchen for Pope Benedict XIII in the eighteenth century. One anecdote has it that Commodore Benedict created Eggs 
Benedict in his own kitchen. The Commodore died in 1920 at the age of 86, which speaks well for the healthful properties of the dish. From an 
authoritative source, Mrs. Mabel C. Butler, of Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts, a relation of Commodore Benedict, we get a different account. She 
vouches that Mr. and Mrs. LeGrand Benedict, who were related to both the Commodore and herself, were fond of eating at Delmonico's. During one 
luncheon, Mrs. Benedict asked the maitre d'hotel if he could suggest something new and different. The matrie d', it seems, wasn't too imaginative 
and tossed the poser back to Mrs. Benedict--who then proceeded to improvise the dish. On French menus, especially in the United States, Eggs 
Benedict is sometimes mistakenly listed as Eggs a la Benectine--quite a different dish, although poached eggs are part of its ingredients...Chefs in 
various parts of the country have their own ideas about preparing Eggs Benedict. At the famous Windows on the World, on the 107th floor of 
Manhattan's World Trade Center, the eggs are poached in advance, kept warm, then set on beds of spinach and artichoke hearts. no ham is used, 
but the whole affair is topped with the traditional hollandaise sauce." <br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Floating Islands</b></font><br>
Food historians generally agree Floating Island desserts originated in 18th century France. They do not credit a specific chef for the invention. Chef-linguists 
confirm the relationship between French Snow Eggs (Oeufs a la neige) and Floating Island (Ile Flottante). In both cases, the critical
 ingredient is whisked egg whites, also known as <a href="foodpies.html#meringue">meringue</a>. Escoffier <a href="foodeggs.html#1903">[1903]</a> helps us understand the difference by including both recipes in his Guide Culinaire.
<p>
Elizabethan-era English Snow (cream, eggs)  is a different dessert. Here egg whites are whipped into the cream to achieve a fluffy white appearance, not necessarily floating 
in a sea of custard. By the 18th century, Snow recipes disappear from English cookbooks. They are replaced with French Floating Islands. This 
suggests an evolving English palate. Mrs. Beeton's Snow Eggs <a href="foodeggs.html#1861">[1861]</a> are most definately French. Our survey of historic recipes illustrates the complicated 
relationship between of these three recipes as told through ingredients, method and presentation. 
<p>
<b>What is Floating Island?</b><br>
"Floating island (in French ile flottante) is a cold dessert consisting of a round flat baked meringue 'island' floating on a sea of custard...It is very close in 
conception to, and sometimes confused with, the French dish oeufs a la neige, 'snow eggs', in which the beaten egg whites are formed into small individual masses,
 not one large one, poached rather than baked, and then placed on a top of a light egg custard."<br>---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:

<b>Hangtown Fry</b><br>
We are naturally drawn to recipes with interesting names. Hangtown Fry is one of them. The legend(s) are fun. The evolution of the dish is common sense.
<p>
<b>The legend behind the name</b><br>
"In early 1849 a French miner claimed two Mexicans robbed him of his gold, and others accused the same men of being horse thieves. A mob hung the accused from an oak tree in the center of the 
settlement, which then acquired the name Hangtown. Community leaders soon renamed the town Placerville but the colorful name stuck. In 1850 the El Dorado Hotel and Saloon opened on that same
square, next to the infamous oak tree. The hotel restaurant gained fame for its excellent food...Legends ay one day some happy miner at the El Dorado demanded the most expensive dish possible. The cook satisfied him with
a scramble of eggs ad oysters."<br>

[NOTE: Ms. Peters traces the earliest recipe for Hangtown Fry to <a href="foodeggs.html#hangtown1919">Victor Hirtzer</a>, 1919.]
<p>
Our survey of historic newspapers, including <i>The Mountain Democrcat</i> [Placerville CA, 1854+] the confirms oysters & eggs were indeed 
popular, expensive, and readily available to people with money in California (coastal San Francisco & landlocked: Hangtown, Placerville, Sacramento) in the 1850s. Local hotel restaurant
menus and grocery store ads feature eggs and oysters. Sometimes in combination. Dishes composed of oysters and eggs were not uncommon. Think: oyster omelets and
oyster scrambled eggs. Pre-WWII references & recipes to Hangtown Fry are not uncommon in California
sources. A popular 1949 state-by-state cookbook, published 100 years after the initial find at Sutter's Mill, might be the key to unlocking modern genesis of this legend. Soon thereafter
the details were embellished. In 1952 Helen Evans Brown pronounced Hangtown Fry as "most famous of our oyster dishes" in her <i>West Coast Cook Book</i>. Ms. Brown offers two legends, without comment or credit.

<blockquote>
<b>[1857]<br>
"Oyster Omelet.</b>--Having strained the liquor from twenty-five oysters of the largest size, mince them small; omitting the hard part or gristle. If you cannot get 
large oysters, yoou should have forty or fifty small ones. Break into a shall pan six, seven, or eight eggs, according to the quantity of minced oysters. Omit half the whites, and
(having beaten the ggs till very light, thick, and smoothh,) mix the oysters gradually into them, adding a little cayenne pepper, and some powdered nutmeg. Put three ounces or
more of the best fresh butter into a small frying-pan, if you have no pan especially for omelets. Place it over a clear fire, and when the butter, (which should be previously
cut up,) has come to a boil, put in the omelet-mixture; stir it till it begin to set; and fry it light brown, lifting the edge several times by slipping a knife under it,
and taking care not to cook it too much or it will shrivel and become tough. When done, clap a large hot plate or dish on the top of the omelet, and turn it quickly and
carefully out of the pan. Serve it up immediately. It is a fine breakfast dish. This quantity will make one large or two small omelets..."<br>

<p>
<b>[1890]<br>

Drain twelve oysters and remove the hard part. Beat four eggs without separating until the white and yolks are thoroughly mixed, add four tablespoons of warm water. See that your

melted and the pan is yot, add the oysters to the eggs, turn the whole into the hot pan, shake over a good fire until the eggs are set in the bottom, then lift the side of the

"The story of gold mining in the Placerville district is told in a book to be off the press shortly, 'Pay Dirt,' by Glenn Chesney Quiett. This volume, which is to be published by 
D. Appleton-Century Company, gives a panoramic picture of all the gold rushes that have taken place in the United States and Canada. Beginning with the current revival of gold
mining and the panning and sluicing of gravel in gold-bearing streams which has recently attracted so many amateurs, the book takes up the whole romantic story of the search for
gold in America. Although it is an historically accurate record of American gold mining, the book is written in narrative stype. Mr. Quiett tells how Placrville, as Hangtown, gave
its name to that still popular dish, 'Hangtown Fry."<br>

"Hangtown Fry.</b><br>
This most famous of our own oyster dishes, dates back to the days of the Argoauts. That we know, but we don't know just exactly how it got its nae--it's too good a one not to be started many
yarns a-spinning. A sure guess is that it had something to do wit the town of that name (Hangtown was renamed Placerville to appease some of its more fastidious 
citizens). One story is that a man about to be hanged asked that his last meal be 'fried oyster with scrambled eggs on top and bacon on the side.' A story that seems more
likely that the dish was named after Nick 'Hangtown,' whose name was acquired when he cooked for Mr. Studebaker, the wheelbarrow king, in Hangtown. (Mr. Studebaker was quite 
busy laying the foundation of his family's fortune.) Later Nick went to Collins & Wheeland in San Francisco where he became the cook, and introduced his famous oyster dish.
The shucked oysters are dried dusted with flour, dipped in beaten egg which has beem seasoned with salt and pepper then rolled in cracker crumbs and browned on both 
sides in butter, not more than a minute on each side. Beaten seasoned eggs are poured over the oysters and allowed to set, then turned, oysters ad all, and browned on the other
side. (About 4 medium oysters and 2 eggs to each serving.) This is served with bacon, and often fried onions and/or fried green peppers are an extra embellishment. An even simpler way to make
this famous dish is to mix scrambled eggs with fried oysters and serve!<br>

"The legend of the origin of Hangtown
Fry, a combination of oysters and eggs, may or many not be true, but it is an interesting shred of Caliornia Gold Rush history. A man condemed to the gallows in Hangtown, now less picturesquely nnamed Placerville, was
asked what he wished for his last meal. He promptly answered eggs and oysters, perhaps with a description of how they were to be prepared. Historians suspect the victim's
request was aimed as much at saving his neck as at gastronomic delight. Getting fresh eggs and oysters could delay the hanging some days, maybe long enough for Gold Rush Law to 
temper the sentence."<br>

<b>Shirred eggs</b><br>
Our survey of historic dictionaries, word history sources, cook books, culinary encyclopedias and newspapers confirms the general launch date of the term “shirred 
eggs” but not the origin of the term. In sum:<ul>
<li> The word originated in the USA; origin "obscure" or "unknown."
<li> The earliest applications applied to rubberized textiles & sewing [1847] 
<li> The word can be a noun, adjective or verb. 
</ul>

The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, the adjective "shirred," as it applies to cookery, first surfaces in the late 19th century:<br>
"3. Cookery. (See quot. 1892.)

<br>
The verb "shirring" also appears about this time:<br>
"2. Cookery. ‘To poach (eggs) in cream instead of water’ (Cent. Dict. 1891)."<br>
<p> 
"An American way of cooking eggs: the eggs are broken into a cup or small bowl, covered with milk or cream and often breadcrumbs, and baked. It is not clear where the term (first recorded in 1883) 
came from, nor how it is related to the verb shirr ‘to gather fabric by means of parallel threads’."<br>

Many persons have asked the writer what the difference is between shirred eggs and eggs au miroir. Accordig to the modern school of thought, the difference is as follows:
Shirred eggs ae cooked in a small china dish, especially made for the purpose, and are served therein; while eggs au miroir are also cooked in the same kind of dish, but when done they
are cut with a round paste cutter, and served either on toast, rusts, or the garnishing directly. These are the teachings of the over-refined modern school. In the
good old days no difference was made between a shirred egg and an egg au miroir. In cooking shirred eggs, butter the dish lightly, break into it either three or four
eggs, pour hot melted butter over the yolks, and cook in a slow oven for a few minutes, until the yolks look as though they are covered with a veil. The seasoning of eggs, if 
no sauce accompanies them, should be left to the eater, as salt and pepper destroy the beauty of a well cooked egg."<br>

<a name="snow">
<b>What was English Snow?</b><br>
"...the greatest innovation [of Elizabethan-era cooking] was the discovery of eggs as a raising agent in cookery. Whites 
of eggs produced the Elizabethan 'dishful of snow', a spectacular centrepiece for the banquet course following a festal
 meal. They were beaten with thick cream, rosewater and sugar until the froth rose, and the latter was gathered in a 
colander, and then built up over an apple and 'a thick bush of rosemary' on a platter. In some versions the snow was 
gilded as a final touch. The beating of egg whites was not altogether easy before the fork came into common use in the 
late seventeenth century...A 1655 recipe for 'cream with snow' suggested a cleft stick, or 'a bunch of reeds tied 
together, and roll between your hands standing upright in your cream'. For the dishful of snow was still being made under
 the name of 'cream with snow' (it had lost the rosemary and the gilt), and as 'snow cream' or 'blanched cream' it 
continued into the eighteenth century. A variant form with the addition of apple pulp came to be known as 'apple snow'. 
The same recipe was made up with other fruits in season. Syllabubs were also produced on occasion from cream reinforced by
 white of egg to enhance their light, frothy texture."<br>

<b>What is an omelette?</b><br>
According Alan Davidson's <i>Oxford Companion to Food</i> [Oxford University Press:Oxford]
1999
(p. 550, 553), the word  omelette" is of French origin and came into use during the mid-16th
century. Somewhat similar egg dishes were known to and ancient medieval cooks. Mr. Davidson
traces the origins of the omelette to ancient Persia. We know the Ancient Romans often combined
eggs and dairy products into patinae, custards and a variety of other sweet and savory dishes. C.
Anne Wilson comments: "The precursor to the omlette in Britain was known as a herbolace and
in the late fourteenth century was a mixture of eggs and shredded herbs, baked in a buttered dish.
A contemporary French recipe under the same name is much more detailed, and gives instructions
for heating oil, butter or fat thoroughly in a frying pan before pouring in eight well-beaten eggs
(of medieval size) mixed with brayed herbs and ginger. The French version was finished off with
grated cheese on top, and appears to have been quite close to the modern concept of an
omelette."<br>---<i>Food and Drink in Britain From the Stone Age to the 19th Century</i>
[Academy Chicago Press:Chicago] 1991 ( p. 142).
<p>
<b>Why are they called omelettes?</b><br>
"The notion of cooking beaten eggs in butter in a pan is an ancient one...but omelette does not enter the English language until the early seventeenth century. It is first 
described by Randle Cotgrave in his <i>Dictionary of the French and English Tongues</i> (1611): Haumelette, an Omelet, or Pancake of egges.' Omelettes had then been made
 in France for two or three hundred years, and it is from French that we get their name. It has a complex history: it probably started out as lamella, a diminutive of lamina
 'thin plate'; this was borrowed into French, but by a misanalysis of la lemele...it became alemelle or alumelle. It seems this must at some point have had the common 
suffix -ette substituted for -elle, and the resulting alemette then had its first two consonants transposed...to give amelette. The word has had a variety of spellings in
 English, including amulet in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and emlett in the seventeenth century, and there iss till some variation: omelette is now the 
generally preferred form in British English, but the Oxford English Dictionary gave omelet precedence in 1902, and this is still the main American spelling."

<i>The Oxford English Dictionary</i> (Online version) adds:<br>
"Forms:16 ormlet, 16-17 omlet, 16- omelet, 17 omalade, 17-18 omlette, 18 omellette (irreg.), 18- omelette. . 16 ammulet, 16 emlett, 16-17 amelet, 16-17 amulet, 17 amlet. [< Middle French, French omelette (1561; also as  aumelette (1611 in Cotgrave)), alteration (see note) of Middle French, French amelette (1480; now regional), app. a variant (with metathesis) of an unattested Middle French form *alemette (cf. alumette (c1400), alumecte (first half of the 15th cent.)), itself in turn a variant (with suffix substitution) of alemelle, alumelle thin plate, blade of a sword or knife (second half of the 12th cent. in Old French as alemele, alumele; late 14th cent. as alumelle in sense ‘sweet fritter, perh. omelette’), ult. a variant (with metanalysis of the definite article) of lemelle blade (second half of the 12th cent. in Old French as lemele; French lamelle (early 15th cent. in Middle French)) < classical Latin lamella (see LAMELLA n.).
The change in the initial vowel from a to o prob. occurred in southern French under the influence of forms of  ufmollette (1576), French  ufmelete (1607),  ufmeslete (1615).] "
<p>
"The word comes from the French "lamelle" (thin strip)
because of its flat shape; previously it was known as  alumelle and then  alumette, and finally
 amelette. (Some authorities claim that the word has a Latin origin,  ova mellita, a classic
Roman dish consisting of beaten eggs cooked on a flat clay dish with honey.)..."<br>

Potter:New York]  2001 (p. 808)

<p>
"The etymology of the world omelette (homelaicte in Rabelais) is also very obscure, although the
dish itself goes back as far as the Romans. It is thought to derive ultimately from lamella,  a thin
plate, referring to the long, flat shape of the omelette, and to represent a gradual corruption of
[the word] allumelle first to allumelette, then to alomelette. <i>Le cuisinier francois</i> [a
cookbook] of
1651 has aumelette. Jean-Jacques Rousseau...had the dexterity and precision required to turn his
beaten eggs by tossing them in the air, like a pancake...
   <i>The Cuisine bougeoise</i> [another cookbook] of 1784 uses the modern form of the word,
omelette, carefully distinguishing between it and scrambled eggs, a new recipe of the time..."<br>

"7. An Herb Omelette</b><br>
The French name for this omelette, arboilaste, is merely a combination of the words 'herb' and 'aloumaste.' This latter part of the name, which
ends up as the modern 'omelette' (with the l and m exchanged), derived from the word lamina or lamella, meaning a thin plate; the word is decriptive,
evoking the appearance of a think plate-like omelette. Though the <i>Menagier</i> lists many ingredients for this dish, it is really just a simple herb and cheese
omelette. Some of the herbs specified by the old recipe are no longer in common usage. Because of their bitterness and strength, the
<i>Menagier</i> warns the cook to use very little amounts of dittany (a plant in the mint family) and of rue (so strong and bitter,
the author says, that it may even be omitted). Smallage (wild celery), tansy, mint and sage are also to be included only in small amongt. The
salad greens--chard, spinach, clary (a variety of sage) and violet leaves--the author directs to be used in about equal
portions...Typical of the practical concerns of the <i>Menagier</i> is his advise that the cheese be sprinkled on top of the egg/herb
mixture <i>after</i> it has been poured into the pan, in order to avoid having the cheeese stick to the bottom of the pan."<br>

"Omelettes.</b> The theory of the preparation of an omelette is both simple and at the same time very
complicated for the simple reason that people's tastes for this type of dish are very different--one
likes his omelette very well cooked, another likes it to be just done, and there are others who only
like their omelette when it is extremely soft and underdone. The important thing is to know and
understand the preference of the guest...In a few words, what is an omelette? It is really a special
type of scrambled egg enclosed in a coating or envelope of coagulated egg and nothing else. The
following recipes are for an omelette of 3 eggs each, of which the seasoning comprises a small
pinch of fine salt and a touch of pepper, and which requires 15g (1/2 oz) of butter for its
preparation."<br>

"The variety of omelets is infinite, considering that every kind of different ingredient can be added. These ingredients, previously
cooked, are either pug directly into the beaten eggs, which makes a <i>simple omelet</i>, or, added to the omelet before
folding it over in the pan. This is called 'filling' the omelete. You could, for a filled omelet, reserve a tablespoon of its
filling, and add it, as a kind of decoration, on top of the omelet before serving. Ork arrange it in a pyramid in the middle of the folded 
omelet, or place it in small pocket made into the middle of the omelete....<b>Plain Omelet (Omelet au Naturel)</b> This
consists of eggs seasoned only with salt and pepper, and,if possible, with a little cream added. So: 6 eggs, 2 tablespoons of cream, and

The art of <a href="foodfaq2.html#pickles">pickling</a>, as a preservation techique, is thousands of years old. 
Recipes evolved according to place and taste. While eggs have been preserved for future use using various

English/USA cookbooks is from the early 19th century.
<p>
"Vinegar pickling of all kinds of food suddenly became very popular in the sixteenth century in England,
when salted foods were losing favor and were gradually being relegated to the food of the poor. When the
English farmer's wife had a glut of eggs, she would boil then hard, shell them, and pile them into
earthenware or glass jars and over them scalding vinegar well seasoned with pepper, ginger, garlic, and
allspice. "The eggs are fit to use after a month" and were quite a treat in the farmhouse kitchen."<br>

"Scotch egg: a hard boiled egg enveloped in sausage meat and then fried. It is a popular cold snack, often eaten 
in pubs, or on picnics. Its origin is unclear although it could possible be a descendant of a form of 
Indian Kofta...the first printed recipe was in Mrs. Rundell (...1806), and suggests that the Scottish 
origin of the item was pointed up by its appearance in Meg Dods (1826), where it is described as 
being eaten hot with gravy, a practice also recorded by Mrs. Beeton (1861)." <br>

  What can we tell you about "scrambled" eggs?
  
  We know that Ancient Romans scrambled eggs (ie, broke the yolks and mixed them with the
  albumen), mixed them up with vegetables and spices, and baked them. These were the first
  <a href="foodeggs.html#omelettes">omelettes</a>.
<p>
Recipes and methods vary according to time, place and cook's taste. There is no one "official" recipe; but a plethora of
culinary choices. Eggs can be mixed together before cooking, extra ingredients (cream, water, butter, cheese, diced vegetables) may be introduced
at any time. Some cooks scramble at the end when the eggs are almost cooked; others prefer constant agitation. Should the final
product be yellow or white and yellow? One thing is for certain: on Western European and Americn tables, scrambled eggs were meant to be accompanied by hot buttered toast!
<p>
Scrambled eggs are perfect for breakfast, lunch (<a href="foodsandwiches.html#western">Western Sandwich</a>), main course (Egg Foo Young) and
midnight snack (24 hour diner fare).

"1296. Oeufs Rouilles--Scrambled Eggs</b><br>
This method of preparing eggs is undoubtedly the best, always bearing in mind that they should not be overcooked but be kept
soft and creamy. They are usually served in a small deep silver dish but according to the recipe are also presented in small Croustades,
cases made of hollowed-out Brioche or tartlet cases. Formerly it was the custom to surround the dish of scrambled eggs with
small Croutons of various shapes or pieces of cooked pale baked puff pastry in the form of crescents, diamonds, rounds or palm
leaves, etc.; this way has much to recommend it and can always be followed. In the old classical kitchen scrambled eggs were always 
cooked au Bain-marie as this guaranteed that they were cooked perfectly; but this was a time-consuming operation. They may be cooked 
more quickly by sing direct by gentle heat as a gradual cooking process is essential for obtaining the desired soft, smooth
texture.
<p>
Method of Preparation: Gently heat 50 g (2 oz) butter in a heavy small pan, add 6 beaten eggs seasoned with salt and pepper, 
place over a moderate heat and stir constantly with a wooden spoon taking care that the heat remains even; too quick cooking will 
cause lumps to form which is contrary to the description of the term scrambled. When the eggs have attained the correct smooth,
creamy consistency, remove form the fire, mix in 50 g (2 oz) butter in small pieces and, if ruqeired, 1/2 dl ( 2 fl oz or 1/4 U.S. cup)
cream. A whisk should not be used unless absolutely necessary."<br>

<a name="souffle">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Souffle</b></font><br>
According to the food historians, modern souffles (both sweet and savoury) were a product of
18th century French cuisine. The method is related to that of  <a
href="foodpies.html#lemon">meringue</a>.
<p>

"Souffle<br>
A French word which literally means "puffed up," is a culinary term in both French and English
(and used in many other languages) for a light, frothy dish, just stiff enough to hold its shape, and
which may be savory or sweet, hot or cold. The basic hot souffle has as its starting point a roux--a
cooked mixture of flour and butter...This type of souffle was a French invention of the late 18th
century. Beauvilliers was making souffles possibly as early as 1782 (though he did not publish his
L'Art du cusinier until 1814). Recipes for various kinds appear in Louis Ude's <i>The French
Cook of 1813</i>, a work which promises a "new method of giving good and extremely cheap
fashionable suppers at routs and soirees. Later, in 1841, Careme's <i>Patissier Royal Parisien</i>
goes into great detail on the technique of making souffles, from which it is clear that cooks had
been having much trouble with souffles that collapsed. The dish acquired a reputation for
difficulty and proneness to accidents which it does not really deserve...There are some Ukranian
and Russian dishes of the hot souffle type, independently evolved and slightly different in
composition."<br>
 ---<i>Oxford Compantion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999
(p. 735)
<p>
"Patrons of La Grande Taverne de Londres, which opened in Paris in the 1780s, were perhaps the
first to enjoy this dessert souffle. It comes from the repertoire of Beauvilliers, who, wrote,
Brillat-Savarin, "was for more than fifteen years the most famous restauranteur in Paris"..." <br>
---<i>Horizon Cookbook and Illustrated History of Eating and Drinking Through the Ages</i>,
William Harlan Hale [American Heritage] 1968 (p. 713)
<p>
<b>Why does a souffle fall if there is a loud noise? </b><br>

It doesn't. That nugget of culinary fakelore is not supported by science. The rise and (and the inevitable fall) of every souffle is a direct result of temperature. Heat 
expands the air in the egg whites; coolness deflates it.
<p>
"Though many a cook has blamed the collapse of a souffle on the spouse who slammed the kitchen door, the force of the shock waves from that deed is too weak 
to pop more than a few air bubbles, if any at all. The culpable party, if truth be told, is the cook who made one or more culinary errors in the science of souffle 
making."<br>
---<i>Kitchen Science</i>, Howard Hillman [Houghton Mifflin:Boston] 1989, revised edition (p. 285) 
<p>
"Souffles--savory and sweet mixes lightened with an egg-white foam, then dramatically inflated above their dish by oven heat--have the reputation for being difficult 
preparations...In fact, souffles are reliable and resilient...If you manage to get any air into the mix, an inexorable law of nature will raise it in the oven, and opening 
the door for a few seconds won't do it any harm. The inevitable post-oven deflation can be minimized by your choice of ingredients and cooking method...The physical law that animates the souffle was discovered a few decades after its invention by--appropriately--a French scientist and balloonist,
 J.A.C. Charles. Charles's law is this: all else equal, the volume occupied by a given weight of gas is proportional to its temperature. Heat an inflated balloon and the
 sir will take up more space, so the balloon expands. Similarly, put a souffle in the oven and its air bubbles heat up and swell, so the mix expands in the only 
direction it can: out the top of the dish. Charles's law is part of the story, but not the whole story--it accounts for about a quarter of the typical souffle rise. The rest 
comes from the continuous evaporation of water from the bubble walls into the bubbles. As portions of the souffle approach the boiling point, more liquid water 
becomes water vapor and adds to the quantity of gas molecules in the bubbles, which increases the pressure on the bubble walls, which causes the walls to stretch 
and the bubbles to expand...Charles's law also means that what must go up in the oven must come down at the table...As the souffle bubbles cool, the air they
 contain contracts in volume, and the vapor that come from liquid water in the mix condenses back into liquid...A thick souffle mix can't rise as easily, but it also 
won't fall as easily...Don't worry about opening the oven door. The mix can't fall unless it actually begins to cool down, and even if that did happen, it will rise again
 when it heats up again."<br>

<b>Souffle recipes through time</b><br><blockquote>
<b>[1828]</b>
<b>"Souffles for Entremets.</b><br>
It will be sufficient to observe on the subject of souffles that they are all made in the same manner,
and that they vary only in the taste you give them. If sent up in proper time they are very good
eating, if not, they are no better than other puddings."
<p>
<b>"No. 1. --Souffle of Potatoes with Lemon.</b><br>
Bake a dozen potatoes in the oven; when they are well done, open them, scoop out the most
floury part, and mix it with half a pint of cream that has boiled, and in which you have infused the
peel of a lemon; to this add a little sugar, a large bit of butter, and a little salt; the taste of the
sugar, however, must predominate; yet observe, that the less sugar you use the lighter the souffles
are. Now break six eggs, throw th yolks of four only into the potatoes, breat the six whites, which
pour gently with the above preparation in to a souffle dish, and put it into the oven, which must
not be too hot. When the souffle is done enought, powder a little sugar over it, and use the
salamander; souffles must be served up the moment they are ready, for they are liable to sink."
<p>
<b>"No. 2.--Souffle of Orange Flower.</b><br>
Dilute a little flour with half cream and milk; set this pap on the fire to boil; when the flour is
hoen, put a littel salt, a little sugar, and a small quantitiy of pounded orange flower, mix well, and
then add a good bit of butter, the yolks of six eggs, and mix the whole well. Next beat the six
whites, and mix them with the rest: then bake the souffle as above, and when it is baked enough,
glaze it and send up."
<p>
<b>"No. 4.--Souffle of Bread.</b><br>
Boil some milk with a little cream, to which give any taste you think proper. Threw into it the soft
part of two or three fresh rolls to soak, put the bread through a sieve, and proceed with the eggs,
butter, sugar, &c. as Nos. 1, 2, and 3."
<p>
<b>"No. 6.--Souffle of Chocolate.</b><br>
Take a quarter of a pound of chocoalte, which cut as small as you can, and melt it on the fire in a
little water. When it is entirely melted, throw it into the souffle prepration, NO. 4, the same as all
others...and generally all otehr souffles, are prepared in the same manner. The question is, to
make the preparation well, and above all things to beat the whites of the eggs very well, for on
that alone depends the rising or falling of the souffle."
<p>
"<b>Omelette Souffle."</b><br>
Break six eggs, put the whites into one pan, and the yolks into another; rasp a little lemon peel or
orange flowers, beat the yolks well, add a little sugar and salt, and next beat the whites well <i>en
neige</i>, and mix them with the yolks lightly. Then put a lump of butter into an omelette pan on
the fire; when the butter is melted, our the omelette into the pan; when it is firm enough on one
side to hold the liquid part, turn it over on the dish you send up; then bake it in an oven, or use the
Dutch oven. When it is well raised, glaze it, and sent it up immediately, for it would soon lower.
Mind, it must be convered hermetically with a large fire over it, otherwise it will not rise. To this
you many give whatever flavour you think proper; but the plainer the better, when served very
hot, and very high."<br>

<b>4474. The Moulding and Cooking of Souffles</b><br>
The souffle mixture is placed in a souffle mould or deep silver timbale or in a special

a
moderately hot oven so that the heat may reach the centre of the mixutre by degrees. Two
mintues before removingthe souffle from the oven, dredge the surface wtih icing sugar which will
caramelize and form the required glaze when replaced in the oven. The decoration of souffles is
optional but in any case it should be ketp to a minimum."<br>

These preserved egg delicacies are known in China by many names, most notably: "Thousand year eggs" and "Hundred year
eggs." Do they really take this long to prepare? No. Food historians and contemporary cooks tell us Thousand Year Eggs
are ready anywhere from 45-100 days. The titling numbers hold special good luck significance in Chinese culture.
European and colonial American housewives also knew how to preserve eggs in "slaked lime."
This was the norm before advanced transportation systems and refrigeration technology. Compare with:

"eggs with skin" because of their black outer coating. The English names, although romantic and
exaggerated, describe their antique appearance--they do look as though they've been buried for
centuries.) Preserved eggs usually are eaten uncooked for breakfast or as hors d'oeuvres, and
served frequently at banquets."<br>

"Most interesting of Chinese preserved eggs...are the so-called thousand-year-old eggs (also called hundred-year-old eggs, 
ancient eggs, or Ming Dynasty eggs), a delicacy unusual in appearance, odor, texture, and flavor, and usually bought in the 
market rather than made at home. Despite their name, thousand-year-old eggs are usually cured for just a few months, and are said to
be most tasty at about a hundred days. The eggs of chickens and other birds may be processed into thousand-year-eggs, but duck
eggs are the commmon ones used. This, and the importance of duck eggs in preservation by salting, probably derives from the fact
that they are produced only in localized habitats suited to ducks and need to be shipped to market, yet spoil more quickly than
chicken eggs...Various methods of curing, from simple to elaborate, may be followed in making thousand-year-old-eggs. As detailed
by Kenneth Lo...salt is first dissolved in a small amount of water in a large bowl; then pine ash and lime are slowly added, and the
micture stirred until it reaches a muddy consistency. A thick layer of the mixture is applied to clean duck eggs, which are then rolled in a 
tray of husks, of rice or some other kind, to give them a non-adhesive coat to prevent them from sticking to anything. Then they are 
placed in a big earthenware jar which is covered loosely and left to stand. The eggs are removed everyt three days and rearranged in \
the jar, and after fifteen days the jar is sealed and left for another month. At that time, after 45 days in total, the eggs
should...be ready. A more length procedure...one involving an initial three months of soaking the eggs in a brine made of
water, salt, lime, lye, and tea leaves. Then the eggs are dried, covered with a paste of clay, lime, ashes, and salt, and buried
in the earth for further aging. 
By whatever
process, the end product has a yolk that is green and resembles cheese, and a white that is yellow or amber and of a gelatinous
consistency. In eating a thousand-year-old egg, one must first remove the mud and carefully clean its shell. Then one normally
eats the egg, which has the smell of ammonia, uncooked. It may be eaten with hot rice for breakfast or a late night supper, or 
cut into pieces and served as a snack with soy sauce, sometimes garnished with gingerroot strips or slices, or with a sauce made
of vinegar and shredded ginger...Such eggs may also be prepared in other ways, as in 'Fried 100-Year-Old-Eggs'...or 'Old and Fresh
Eggs,' a steamed dish that includes both thousand year-old egg yolks and fresh eggs...The ultimate in combining types of eggs...is
'Steamed Three Variety Eggs,' which includes in a single dish thousand-year-old eggs, salted eggs, and fresh ones."<br>---

<a name="clarification">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Clarifying agents: egg whites & eggshells</b></font><br>

  We find references to clarifying soup (broth, consomme) and <a href="foodeggs.html#coffeeshells">coffee</a> with egg whites and egg shells in 19th century American
  cookbooks authored by home/domestic economists. These texts explain the scientific/chemical reasons for using egg whites. They do not, however,
  address the issue of the egg shell. 
<p>
<b>What is clarification?</b>
<p>
  "Clarification is the process of clearing a liquid of suspended particles...In the kitchen,
  things which may need clarification are stock, clear soup, aspic, jelly, etc. The agents of
  clarification are various. Filtration is simplest but will not catch the smallest particles. A
  change in temperature may suffice, if followed by drawing off the liquid from above or
  from below. Or  hunter-catchers' may be let loose in pursuit of the particles, as when egg
  white and eggshell are employed or a few slices of potato are heated in used cooking oil.
  Even more drastic are the  hunter-killers', in the shape of proteolytic or pectolytic
  enzymes which do not merely trap the offending material but destroy it."<br>

To Clarify Stock.</b><br>
109. INGREDIENTS.— The whites of 2 eggs, 1/2 pint of water, 2 quarts of stock.
Mode .— Supposing that by some accident the soup is not quite clear, and that its quantity is 2 quarts, take the whites of 2 eggs, carefully separated from their yolks, whisk them well together with the water, and add gradually the 2 quarts of boiling stock, still whisking. Place the soup on the fire, and when boiling and well skimmed, whisk the eggs with it till nearly boiling again; then draw it from the fire, and let it settle, until the whites of the eggs become separated. Pass through a fine cloth, and the soup should be clear.
Note .— The rule is, that all clear soups should be of a light straw colour, and should not savour too strongly of the meat; and that all white or brown thick soups 
should have no more consistency than will enable them to adhere slightly to the spoon when hot. All purées should be somewhat thicker."<br>

  Remove fat from stock, and put quantity to be cleared in stew-pan, allowing white and
  shell of one egg to each quart of stock. Beat egg slightly, break shell in small pieces and
  add to stock. Place on front of range, and stir constantly until boiling point is reached;

Yes! Primary sources confirm this was a common practice from early 19th century to pre-WWII USA. Why? The eggshells were employed
as <a href="foodeggs.html#clarification">clarifying agents</a>, a practice also used for consomme. NOTE: the shells were strained from the brew before serving.

and an egg in the middle of a piece of cheesecloth and tie the cheesecloth into a sack. Then break the egg in the sack and mix with the coffee by massaging the

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Early American egg preservation techniques</b></font><br>
Like <a href="foodeggs.html#thousand">Thousand Year Eggs</a>, their venerable Chinese counterparts, colonial Americans preserved fresh 
eggs in lime. Why bother preserving eggs in a time when many people owned chickens? Before industrial farming, chickens 
 didn't lay as many eggs during the cold, dark winter months. Pioneer families traveling west welcomed precious eggs in their
meals. Live chickens were sometimes transported but did not last long on the trail.
<p>
<b>A survey of historic American preservation instructions:</b>
<blockquote>
<b>"Eggs will keep almost any length of time in lime-water properly prepared</b>. One pint of coarse
salt, and one pint of unslacked lime, to a pailful of water. If there be too much lime, it will eat the
shells from the eggs; and if there be a single egg cracked, it will spoil the whole. They should be
covered with lime-water, and kept in a cold place. The yolk becomes slightly red; but I have seen
eggs, thus kept, perfectly sweet and fresh at the end of three years. The cheapest time to lay down
eggs, is early in spring, and the middle and last of September. It is bad economy to buy eggs by
the dozen, as you want them."<br>
---<i>American Frugal Housewife</i>, Mrs. Child, Boston [1833] (p.11)
<p>
<b>"To choose eggs</b><br>
There are many rules for trying the soundness and freshness of eggs, one of which is to put them
in a pan of fresh water; all that will sink readily to the bottom of the pan are good, and all that
rise
or float on the top, are certainly rotten. It is said that in proportion to the freshness of the egg its
progress to the bottom of the pan will be. There is another very good rule, though a singular one,
that is, having washed and wiped the eggs clean, touch the large end with your tongue, and if, by
holding it there a second or two, it feels warm to your tongue, it is good, but if it feels cold, it is a
certain sign it is not good.
<p>
<b>To keep eggs</b><br>
Eggs will keep for some time, buried in charcoal or wheat bran, after greasing them a little with
mutton tallow; but I believe the general opinion of those who have tried it is, that to keep them in
lime-water is the best way they can be preserved. To half a bushel of water add little over a pint
of
unslaked lime, and a as much coarse salt, and when the whole is dissolved, put in the eggs; be
very particular that you do not put in one that is cracked, as it will spoil the whole; there would
be
plenty of water to cover them well; if the brine is too strong with lime, it will eat the shells; this
of
course can be easily detected; if the eggs are fresh and whole, and water of the proper strength, it
is said they will keep good for years." <br>
---<i>Kentucky Housewife</i>, Lettice Bryan, Cincinnati [1839] (p. 224-5)
<p>
<b>"To keep eggs til 17th of June, or for Christmas</b><br>
Buy eggs for family use when cheapest; put them into two gallons of water, mixed with half a
pint
of salt and half a pint of unslacked lime. Make the pickle with boiling water. Put it cold to the
eggs. Let the eggs be new laid, and perfect; quite covered with the lime water, and kept in a stone
pot in a cool place. Thus preserved, eggs will keep good six months. If occasionally turned over,
the better."<br>
---<i>Improved Housewife</i>, A Married Lady [Mrs. A. L. Webster], Hartford [1844] (p. 204)
<p>
<b>"To preserve eggs</b><br>
Take a keg or pail, cover the bottom with half an inch of salt, and set your eggs close together, on
the small end; sprinkle them over with salt so as to cover them entirely, and then put down
another layer of eggs, and cover with salt, till your keg is full; cover it tight, and put it where they
will not freeze, and they will keep fresh and good a year, or longer. The eggs must be new and
fresh when put down. If you take eggs as soon as the hen has laid them, and smear the shells with
lard or butter, they will keep as good as new-laid eggs for some time; but if you rub the shells
with butter at any time, it will keep them good for months, and will prevent their being hatched."<br>
---<i>New England Economical Housekeeper</i>, Mrs. E. A. Howland, Montpelier [1845] (p. 68)
<p>
<b>"To choose eggs</b><br>
Fresh eggs when held to the light, the white will look clear, and the yolk distinct; if not good they
will have a clouded appearance. When eggs are stale, the white will be thin and watery, and the
yolk will not be a uniform color, when broken; if there is no mustiness, or disagreeable smell,
eggs
in this state, are not unfit for making cakes, puddings, etc. Eggs for boiling should be as fresh as
possible; a new laid egg will generally recommend itself, by the delicate transparency of its shell.
Eggs may be kept fresh for several weeks, by packing them, the small end downwards, in bran or
chaff; keep them in a cool place. A refrigerator, or ice-box, will keep eggs as when first laid for a
long time.
<p>
<b>To keep eggs</b><br>
Take fresh laid eggs, dip each one in melted lard, or beef fat, or rub a bit of butter thoroughly
over the shell, between the hands; then pack them, the small end downwards, in bran or chaff; in
this way they will keep good for months. Eggs may be kept good for a year, in the following
manner:-To a pail of water, put of unslacked lime and coarse salt each a pint; keep it in a cellar,
or
cool place, and put the eggs in, as fresh laid as possible. It is well to keep a stone pot of the lime
water ready to receive the eggs as soon as laid make a fresh supply every few months. This lime
water is of exactly the proper strength; strong lime water will cook the eggs. Very strong lime
water will eat the shell."<br>
---<i>Mrs. Crowen's American Lady's Cookery Book</i>, Mrs. T. J. Crowen, New York [1847] (p.
164-5)
<p>
<b>"To keep eggs</b><br>
...There are various ways of preserving eggs. To keep them merely for plain boiling, you may
parboil them for one minute, and then bury them in powdered charcoal with their small ends
downward. They will keep a few days in a jar of salt; but do not afterwards use the salt in which
they have been immersed. They are frequently preserved for two or three months by greasing
them all over, when quite fresh, with melted mutton suet, and then wedging them close together
(the small end downwards) in a box of bran, layer above layer; the box must be closely covered.
Another way (and a very good one) is to put some lime in a large vessel, and slack it with boiling
water, till it is of the consistence of thin cream; you may allow a gallon of water to a pound of
lime. When it is cold, pour it off into a large stone jar, put in the eggs, and cover the jar closely.
See that the eggs are always well covered with the lime-water, and lest they should break, avoid
moving the jar. If you have hens of your own keep a jar of lime-water always ready, and put in
the
eggs as they are brought in from the nests. Jars that hold about six quarts are the most
convenient.
It will be well to renew the lime-water occasionally."<br>
---<i>Directions for Cookery in Its Various Branches</i>, Miss [Eliza] Leslie, Philadelphia [1849] (p.
206-7)
<p>
<b>"Keep eggs in a cool, not cold place.</b> Pack in bran or salt, with the small end downward, if you
wish to use within two or three weeks; and furthermore, take the precaution to grease them well
with linseed oil, or wash them over with a weak solution of gum tragacanth or varnish. This
excludes the air. Another way is to make some pretty strong lime-water, allowing a pound of
lime
to a gallon of boiling water. When perfectly cold, fill a large jar with it in which you have packed
the eggs, small end downward; lay a light saucer upon the top to keep them under water, and
keep in a cool place. Renew the lime-water every three weeks. You may add an ounce of
saltpetre
to it. Eggs for boiling may be "canned' as follows; So soon as they are brought in from the nests,
put two or three dozen at a time in a deep pan; pour scalding water over them; let it stand thirty
seconds, and turn it all off. Cover immediately with more scalding water, and repeat the process
yet the third time. Wipe dry, and pack in bran or salt when they cool. This hardens the albumen
into an air-tight case for the yolk. Of course, you cannot use these eggs for cake or syllabubs, or
anything that is prepared with whipped eggs. Pack with the small end down."<br>
---<i>Common Sense in the Household: A Manual of Practical Housewifery</i>, Marion Harland, New
York [1882] (p. 240-1)
<p>
<b>"Putting eggs down</b><br>
In order to insure eggs at a reasonable price the season through it is advisable to  'put them down'
while they are plentiful. "Grandmother" used to bury eggs in salt or sand, but this is a bulky and
unsatisfactory method. The modern way, heartily endorsed by the government and all food
experts, is to put them down in water glass--a method which is simple, absolutely harmless,
inexpensive, and eminently satisfactory. It may be argued that the saving in price is not worth
while, but if it means only twenty cents a dozen, it will soon amount to dollars. Water glass may
be purchased at any drugstore at a very reasonable cost. But do not allow its chemical name to be
disturbing--it is merely potassium and sodium silicate. It should be bought commercially, not in
the form of the chemical pure article, as the latter is expensive, and the commercial variety is just
as effective. The equipment for putting down the eggs is very simple , all that is necessary being
good-sized, well-washed utensils of earthenware, glass, or enamelware, a utensil for measuring,
water, water glass, and eggs. The eggs must be clean but should not be washed as this removes
some of the natural coating. Pour one measure of water glass into the utensil, add ten times as
much water, mix well, and they put in the eggs, two or three at a time, taking care not to break
them. More may be added to the solution from day to day as they accumulate. If possible, the
eggs should be fresh laid. To prevent evaporation and chemical action because of the air, the
utensil should be kept covered. In the case of glass jars, the tops are adequate, without any
special
sealing with paraffine or other substances. In case of stone crocks, a piece of cheesecloth, folded
two or three times and put over the top of the jar, extending out under the lid, will be sufficient.
The eggs should be kept in a cool place but should not be allowed to freeze. Eggs put up in this
manner may be used in all the familiar ways. If to be boiled, however, the ends should be pricked
with a needle or pin; otherwise the egg is liable to burst, as the pores of the shell have been so
well sealed by the water glass."<br>
