<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Bread, beer & yeast</b></font><br>
The history of bread and cake starts with Neolithic cooks and marches through time according to
ingredient availability, advances in technology, economic conditions, socio-cultural influences,
legal rights (Medieval guilds), and evolving taste. The earliest breads were <a
href="foodbreads.html#pitta">unleavened</a>. Variations in grain, thickness, shape, and texture varied from
culture to culture.
<p>
Archaelogical evidence confirms <a href="foodbreads.html#yeasthistory">yeast</a> (both as leavening agent and
for brewing ale) was used in
Egypt as early as 4000 B.C. Food historians generally cite this date for the discovery of leavened
bread and genesis of the brewing industry. There is an alternate theory regarding the invention of
brewing.  Some historians believe it is possible that brewing began when the first cereal crops
were domesticated. Sources generally agree the discovery of the powers of yeast was accidental. 
<p>
"No one has yet managed to date the origins of beer with any precision, and it is probably an
impossible task. Indeed, there are scholars who have theorized that a taste for ale prompted the
beginning of agriculture, in which case humans have been brewing for some 10,000 years...Most
archaeological evidence, however, suggests that fermentation was being used in one manner or
another by around 4000 to 3500 B.C. Some of this evidence-from an ancient Mesopotamian
trading outpost called Godin Tepe in present-day Iran- indicates that barley was being fermented
at that location around 3500 B.C. Additional evidence recoverd at Hacinegi Tepe (a similar site in
southern Turkey) also suggest that ancient Mesopotamians were fermenting barley at a very early
date...There is no question that fermentation takes place accidentally (as it must have done
countless times before humans learned something about controlling the process), and most
investigators believe that barley was first cultivated in the Fertile Crescent region of lower
Mesopotamia between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Grain is heavy to transport relative to
the beer made from it, so it is not surprising that there may be evidence of ale in these outposts
and not unreasonable to suspect that accidental fermentation did occur at some point in the
ancient Mesopotamian region, leading to beer making."<br>
---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kenneth F. Kiple and Kriemhild Conee Ornelas,
Volume 1 [Cambridge University Press:Cambridge] 2000 (p. 619-620)
<p>
"It seems that the discovery of ale was stimulated by the process of bread-making. At some stage
in the Neolithic era people had learned that if, instead of using ordinary grain, they used grain that
had been sprouted and then dried, it made a bread that kept unusually well. Something very like
this was used in brewing. The Egyptian process was to sprout the grain, dry it , crush it, mix it to
a dough and partially bake it. The loaves were then broken up and put to soak in water, where
they were allowed to ferment for about a day before the liquor was strained off and considered
ready for drinking."<br>
---<i>Food in History</i>, Reay Tannahill [Three Rivers Press:New York] 1988 (p.48)
<p>
"Leavening, according to one theory, was discovered when some yeast spores--the air is full of
them, especially in a bakehouse that is also a brewery--drifted onto a dough that had been set
aside for a while before baking; the dough would rise, not very much, perhaps, but enough to
make the bread lighter and more appetizing than usual, and afterwards, as so often in the ancient
world, inquiring minds set about the
task of reproducing deliberately a process that had been discovered by accident. 
     But there is an alternative and even more likely theory-that on some occasion ale instead of
water was used to mix the dough. The rise would be more spectacular than from a few errant
spores and the effect would be easy to explain and equally easy to reproduce."<br>
---<i>Food in History</i>, Tannahill (p. 51-52)
<p>
"The brewing of beer may well have occurred soon after the production of cereal crops, and no
doubt for a long time beer was home-produced and in the hands of housewives responsible for
preparing the  gruel or bread...the first production of beer may be reasonably considered as an
accidental discovery resulting for the malting of grain for other purposes."<br>

<b>Ancient ovens & baking</b><br>

"The most important part of the baker's equipment is, and always has been, his oven. For six thousand years and more it is the oven, however crude or complex,
which has transformed the sticky wet dough into bread. It is the oven which influences the final character of the loaf; the effieciencycy of an oven, or lack of it, can
determine the success or failure of any bread baker's business. It is the heart of the baking process...It was the Egyptians who first used a manufactured portable oven. This
was a beehive- or barrel-shaped container of baked clay, usually divided into two by a central horizontal partition. The lower section formed the fire-box in which were
burned pieces of dried wood, foten taken from the Nile, or even dried animal dung. The upper part, accessible from the top, was the baking chamber. An oven of
similar shape, but often constructed of hollowed stone instead of clay, was used by the early Jews. Instead of placing the dough pieces for baking on the bottom 
or sole of the baking chamber, the Jews put the pieces on the sides. Being damp and sticky they remained in place intil they had dried out, when they fell to the
bottom of the oven. The Jews also had fixed ovens in some of their houses, frequently in the main rooms. These ovens or hearths took the form of clay-covered hollows in 
the floor which were heated with burning wood. When the heat was sufficient the embers were raked out and the pieces of dough placed in the hollows and covered over. 
In Jerusalem there was a bakers' quarter where bread was baked in tiers of stone-built ovens, or furnaces as they were called in the Bible. 
     In Ancient Rome bread ovens in the public bakeries were originally hewn from solid rock. These ovens were heated by the familiar method of burning wood in the
baking chamber, raking out the ashes and putting in the dough to bake. The oven opening was closed with a large stone, sometimes sealed with clay. Ovens which
worked on this principle, but were constructed of bricks or small stones, may still be seen in the ruined city of Pompeii. The fact ovens based on this simple design
formed the majority of those in use throughout Europe until little more than two centuries ago. Although some of the early Roman ovens had chimnesy to improve
the draught and carry away steam, it was many centuries before chimneys were commonly used or dampers incorporated so that the heat could be more
effectively controlled."<br>
---<i>The Story of Bread</i>, Ronald Sheppard & Edward Newton [Charles T. Branford:Boston MA] 1957 (p. 107-109)
<p>
""When I break your staff ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and shall deliver your bread again by weight; and you shall eat, and not be satsified."
---Lev. 26:26. This type of oven may have been a small earthenware cylindar called tannur in the Bible as it is by present-day rural north Africans who still use it. A fire is
kindled in the bottom and the dough is slapped against the hot interior walls, yielding curved disks  of bread. Many other sorts of oven have been discovered in 
Israeli excavations. Larger, bi-level ovens have been unearthed which would have been more suitable for baking commercial quantities. They have a top rack
to hold the loaves, while the fire below is stoked with "the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven..."
(Mt. 6:30). These baking techniques and others were known to the Romans, whose own commercial bakeries were not established unitl a relatively late date
(171-168 B.C.). Once Roman administrative genius was applied to even so commonplace a task as breadmaking, the results 
would be impressive."<br>

<p>
<b> About ancient Roman ovens</b><br>
"Many kitchens had an oven, furnus, sometimes called a fornax...The oven consisted of a square or dome-shaped hollow construction of brick or stone, with a flat
 floor, often made of granite, sometimes lava. It was filled with dry twigs when lit. When the flire was spent, the glowing embers were swept aside. The first heat of
 the glowing oven was suitable for baking unleavened or thin breads. Pizzas are still cooked this way, and this type of oven is  still considered best for baking 
top-quality bread. Thin breads go in first, then large round loaves to in, or meat dishes, and the door is closed. After an hour or so,  these are removed, but the 
oven is still hot, so finer pastries follow, then dishes that require the least heat, such as meringues."<br>

<b>What is a "Baker's Dozen?"</b><br>
A "Bakers Dozen" is 13 items (cookies, muffins, bread, etc.). The practice stems from Medieval times when bread was sold 
by the loaf. Because some loaves were lighter than others (purposeful shortweighting or ingredient differential) laws
were enacted requiring bread be sold by weight. Adding an extra baked good to the customer's standard
dozen ensured customers they were getting their money's worth. This practice remains active today in many bakeries
across America.

 <p>
 "Baker's dozen. There are many theories about the origin of this phrase. The most
 commonly accepted theory dates back to fifteenth-century  England. It seems that bakers
 had long had a reputation--whether deserved or not--for short-weighting their bread. As
 a result, very strict laws were passed, regulating the weight of various kinds of breads,
 muffins and cakes. But, as every cook knows, it's not possible--especially when cooking
 with the primitive ovens then available--to have the loaves absolutely uniform in
 weight. So the practice developed of giving thirteen loaves on every order for twelve,
 thereby guaranteeing that there would be no penalty for shortages.
    Another theory is that the phrase developed by analogy from  printer's dozen, for in
 the early days of publishing it was the custom of printers to supply the retailer with
 thirteen copies of a book on each order of twelve. Since the retailer was billed at list
 price, the return on the thirteenth book represented his profit on the transaction. As a
 sidelight on this medieval selling technique, by the way, we may note that one of the
 most prevalent practices of the book trade is for the publisher to offer retailers "one-for-ten" or one free book with 
every ten ordered, thereby increasing the retailer's margin of
 profit and, of course, the number of books sold by the publisher. 
      The there's still another theory. It seems that the bakers of the medieval period had
 such a bad name that the words baker and devil were sometimes used interchangeably.
 Thus, the term baker's dozen may have evolved from devil's dozen, which was a
 common folk phrase meaning thirteen. And thirteen was the number of witches usually
 reprsent at meetings summoned by Old Nick."<br>

 Row:New York] 1962, Volume 1 (p. 23)

<a name="breadbox">
<b>Why were bread boxes invented?</b><br>
Bread boxes certainly would have discouraged mice, but that was not the reason they were invented.
Homeade bread (without chemical preservatives) has a very short shelf life. In the olden days, much
bread was consumed the day it was made. Leftover bread quickly staled unless stored in a protective
environment that could control air flow and moisture. Before the advent of cheap metal products, bread
was stored in crocks. These containers could not be completely airtight (hence the holes in the metal
bread box) or bread's own natural moisture would do it in. 
<p>
"Among the vital points to remember about the storage of bread are, first, the larger the loaf the longer
it stays fresh; next, that a loaf should never be wrapped up or put away until it is perfectly cool; and
that unless it is be to be consigned to a deep freeze it keeps best if it is allowed to breathe. A loaf
enclosed in...a sealed plythene box or bag may appear to retain its moisture for a day or two but is in
fact giving it out; this moisture is condensing in the airtight container and dampening although not
quite so quickly, when bread is stored in a non-porous, highly glazed stoneware crock unless there is an
air hole in the cover, or unless the cover can be raised slightly, allowing air into the crock...On street-maket
 stalls and in antique shops one sometimes coms across the old Doulton stoneware storage crock
for bread. It is a rare occurrence to find one complete with its cover. This is because the people who
made these crocks, familiar with the problems of bread storage, evolved specially designed lightweight
steel covers, slightly domes and perforated with small air holes in the centre. These covers provided a
very practical solution to the problems both of ventilation and of weight..."<br>

<a name="breadpans">
<b>When did we start baking square-shaped bread in pans?</b><br>
Food historian Elizabeth David sums this topic up most eloquently:<br>
"Bread baked in pans or tins of uniform shape and capacity was a late development. Indeed, it
seems to
have been mainly a British one, Holland being the only other European country in which the
method is in
general use. In France only soft sandwich loaves and rusk bread are baked in tins, provided with a
sliding
cover so that almost crustless tops and perfectly even shapes are achieved ..Before the advent of
mass-produced tinware English household bread was either baked in earthenware crocks glazed
on the inside
only, or the loaves were hand-moulded and fed into the oven on wooden peels in the ancient
manner, as
was our bakery bread. In the seventeenth century, deep tin or wooden hoops and, more rarely,
round iron
cake pans were used for yeast cakes, and there were earthenware dishes for pies,  'broad tins' for
gingerbread, tin patty pans, plates and oven sheets for small cakes, biscuits and
confectionery...and
occasionally wooden dishes for moulding rolls or small loaves--Robert May [English cookbook
author:
<i>The Accomplist Cook</i>, [1660] specifies these--but until the turn of the eighteenth century
no mention is
made in cookery books of tins for bread-baking. That they were in used long before that, probably
in the
early years of the century, seems certain, but it is Mrs. Rundell, writing in the second editon of <i>A
New
System of Domestic Cookery</i> (1807), who makes the earliest English cookery book reference I
have yet
found to tin loaves:  'If baked in tins the crust will be very nice', says Mrs. Rundell.
      It is curious to reflect that without those tins we might never have had the sliced wrapped
loaf. Dear Mrs
Rundell, would she have been quite so pleased with the innovation had she forseen where it was
to lead?
And how was it that only the Dutch and the English took readily to bread baked in tins while the
system was
obviously rejected by the rest of Europe? Of course, at the time it must have seemed wonderfully
convenient--it still does--to settle a batch of dough comfortably into space-saving tins, simply
cover them
with a cloth and transfer them into the heated oven when the dough had risen for the second time.
This
means much less handling in the shaping of the dough; the tricky notching, cutting or  'scotching',
as the
earlier writers called this part of dough management, could be dispensed with; and if the dough
had been
made up too slack no harm will be done; it would be confined within the walls of the tin and so
could not
spread and flatten out, but would spring upwards.
     By the early nineteeth century domestic cooking methods had aleady much changed. In the
towns coal
ranges with ovens were being installed in kitchens, so the separate bakehouse with its special
bread oven
was often abolished, and housewives or their cooks no doubt found that in the new ovens bread
baked in
tins or crocks was more satisfactory than the old hand-moulded  'crusty' loaves, the all-round
exposure to
high heat in a small space without radiation from above causing a hard crust to develop before the
inner
part of the loaf had properly grown...In stpite of the new tins and the new ovens, which certainly
didn't
become common until after the middle of the nineteenth century, most householders continued to
make
their bread as they had always done, often taking the prepared dough to a communal oven or to a
local
bakery to be baked. When Eliza Acton [English Cookbook author: <i>Modern Cookery fo
Private
Families</i>, 1845] did this at Tonbridge she put her dough into large round earthen crocks,
rather shallow,
wide at the top and with sloping sides. The tin loaf was given short shrift by Miss Acton.  'The
loaves are
technically called bricks, which are baked in tins,' she remarks,  are of convenient form for making
toast of
for slicing bread and butter.' "<br>

<b>About yeast</b><br>
"Yeast has been used in the preparation of food and drink for as long as there have been leavened
bread and beer, but it was only in the 19th century, thanks to the work of Pasteur, that its nature
was understood...Yeast is a single-celled fungus, of which hundreds of species have been
identified. Those of the genera Saccharomyces and Candida are the most useful. The single cells
are very small: hundreds of millions to a teaspoonful. Instead of feeding by photosynthesis, as
green plants do, they feed on carbohydrates...and excrete alcohol. They breathe air and exhale
carbon dioxide...Despite the simplicity of their structure, yeast cells can operate in alternative
ways; one that suits bread-making and one that is right for brewers. Given plenty of air and some
food, yeast grows fast and produces a lot of carbon dioxide. It is the pressure of this gas which
makes the bread rise. Only a little alcohol is formed. However, in a fermentation vat, where there
is almost no air but an abundance of food in the form of sugar, the yeast cells change to a different
mode, breathing little and concentrating on turning sugar into alcohol. The same species of yeast,
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, constitutes both baker's and brewer's yeast...Beer leaven, known as
 barm, was used for bread-making until quite recent times. The making of beer, black bread, and
the alcoholic drink kvass were traditionally linked in Russia...it is no longer true that the same
yeast is used for brewing and baking...In addition of fermenting and flavoring other foods, yeasts
themselves may also be used as food. They contain much protein and all but one of the B vitamins
(B12)...They are consequently used to provide dietary supplements for countries whos diets are
deficient in protein."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
855, 857)<br>
[NOTE: according to this source, yeast is also used to make kefir, koumiss, soy sauce, sake, and
the fermentation of cocoa to develop the flavor of chocolate.]
<p>
"It is estimated that the art of making wine, leavened bread and beer was practiced more than 4000 years ago. Phenomena producing these foods were attributed to
 yeast. And, in many languages, the word for yeast describes the visible effects of fermentation, as observedin the expansion of bread dough and the accumulation of
 froth or barm on the surface of fermenting juices and mashes. Historically, it has been reported that yeast cells were first seen in a droplet of beer mounted on a 
crude microscope by van Leeuwhenhoek in 1680. He found globular bodies, but was not aware that these were living forms. For nearly 2 centuries the theory of 
spantaneous generation dominated through and research on the causes of fermentation and disease. In 1818, Erxleben described beer yeast as living vegetable matter
 responsible for fermentation. In the following 20 years, yeasts were sown to reproduce by budding and, in 1837, Meyen named yeast, Saccharomyces or 'sugar
 fungus.' By 1839, Schwann observed 'endospores' in yeast cells, later named ascospores by Reess. As early as 1857, Pasteur proved the biological nature of
 fermentation and later, n 1876, Pasteur demonstrated that yeast can shift its metabolism from a fermentive to an oxidative pathway when subjected to aeration. 
This shift, then named the Pasteur effect, is especially characteristic of bakers' yeast...and is applied in large-scale production of yeasts. Botanically, yeasts form a heterogeous
group of saprophytic forms of life occuring natrually on the surface of fruits, in honey, exudates of trees, and soil. They are disseminated by airborne dust, insects,
and animals."<br>
---<i>Foods and Food Production Encyclopedia</i>, Douglas M. Considine [Van Nostrand Reinhold:New York] 1982 (p. 2163)

<p>
"Commercially produced yeast first appeared in the United States in the 1860s. Charles and Maximillian Fleischmann, immigrants from
Austria-Hungary, with the financial backing of James Gaff, patented and sold standardized cakes of compressed yeast...produced
in their factory in Cincinati. By the early twentieth century, factory-produced yeast was widely available. Cookbook recipes
began specifying that commercial yeast be added directly to bread dough in sufficient quantities to leaven it in less than
two hours. Bread changed in texture, becoming lighter and softer, and its flavor turned blander..."<br>

"The dietary qualities of bread depended on four variables (so Simeon Seth carefully explains): the kind of grain, the making of the dough, the form of oven and the
 baking process. He later adds a fifth, the length of time between baking and eating: different qualities are allowed to bread which is still warm, to today's bread 
which is cold, and to bread one or two days old: after that, it is not good to eat. One can tell the superior power of wheat, Simeone Seth continues, from the fact
 that the raw grain can scarcely be broken by the teeth. By contrast with bread made from fine wheat, emmer bread (artos olyrites) was a makeshift when there was
 no other bread to be found...Again , it was possible to make bread from oats. But oats were 'food for cattle, not people, except when extreme famine dictates that 
bread be baked from them...' One almost poetic evocation of good bread is due to the enthusiastic compiler of the dietary text De Cibis...He calls for white bread
 'with a moderate use of yeast and salt, the dough kneaded midway between dryness and rawness', but that is only the beginning. There should be 'a little anise, 
fennel seed and mastic', additions still favoured by many Aegean bread-makers...Bread was the staple food of Byzantium. That evaluation is strongly suggested by
 the fact that grain comes first in 'Categories of Foods'...and wheat comes first among grains. Bread likewise comes first in Simeon Seth's On the Properties of 
Foods.."<br>---<i>Tastes of Byzantium: The Cuisine of a Legendary Empire</i>, Andrew Dalby [I.B. Tauris:New York] 2003, 2010 (p. 77-79) 
<p>
"...bakers of Constantinople are the subject of quite special regulations in the Book of the Eparch compiled under Leo VI. The municipal regulations specify with
 great precision the price to be charged for bread, and also exempt the human and animal staff of bakeries from being commandeered for public service. 'Bakers 
shall sell bread by weight fixed from time to time according to the price of wheat, as ordered by the Eparch. They are to buy wheat in the Assistant's warehouse, in 
units corresponding to the amount on which a tax of one gold nomisma is payable. After grinding, proing and baking, they shall calculate the price by adding one
 deration and two miliaqresia per gold nomisma; the keration being their profit, and the two miliaresia the cost of employing the men and the animals who do the
 milling, and also the cost of fires and lighting. Bakers are never liable to be called for any public service, either themselves nor their animals, to prevent any
 interruption of the baking of bread. They must not have their ovens under any dwelling house...'"<br>---<i>Tastes of Byzantium</i> (p. 64) 
<p>
"There were two useful substitutes for freshly-baked bread, for those who were out of reach of this prized commodity. They were the ring-shaped loaf boukellaton
 and the thickly sliced toasted barley bread paximadi. Both were typical food for the Byzantine army."<br>---<i>Tastes of Byzantium</i> (p. 99) 
<p>
"White bread. Bread made from wheat is the best and most nutritious of all foods. Particularly if white, with a moderate use of yeast and salt, the dough kneaded 
midway between dryness and rawness, and with the little anise, fennel seed and mastic, it is very fine indeed. One with a hot constitution should include sesame in 
the dough. If wishing to add more moistness to the bread, knead in some almond oil."<br>---<i>Tastes of Byzantium</i> (p. 180) 
<p>
<b>Bread types & recies</b><br>
"Bread was the primary product of cereals, at least for the affluent. Recipes appear to be in two general categories: leavened wheat bread and unleavened bread, 
often mixed with another grain. Breads are very frequently mentioned, but except for a few passages, we have only hits of the ingredients and cooking processes. I
 have found no statement that leavened bread was allowed to rise twice as it is currently, but I don't know if that is because only one rising was allowed or it was
 simply a well-known fact so that no one needed to mention it. Leavening is also seldom clearly specified. It could be the ale or beer barm (yeast), the wild yeast, 
floating in the air, sourdough yeast, or the yeast contained in the dough from a previous batch if bread (which was left uncooked, but dried). Consequently, any of
 the recipes below should be treated as speculative...the 'wheaten bread should be prepared from the least glutinous wheat flour possible, and this gently fermented 
with sweet leaven, such as is made form the hardest spelt flour...Bake in an oven seems to be to be safer than in a covered earthenware vessel, but better still is 
baking in a milk bread oven: for the baking is gentle and takes a long time and burning from the fire does not readily happen to the bread in the baking because the
 heat is outside the oven.'...Oribasios appears to be describing a wheat bread made with something like (low gluten) cake flour and a starter made from spelt. This
 dough is then placed in an oven where the heat source is outside the baking chamber. Ground spelt will ferment if mixed with water, but the process has some risks
 and many days before it can be used. I recommend the use of dry yeast for safety and convenience, but if you'd like to take the medieval approach, here goes"<br>---
<i>Byzantine Cuisine</i>, Henry Marks [Henry Marks:Eugene OR] 2002 (p. 138) 
<p>
<b>Modernized recipes</b><blockquote>
<b>Starter</b> 1/4 C(up) stone ground spelt, 3/4 cup water,1 t(easpoon) sugar or honey <br>
<b>Bread Starter:</b> 3 C(ups) cake flour or other low gluten wheat flour, 1 T(ablespoon) salt, 3/4 C(up) water <br>
Mix spelt, water and sugar/honey. Cover lightly and place in a warm place (75-85 degrees F). In 18 to 48 hours, the spelt mixture should have fermented and become somewhat bubbly. A pink tinge means it has turned bad and you should discard and start again. There will be a slight sour smell, but if the smell is more than slightly sour, it has probably spoiled and you'll need to start again. I urge caution in the use of these starters as they can produce some annoying medical problems. 
When the spelt mixture is actively bubbling, add the cake flour (slightly more or less than the 3 cups may be required), water and salt. Mix completely. Allow to rest
 for a few minutes and then knead. Knead for at least 15 minutes. Place in a greased bowl and cover. When the dough no longer bounces back from a finger
 pushed into it, form it into a round shape (or multiple round shapes) and place on a baking tray sprinkled with stone ground wheat. Place this into a 350 degree F. 
oven and cook for approximately 1 hour (time depends on the size of the loaves you've made). To check for doneness, remove from baking sheet and tap on 
bottom. Bread should sound hollow. The resulting loaf is substantially less well-risen than if high gluten flour, modern yeast, or two or more rising are used. If you 
wish to make the bread lighter, you may start with a cold oven and allow the bread to rise more as the oven warms. Baking time will be increased slightly. 
<p>
"If you wish to get the taste of spelt in your bread, but don't want to go to the trouble of making the starter, you can use spelt flour plus commercial yeast. This will 
produce a fairly similar tasting but better risen bread. <br>
1 C(up) water, 1 T(ablespoon) honey, 1/2 C(up) whole spelt flour, 2+ C(up) cake (or other low-gluten) flour, 1 t(easpoon) salt, oil, 1 t(easpoon) packaged yeast. 
Combine yeast with warmed water and honey. Allow the yeast to grow in the spelt for at least 30 minutes, then add flour until you have formed a soft dough. Knead
 for at least 15 minutes. Place in a greased bowl and cover. When the dough no longer bounces back from a finger pushed into it, form it into a round shape (or 
multiple round shapes) and place on a baking tray sprinkled with stone ground wheat. Place this into a 375 degree F. oven and cook for approximately 30 minutes 
(for two small loaves). To check for doneness, remove from baking sheet and tap on bottom. Bread should sound hollow. This bread is better risen than the 
preceding loaf, but is still far form a modern, well-risen loaf of bread. 
<p>
"'Koukoule says, 'Brucellatum was the Latin for crusted wheat and it was used to make unleavened bread for the soldiers...The bread which is given to the troops 
to eat, required that it be dunked into liquid to soften it enough to be chewed.' <br>
4 C(ups) crushed wheat, 1 C(up) water. Add the crushed wheat to one cup of warm water. it may take slightly more or less than the 4 cups of crushed wheat. 
When the dough has formed and holds together, knead if for 15 to 20 minutes. More crushed wheat my be needed in the kneading process. Heavily grease and
 flour a pan. Put the dough in the pan in a 350 degrees F. oven for 45 minutes. Remove from oven and cool until the 'bread' can be removed from the pan. Cut into 
1/2 inch slices 3 to 4 inches long. Place these pieces on a baking sheet in one layer. Increase oven temperature to 375 degrees F. and continue baking until 
well-toasted on both sides. This is indeed hard enough to require soaking in a liquid before attempting to chew it. The taste also leaves something to be desired, but 
it will stay edible for extended periods of time. I haven't been able to duplicate the traditional circular shape mentioned by Koukoules as the dough tends to lose its
 shape unless put into a pan."<br>---<i>Byzantine Cuisine</i> (p. 139-141)

<a name="pitta">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Pita</b></font><br>
These versatile middle-eastern flatbreads are perhaps the oldest breads known. Soft and thin, they
provided the basis for a variety of popular portable items, most notably pizza, and a variety of
filled pocket or rolled sandwiches. Modern menus often call these "wraps." Asian and European
pancakes are related in both method and function.
<p>
"Pitta (or pita or pitah...) Is a flat, roughly oval, slighly leavened type of bread characteristic of
Greece and the Middle East. Typically eaten slit open and stufed with filling, it became a familiar
sight on the supermarket shelves of Britain and the USA in the last quarter of the twentieth
century. The word, a borrowing from modern Greek, can perhaps be traced back ultimately to
classical Greek peptos,  'cooked'...a derivative of the verb pessein,  'cook, bake'."<br>

"Pita. <br>
The Israeli and western name for the Arab bread called khubz  adi (ordinary bread) or names
meaning  Arab, Egyptian, Syrian bread or kumaj (a Turkish loanword properly meaning a bread
cooked in ashes), baked in a brick bread oven. It is slightly leavened wheat bread, flat, either
round or oval, and variable in size...The name had a common origin with pizza...In the early
centuries of our era, the traditional Greek word for a thin flat bread or cake, plakous, had become
the name of a thicker cake. The new word that came into use for flat bread was pitta, literally
 pitch, doubtless because pine pitch naturally forms flat layers which many languages compare to
cakes or breads...The word spread to Southern Italy as the name of a thin bread. In Northern
Italian dialects pitta became pizza, now known primarily as the bearer of savoury toppings but
essentially still a flat bread...Early Arab cookery texts do not refer to khubz, since it was bought
from specialists, not made in the home. However, it is safe to assume that its history extends far
into antiquity, since flatbreads in general, whether leavened or not, are among the most ancient
breads, needing no oven or even utensil for their baking."<br>

<b>Roti & Paratha</b><br>
Roti is ancient, parata/paratha, a related bread, dates to the 10th century. <a href="foodbreads.html#naan">Naan</a> is an oval roti and made from 
wine white maida. Roti was introduced to the <a href="foodbreads.html#caribbeanroti">Caribbean</a> by Indian immigrants.
<p>
"Roti. A general Indian term for bread. In this sense it covers the whole amazingly diverse range of breads 
found in the subcontinent. However, it is also used in narrower senses, for example in some parts of India as 
an alternative name for chapati and phulka, or as part of the names of particular breads. The origins of roti, 
as the wide meaning of Indian breads, can be traced back 3,000 or 4,000 years, to the arrival of the Aryans 
in the Indus Valley. In this connection it is noteworthy that barley was the major grain eaten by the Aryans. 
Although wheat was known from very early times, its widespread adoption for bread-making purposes came 
relatively late...Numerous names of breads incorporate the term roti. These may reflect the method of 
cooking (tandoori roti); or something to do with the shape and size (roomali roti is as thin as the scarf for 
which it is named). But more often they refer to the type of flour used; thus besan ki roti contains chickpea 
(besan) flour. Roti in the wide sense have become an important element in the intercontinental culinary 
scene, mainly because so many of these Indian unleavened breads have spread to other parts of the world 
where Indians and their foodways have become established..." <br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 673) 
<p>
"Parata, or Paratha, an Indian flaky bread prepared by smearing the dough, which is unleavened and is also 
enriched with oil, with ghee or oil and folding the dough three times. More ghee or oil is brushed over and 
the process is repeated. The resulting packet of dough is then rolled out to the required size and fried in oil 
or dry cooked on a tava or griddle. The layers of pastry separate and flake while frying. Paratas are often 
stuffed with spicy mixtures of meat or vegetables before frying. A similar bread is made in Afghanistan and 
Nepal." <br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 575) 
<p>
"Parata, paranta. Wheat dough rolled out with frequent folding over while smearing with fat, to a square or 
triangular shape and pan-fried using a little fat to a layery texture...Many of these are of considerable 
antiquity, both the puige (later termed holige) and the mandate being mentioned on a Kannada work of AD 
920, the Vaddaradane of Shivakotyacharya." <br>

<b>Caribbean roti?</b><br>
"Of all the immigrant ethnic groups, Indians coming to the Caribbean as indentured servants did not recognize the majority of food 
items that they were given to eat as part of their rations. Their diet consisted mainly of staple carbohydrates and some seasonal 
vegetables. Most could not afford any additional supplement to their diet as they would have been charged for extra food items 
and their wages were almost nonexistent. Indian families could usually afford only the ingredient to make their traditional 
breads, chappatai or roti, which required only flour and water, and which were made on a special griddle, called a tawa, brought 
by Indian immigrants to the Caribbean. However, they could not afford to make the traditional accompaniments to go with these 
breads, like dahl, a type of porridge made from lentils. Instead, they would eat these breads with some of the local 
Caribbean varieties of pepper, or wild spinach (called baji). Judging by their availability and the frequency of their consumption 
by many ethnic groups, chappati and roti, especially, are still some of the most popular Indian foods in the Caribbean." <br>

<b>"Roti (bread) </b><br>
Roti simply means bread, and this is the term most often used in Trinidad for parathas, which is what these are. They are 
of Indian origin, but like everything else in the Caribbean, have evolved form the original. One 12-inch roti makes a magnificent 
lunch when a generous dollop of currie chicken, kid, shrimp or potatoes is placed in the center, and the bread is folded over it 
like an envelope. One can eat it with a knife and fork; fingers however, are more fun. The 8-inch roti is served as a bread with curries. 
I have two versions of roti, one a little more elaborate than the other, both very good. <br>
2 cups all-purpose flour <br>
1 teaspoon baking powder <br>
1 teaspoon salt <br>
3 tablespoons butter,or vegetable shortening <br>
Ghee <br>
Extra flour <br>
Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Rub in the butter or shortening with the fingertips until the fat is in 
small flakes. Pour 1/4 cold water over the flour and mix to make a fairly stiff dough. Add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, 
until the dough holds together but is not sticky. Knead until smooth. Cover, and leave in a warm place for half an hour. Knead 
again for 3 or 4 minutes then divide into 4 equal balls. Roll out on a floured board into 12- or 8-inch rounds. Brush lightly all 
over with ghee, then sprinkle with flour. Fold in half, then in half again, to form a 4-layered quarter circle. Cover and leave for 
half an hour. Then shape roughly into a circle with the hands, and roll out into a floured board into 12- or 8-inch rounds. Heat a 
cast-iron frying pan or griddle so that a little flour sprinkled on it will brown instantly, or on the griddle and cook for about 
a minute. Turn, and spread again with ghee. Cook for 1 minute longer than then. Hit with a wooden mallet all over until it is flaky. 
Wrap in a towel and keep warm until the other roti are cooked. Serve at once. Serves 4. <br>
2 cups all-purpose flour <br>
1/4 teaspoon baking soda <br>
1/2 teaspoon salt <br>
Milk, or water to mix <br>
Ghee...or vegetable oil <br>
Sift the flour, baking soda, and salt into a bowl. Add enough milk or water to mix to a stiff dough. Knead the dough thoroughly on 
a lightly floured board. Form into 4 balls and roll out into 8-inch circle. Brush all over with ghee or vegetable oil and fold into 
a ball again. Cover and allow to stand for about 15 minutes. Roll out again into 8-inch circles. Heat a cast-iron frying pan or 
griddle until a drop of water will sputter when dripped on it, or a little flour with brown instantly. Cook the roti for about 1 
minute, turn, spread with ghee or vegetable oil and cook, turning frequently until the roti is baked. Remove from the pan and 
clap with both hands until pliable. Wrap in towel to keep warm the other roti are cooked. Serve at once. Serves 4." <br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Lavash</b> (Armenian flat bread)</font><br>
Lavosh, lahvosh, lavash, Armenian cracker bread: a flat bread with ancient roots.
According to the food historians, Lavash was/is popular in the Caucasus and neighboring
middle-eastern regions. The ancient recipe remains virtually unchanged. Current applications for
this bread product reflect a broad range of culinary adaptation and professional creativity.
Foodservice professionals agree wraps (of all kinds) are hot. Lavash are baked in <a href="foodbreads.html#tandoor">tandoor ovens</a>.
<p>

"Lavash<br>
a thin crisp bread usually made with wheat flour made in a variety of shapes all over
the regions of the Caucasus, Iran (where it is often so thin as to be like tissue and can
be almost seen through), and Afghanistan. It is leavened and baked in a tandoor.
Lavash is served with kebabs and is used to scoop up food or wrap round food before
being eaten...Its origins are ancient and it is also known a lavash depending upon the
region. As in the other countries of this region large batches of this bread are made and
stored for long periods. "<br>

<p>
"The more charming feature of lavash is its versatility. Lavash can be used as a plate, a saucepan, a
spoon, or a napkin. Ranging from soft and pliable to crisp and cracker-like, lavash is a staple throughout the
Caucasus, Iran, Lebanon, and Syria. In Armenia, it became an important form of national self-expression and
wisdom...A very special tool is the batat or rabata, a wool- or hay-filled cushion used for stretching the dough. Every
Armenian household would have a set ot two batats: one large and one small. The bug cushion was used for baking lavach, while the
little one was for smaller and thicker circle bread...Tradionally, lavash is baked in a typical Middle Eastern tandoor-style
oven, called a tonir in Armenia...Armenians used to bake lavash in autumn, to be stored for use throughout the winter. It was dried,
stacked in piles, covered with clith, and stowed away. Top make the dried lavash soft again, it was moistened with water and 
covered with cloth for half an hour."<br>

"One of the things that is absolutely compelling about flatbreads is that they are old,
really old. Many of the flatbreads eaten today have changed little over the last several
thousand years. Flatbreads, such as sanguake in Iran, lavash in Armenia, and fetir
made by the Bedouin in Israel, are all of ancient origin. When people first began
cultivating grain, flatbreads were an obvious solution to the problem of how to turn hard
grain into edible food; the grain could be pounded into flour, mixed with water, and
cooked on a hot stone. The earliest method of cooking flatbreads probably involved
spreading a dough or a batter over a very hot rock, then peeling the bread off from the
rock when it had finished cooking, a method still used by the Hopi in making their
remarkable blue corn piki bread. It is also very much like the Bedouin breads from
Jordan. Oven-baked flatbreads most likely came into existence not long after, as the
idea was essentially the same. Instead of cooking the bread on a rock that had been
heated in, or over, a fire, the bread could be baked in a "room" of hot rock or clay that
had been preheated with fire. 
     A tandoor oven (an oven of ancient origin still in use all the way from western China
to India to Mali in central Africa) operates on this principle. After the oven is preheated,
flatbreads (often called naan) are slapped against the hot oven walls, then skillfully
lifted off when they are done. Ovens can bake more bread than skillets or stove-top 
methods, and in a shorter period of time, but they also tend to require more wood, coal,
or dried dung, whatever the local fuel resource happens to be. 
     The Bedouin in southern Tunisia and Algeria use an exceptionally low-tech and
fuel-efficient baking method. Hot coals are placed into a hole that has been dug into the
desert sand. The bakers place flattened pieces of bread dough onto the coals and then
cover it with more coals and sand. When the breads are baked (a timing learned only
from experience), the sand is pushed aside and the breads lifted out. A few slaps get
rid of any sand still clinging to them. For most people who eat flatbreads on a daily
basis, the breads are a staff of life. For a villager in north India, a town dweller in 
Uzbekistan, a Kurdish nomad in eastern Turkey, a day without flatbreads is
unthinkable. Flatbreads are a part of every meal, day after day, year after year. "<br>

"There are many different flatbreads baked throughout the easter Mediterranean, the Middle East
and India--from pita or naan--but lavash is perhaps the oldest. This bread-in-various shapes and
sizes, and in textures ranging from soft and pliable to crisp and crackerlike--is a staple throughout
Armenia and in parts of Georgia, Iran, and Lebanon. Armenian lavash has been prepared in the
same way for thousands of years: Long sheets of dough are stretched and baked in a clay oven
similar to an Indian tandoor. The nomadic peoples crisscrossing Asia knew a good thing when
they saw it: A filled and rolled-up lavash sandwich might be the ultimate in picnic fare (easily
transportable, its food, eating utensil, and container all in one). Lavash is also delicious served
with stews such as Morrocan tagine or an Indian curry, or with a favorite dip."<br>

<b>What is a tandoor oven?</b><br>
The classic oven used by peoples of India from ancient times to present (including the
 Medieval period) is called a tandoor. This special oven can be used to cook a variety of
 foods, including bread.
 <p>
 Tandoor. The middle Eastern clay oven, found from Arab countries to India. The
 original Babylonian form of the name, timuru, is probably related to nar, the Semitic
 word for fire...In the tandoor, the breads (necessarily flat in shape) are slapped onto the
 vertical wall, where they bake quite quickly by a combination of radiant heat and
 convection. After the day's bread-making, casseroles and other dishes may be baked in a
 tandoor (as in a brick oven) to use the residual heat. In cold climates, the tandoor also
 heats the house, like the hearth in Europe...In the Middle Ages, skewered meats were
 more often roasted in a tandoor than over burning coals, as they still are in Central Asia.
 Tandoor meat cookery has been popular in India since 1948, when a Kashmiri restaurant
 named Moti Mahal became a fashionable dining spot for politicians in New Delhi. As a
 result, Indian tandoor restaurants have sprung up all around the world."<br>
 ---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davison [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999
 (p. 781)
 <p>
 "In India the processes of baking, roasting, and grilling are all achieved by tandoori
 cooking. This is because the food is prepared in a tandoor, which simultaneously bakes,
 roasts, and grills. The tandoor is believed to have originated in the northeastern part of
 Persia (present-day Iran). Its use spread to different parts of the continent with
 migrations, and as a result, today the tandoor is used in all of Central Asia...In India the
 tandoor was initially built for the purpose of baking breads (still its main use). The
 dough is stretched and shaped into flat breads and smacked onto the sides of the pit, to
 which it adheres. It puffs up and bakes in 7 to 10 minutes. The cooked breads are then
 peeled off gently with long metal skewers specially designed for this purpose. In the
 earlier part of the nineteenth cnetury, in Peshawar, a city in the northwest frontier region
 of Pakistan (the part of India), an ingenious method  for cooking meat was invented and
 introduced. Today, it has become one of the most popular cooking methods in India. In
 this process, whole chickens and large chunks of lamb were threaded on specially
 designed long skewers, lowered into the tandoor pit, and cooked. Any food thus cooked
 was referred to as tandoori food...Just about any meat that can be threaded on skewers
 can be cooked in a tandoor."<br>

 history or reference to Medieval times.]
 <p>
 "Tandoor. At the Indus Valley site of Kalibangan were found small, mudplastered ovens
 with a side opening 'very strongly resembling the present-day 'tandoors'. Live embers are
 placed at the bottom and fanned briskly so that they glow, raising the temperature of the
 clay sides. Thick, slighly leavened wheat rotis called naan and tandoori are slapped on
 to the sides to cook, with some puffing and surface charring in patches. Meat and fish
 can also be tandoor-grilled."<br>

 "A tandoor is shaped rather like the juge jar in which Ali Baba hid from the Forty
 Thieves. It is usually sunk neck-deep in the ground or, if  built above ground, is heavily
 insulated on the outside with a thick layer of plaster. The charcoal fire on the flat bottom
 of the jar should heat the sides of the tandoor to a scorching point about halfway up, and
 to a hot glow for the rest, diminishing, of course, near the neck. To achieve this
 particular distribution of heat, the tandoor has to be lit at least two hours before anything
 is cooked in it, and longer if it is not frequently used."<br>

Food historians confirm bread has been baked in clay vessels from ancient times forward. Clay vessels were also used
 for slow cooking meats and stews in several cultures and cuisines. The Indian <a href="foodbreads.html#tandoor">tandoor</a> is one of the popular
examples. <a href="foodbreads.html#claybaking">Clay pots & ovens</a> were an efficient, effective, and economical way to 
cook. Flower bread is indeed a modern twist on a very old theme!
Our survey of contemporary U.S. magazine/newspaper articles indicates the resurgance of interest in clay baking in the 
early 1980s. La Cloche brand stoneware [Sassafras Entertrpises, Inc.] containers were marketed to upscale consumers in 
high end gourmet supply shops. 
<p>
<b>Where does Flower Pot Bread fit in?</b><br>
Our research indicates this novelty baked good became popular in the late 1960s. We do not find any particular person, place, or
restaurant credited for the "invention" of this loaf. Early print references in British souces may indicate the item originated there.
The use of cracked wheat and other natural grains connects some flower pot bread recipes with the "back to nature" health food movement du jour.
<p>
"Terracotta flower pots make admirable bread moulds. Anyone who still possesses some of these now nearly obsolete pots may like to
try the following method. The best size of a pot for a loaf is 5 1/2 inches in diameter by 4 1/2 inches deep. First temper the pots
for baking by coating them liberally outside and inside with oil and leaving them empty in the oven while bread or something else
is baking at a fairly high temperature. Do this two or three times. Once they are well impregnated with oil the pots will 
need very little greasing, and the baked loaves will slip out of the pots without the slightest sign of sticking...The trick 
about making good flowerpot bread is to bake the loaves upside down. This is easier than it sounds: when the dough has fully risen
for the second time, break it down, knead it very thorougly and divide it into two equal pieces. Shape and fit each into a 
warmed and greased flower pot...What hapens when the loaves are under the flower pots is that during the first few minutes of baking
the dough springs up and fills the pot, producing a perfectly even and well formed loaf, whereas if the pot is put upright into
the oven in the normal way the dough rises unevenly over the top, making an untidy loaf with a mushroom top which often sticks to the
sides of the pot...Cracked wheat or coarse oatmeal can be scattered at the bottom of the pots and on the sides before the dough
is put in."<br>

<blockquote>
<b>"Flower Pot Bread</b><br>
2 cups milk<br>

<b>About baking with clay:</b><br>
"The earliest method of baking bread was to place lumps of dough, unleavened, on hot stones in the embers of a wood fire, 
and leave them to cook until they were hard. In other words it was the bakestone sytem, and after countless thousands of 
years it still survives...Baking on stones was followed...as early as the Bronze Age in Europe by the method of inverting a 
pot over the bread and surrounding this pot oven with hot embers. By this means the bread was protected from the ashes, and
 the covering pot drew the dough upwards, so that, even before the discovery of leavening, it would rise slighty, and 
lighter bread resulted. The inverted-pot system was certainly still quite commonly used in Britain less than a century 
ago...Another baking utensil similar in effect to the inverted iron pot was the dome-shaped clay cooking bell evolved by 
the earliest potters of Greece...This agian, or something like it in metal, has survived until today, and very useful it is. 
Oven proper seen to have come into being as a means of combining the hearth or baking stone and the covering pot in one 
single fixed construction, some of the earliest ovens having an opening at the apex through which the bread could be 
introduced The opening was sealed with stones or pieces of clay, and live embers piled up all round and over the oven. The
 crude beehive-shaped or tunnel-like clay ovens with a front opening which developed later provided a more satisfactory 
way of feeding the bread into the oven...the brick-built oven with tile floor, as distinct from the archaic little clay 
oven, which probably originated sometime betweeen 3000 and 1800 B.C.. Like the Athenian cooking bell and the primitive 
quern, the rough clay oven had its counterparts for several thousand years, among its descendants being our own 
seventeeth-century Devon gravel-tempered clay oven walls...These crude ovens differ hardly at all in form from those of 
the Neolithic Age."<br>
---<i>English Bread and Yeast Cookery</i>, Elizabeth David, American edition with notes by Karen Hess [Penguin:New York] 1980 (p. 155-7) 
<p>
"...fireclay ovens were not invariably built into the wall but sometimes left free-standing...'They make such use here...
of Cloume ovens, which are earthenware of several sizes, like an oven, and being heated they stop em up and cover em over 
with embers to keep in the heat.'."<br>
---<i>ibid</i>, (p. 178) 
<p>
"It was the Egyptians who first used a manufactured portable oven. This was a beehive-or barrel-shaped container of baked 
clay, usually divided into two by a central horizontal partition. The lower section formed the fire-box in which were 
burned pieces of dried wood, often taken from the Nile, or even dried animal dung. The upper part accessible from the top,
 was the baking chamber."<br>

"Focaccia or fougasse, a flat bread which belongs essentially to the northern shores of the
Mediterranean and has its origin in classical antiquity. In ancient Rome panis focacius denoted a
flat bread cooked in the ashes ("focus" meant hearth). These came the term focacia, focaccia in
modern Italian, fougasse in the south of France, and fouace in the north of France...in France this
form of bread had become a luxury item by the end of the middle ages. It could be, as at Amiens,
a simple white bread; or it could be enriched as in Provence, where 14th and 15th century
documents equate it with placentula, i.e. a sort of  'cake'. This enrichment made the product so
different from plain bread that in at least one place it escaped a tax on bread. For many centuries it
has had an association with Christmas Eve and Epiphany...In the Italian context one thing is
obvious, namely that the addition of topping to a plan focaccia would result in a kind of pizza.
However, apart from this aspect, Italian focaccia has branched out in various directions, both
savoury and sweet...Numerous regional specialties such as the fitascetta of Lombardy, the Tuscan
stiacciata, and the schiacciata of Emelia are all descendants. Also, a focaccia may be made with
flavourings such as onion and sage or anise, or honey, etc."<br>

Food historians agree recipes titled Anadama bread, a yeast bread composed of wheat flour, cormeal, and molasses, originated in the Boston area. There are 
several legends and stories regarding the origin, each more intriguing than the next. None proveable to the exclusion of the others. Our examination of colonial and 
early American  New England cookbooks does not reveal recipes by this title. We did find, however, the combination of the aforementioned ingredients was quite 
common. Johnny cakes, Indian bread, etc. centered upon cornmeal and molasses. No wonder? These ingredients were the mainstays of early New England 
subsistence. 
<p>
"Anadama bread. A bread made from cornmeal and molasses. The term dates in print to 1915, but is probably somewhat older. If it were not for the frequency of 
their citation, it would be difficult to believe the story most often cited is of a Gloucester, Massachusetts, fisherman's wife named Anna, who gave her husband 
nothing but cornmeal and molasses to eat every day. One night the fisherman got so angry, he tossed the ingredients in with some yeast and flour and made a bread
 in the oven while muttering to himself, "Anna, damn her!" A more affectionate story has  a New England sea captain referring to his wife with the same name 
expletive as a phrase of endearment. This Anna was apparently adept at bread-baking, and she became well known for her cornmeal-and-molasses loaf among the
 fishing crews who appreciated this long-lasting, hearty bread. There was, supposedly, a gravestone to this legendary woman that read, Anna wes a lovely bride, 
but Anna, Damn'er, up and died. One source contends that a commerical bakery called ist product "Annadammer" or "Annadama bread."<br>

serve Anadama bread. The bread's varying legends reveal a simple, home cooked regional food. Whether created by a colonial settler, who added flavorful indigenous 
ingredients to an English yeast bread, or by a post-Revolutionary housewife, in a community whose cuisine harked back to  seventheenth-century English cooking,

"Until the advent of the large-scale commerical baking in the late 19th century, all American berad was artisanal: mixed and shaped by hand, then baked under the eye of a
 professional baker or home cook. But when soft, sweet, snow-white commercial bread appeared on grocery shelves in the 1930's, coarse-grained, handmade loaves lost
 their appeal. And then came the Wonder Bread Years, when packaged slice bread became virtually synonomous with American food. In the 1970s, the health-food
 movement enthusiastically embraced whole grains and home-baked bread, a hallmark of counter-culture cuisine. By the 1990s, artisanal bread was swept up in the wave 
of gourmet appreciation that brought extra virgin olive oil, dark-roast coffee and European cheeses to stores. The wide appeal of artisanal bread first became clear about
 10 years ago when bakers in many areas persuaded supermarket managers to stock their products. Ms. Silverton of La Brea first tried parbaking for the Southern

"Bread is such a basic part of our diet that we scarcely think about it...We eat it every day, and for some of us, raised in the postwar days of "batter whipped" bread, we 
assume it should be soft, spongy white stuff. Not necessarily at all. Witness the resurrgence of interest in bread--all kinds of bread, but particualrly hearty, whole-grain, 
substantial loaves...'Breadmaking basically skipped a generation...In the prewar era, that is what you had...people in their 70's are coming in and saying they haven't had 
this kind of bread in 50 years. Others are discovering it: it's a lost art, the way bread had been, and should be.'"<br>

"Give a man a loaf of bread, and he'll eat for a day. Teach a man to bake bread, in, say, a converted pajama factory in Queens, and his prospects will brighten 
considerably. That, at least, is the concept behind a school in Long Island City that is teaching the jobless the lost art of making bread by hand in an effort to revive a 
dying New York City industry. Eighteen students, covered in flour and sweat, assembled recently on the first floor of the school, the Artisian baking Center, and spent
 much of the day scurrying among huge barrels of flour, poppy seeds, brown sugar and oats. The students include New Yorkers moving from welfare to work, ex-convicts,
 high school dropouts, professional bakers taking refresher courses and the unemployed, all potentially part of a new generation of fancy-bread bakers...The baking
 industry, once a thriving piece of the New York City economy, that employed thousands of bread, cake, bagel and bialy bakers, has replaced bakers with machines. 
However, the demand for handmade bread has surged in the United States in the last decade, as more Americans choose focaccia or olive soudough baguettes over
 factory-made loaves. With skilled bakers in short supply, the federal Department of Labor idenitified New York City as a place in need of a baking school and, in 2000, 
gave $1.7 million to help start the first formal baking training program in the city and one of the few such programs in the country...So far, the center has placed 27 people
 in jobs, and employers have begun recruiting directly from the center...Until now, anyone serious about learning the art of baking artisan, or handmade, bread typically
 went to Kansas, to the American Institute of Baking...or enrolled in an expensive course or two at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y....Mr. Bernstein 
said the decline of the artisan bread industry was driven in part by many bakers' reluctance to give away their recipes for breads and other goods. When their sons and
 daughters decided not to go into the baking industry, they often closed up shop without passing along their trade secrets...'The true craftsmen were afraid to teach,' Mr 
Bernstein said, 'But we're bringing back an old tradition.'...In 1971, 12,402 people in the five boroughs...were employed by bread and cake bakers...In 1997...there were 
4,555 people employed in the same industry. However, as more small retail bakeries in New York City have begun selling fancy baked goods, the number of jobs in that 
niche has increased..."<br>

"Jim Amaral has had a nice business going since Hannaford Brothers' supermarket started carrying his handmade breads in 2001. But one morning last month while his
 baker shuffled focaccias, scones and organic whole-wheat breads into the soapstone oven Mr. Amaral built in a corner of the Hannaford store. Hannaford employees were
 pulling racks of sourdough rounds and baguettes from industrial steel ovens nearby.  Those loaves seemed as crust and aromatic as Mr. Amaral's handmade breads. The 
hands that made them, though, were in a factory in New Jersey, where the bread was partly baked and flash frozen in a process called parbaking. Days, weeks or perhaps
 months ago, the frozen bread was shipped to Hannaford's. This morning, a few minutes in the steel ovens prodced bread to order. Over the last four years, a few big 
parbaking companies have brought supermarket shoppers around the country so-called artisan breads. Sales of the breads--hand-formed, all natural, dark-crusted loaves 
once found only in small bake shops--rose 10 percent last year, according to Mintel Consumer Intelligence, a market-research company, even as the rest of the industry 
cowered before the low-carb onslaught. But many bakers say that parbaking creates artisanal bread without the artisan and that bread makers in several communities 
have been driven out of business after supermarkets started selling parbaked loaves...What is at stake nationwide is an almost $2 billion slices of the $16 billion bread
 industry. Last year, sales of artisanal and artisan-style bread in supermarkets and big chains nationwide grew faster than the business as a whole, and almost 20 times
 faster than white bread, according to Mintel...'Foccacia, levain, ciabatta, ficelles--over 10 years ago, who knew what a ficelle was?'...Parbaking, pioneered by European 
baking corporations, was introduced in the United States by one of the most respected figures of artisanal baking, Nancy Silverton of La Brea Bakery in Los Angeles, 
about five years ago..."<br>

The origin of the bagel is still an issue for debate. Most contemporary food historians conclude the bagel is of Jewish 
origin, probably in Poland, sometime in the 17th century. Maria Balinska's new book <i>The Bagel: The Surprising History 
of a Modern Bread</i>, [2008] traces the family of bagel-type breads to medieval Italy. She pushes back widely accepted 
dates and provides additional insights with regards to this food's evolution and subsequent diaspora. 
<p>
Traditional bagel history notes here:<br>
"Theories abound as to their [bagels] origin. The word derives from 'beigen,' German for 'to bend,'
and the bagel is a descendant of the pretzel. The first Jewish community in Poland, established by
invitation and charter in the thirteenth century, probably brought 'biscochos' with them. The boiled
and baked roll with a hole dates possible from the Roman period....Today, in Cracow, where
some
say the present-day form of bagel was born, the bagel is alive and well, sold on many street
corners."<br>
---<i>Jewish Cooking in America</i>, Joan Nathan [Knopf:New York] 1994 (p. 83-4)
 <p>
"The bagel is a Jewish bread, apparently originating in South Germany, migrating to Poland and
thence to North America where it has become the most famous and archetypal Jewish food. Its
name derives from the Yiddish word  'beygal' from the German dialect word  'beugel,' meaning 
ring' or  bracelet.' Its history means, of course, that it is an
Ashkenazi rather than a Sephardi food. As Claudia Roden points out:  Because of their
shape--with no beginning and no end--bagels symbolize the eternal cyle of life.'"<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] (p. 49)
<p>  
"In the <i>Joys of Yiddish</i>, Leo Rosten notes that "The first printed mention of bagels...is to
be found in the Community Regulations of Kracow, Poland, for the year 1610-which stated that
bagels would be given as a gift to any woman in childbirth." He adds that the word is derived
from the German word  beugel, meaning  a round loaf of bread. There are those who dispute this
and claim that it derives from the middle High German word 'bugel,' which means a twisted or
curved bracelet or ring..."<br>
---<i>Craig Claiborne's The New York Times Food Encyclopedia</i>, Craig Claiborne [Times
Books:New York] 1985 (p. 23)
<p>
"...It's believed that bagels were invented by a Jewish baker in Vienna in 1683. To thank King
John III Sobieski of Poland for saving the city from Turkish invaders, the anonymous baker
crafted a hard roll in the shape of a riding stirrup, in honor of the king's favorite hobby. The
bread's original name was 'bugel,' from the German for stirrup." It's high time that that piece of
fakelore be laid to rest. The earliest known use of the Yiddish word "beygl" is in the communal
rules that the leaders of the Jewish community of Cracow promulgated in 1610. The rules
stipulate that bagels are among the gifts which may be given to women in childbirth and to
midwives. The word was thus being used at least 73 years before John III Sobieski defeated the
Turks. The bagel, in fact, is even older. When a word or expression is new or thought to be little
known, it is often defined... yet the communal rules of 1610 contain no definition or explanation.
Hence it is clear that the word beygl was well established in Cracow Yiddish of the early 17th
century. Indeed, since those rules allude to earlier communal rules about bagels, we may be
certain that this bread is even older. We do not know when and where the bagel was invented nor
whether its inventor was a Jew or a German. Contrary to popular opinion, Yiddish beygl is not
derived from German bugel, although the two words are distant cousins."<br>

"In the book <i>Menu Mystique</i>, Norman Odya Krohn, discussing Russian bubliki , writes:
"This is the name for the original bagel that was made famous in Russian song and rhyme." Held
together by string, they were said to have been sold at Russian fairs and were believed to bring
good luck. Wherever it might have first appeared, the bagel's name as we know it today evolved
slowly; based on the Yiddish verb beigen, meaning "to bend," the roll with the hole was called a
beygel.The bagel persevered and flourished in Europe for a few centuries before heading for
foreign shores. In the United States, the bagel first appeared at Ellis Island, brought by Jewish
refugees leaving Eastern Europe shortly after the turn of the 20th Century. However, the
destination for most emigrants was New York City, and here the bagel settled."<br>

<B>About bagels in the United States</b><br>
"As a child I lived in Larchmont, New York. Every Sunday, my father would bring back bagels
from one of the thirty or so bagel bakers who still practiced their art in the fifties in New York
City....By the mid-1950s my father was a part of a growing Jewish Sunday-morning tradition of
men who went out to buy bagels, cream cheese, and lox so their wives could sleep in...Today
bagels have become such a part of American culture that Dunkin' Donuts and Burger King carry
them...Until the late fifties bagels were handcrafted in little two-or three-man cellar bakeries
sprinkled around New York's Lower East Side...In these cellars the oven was built so low that a
pit two or three feet deep had to be dug in front of it for the man working the oven. By 1907 the
International Beigel Bakers' Union was created, but by the mid-twenties the number of bagel
bakeries declined as Jews turned away from their old folk customs...In 1951 a Broadway comedy,
<i>Bagels and Yox</i>, put the word bagel into such mainstream magazines as <i>Time</i>;
bagels were distributed at intermission. That same year <i>Family Circle</i> included a recipe for
bageles (its spelling)...."Even up to the 1950s, you literally could not give a bagel away from
Monday to Saturday," said Murray Lender, son of the founder of Lender's bagels. "Most people
still thought of it as a Jewish dish." But clearly, if bagels were featured in <i>Family Circle</i>,
they were on the way to recognition in America. Mr. Lender's father...came to New Haven in
1927 and bought a small roll and bread bakery. In 1955 when he got out of the service and went
into his dad's business, Lender's started to expand, packaging their bagels to sell in
supermarkets...In 1962 Lender's bought and made operational the first bagel machine. At the
same time they began freezing bagels, which they marketed nationally under the Lender's
brand..."<br>

<b>When did the "Everything Bagel" appear on menus?</b><br>
The "Everything Bagel" concept makes perfect sense on two levels (1) "waste not, want not" (efficient way to use up leftover toppings) (2) "more is better" 
(1980s culinary mantra). We have no clue which of these inspired the first "everything bagel." 
<p>
It is perfectly possible <a href="http://TheEverythingBagel.com">Mr. Gussin's claim</a> for introducing the "everything bagel" c., 1970s is plausible. We cannot, however, confirm it in print. This is not unusual in the food world. New products are introduced locally all the time. Established commercial food manufacturers work regularly through a process which includes trade marking product names. Local food establishments/owners/bakers/chefs are generally unencumbered by said process. Competing products with different names are difficult to trace without ready access to ingredients and method. It's not unusual to have one product known by several names. How many ways can you define "everything," yes? 
<p>
Most food claimants float under the radar UNTIL something they invented goes viral and it becomes an issue of compensation or pride. When everyone claims a piece of the original pie things can get nasty. This is nothing new. Think: Ice Cream Sundaes. 
<p>
A short course on current USA food-related legal property rights. There are three choices for protection: Patent (manufacturing process/equipment), Trademark (brand names) & Copyright (intellectual property, sometimes including recipes). The first two protections are managed by the US Patent & Trademark Office (http://www.uspto.gov); the last is handled by the Library of Congress (http://copyright.gov). In sum? You can't patent the "Everything Bagel." You can patent a process for achieving a particular product, a trade name ("everything bagel" is currently unregistered) or recipe (not a generic list of ingredients, only scope/explanatory notes). 
<p>
The earliest print reference we find for an "Everything Bagel" is dated 1988: "Arkady Goshchinsky came here from the 
Soviet Union 11 years ago. After he was laid off as a nuclear plant engineer...he began for looking for another line of 
work. Thanks for friends in the bakery-supply business, three years ago, [he] wound up with a bagel store in Forest Hills 
Queens at 64-01 108th Avenue. Now, the Bagel Baron as his company is called, has a Manhattan location...The 'everything 
bagel' is dusted with salt, poppy seeds, sesame seeds, garlic and onion. Bagels...are 50 cents each."<br>

Food historians tell us <a href="foodbreads.html#breadhistory">bread</a> was "invented" in 10,000BC.
Techniques spread throughout
the world and evolved according to custom, cuisine, and local grain. Baguette, the hard crusty loaf we currently associate with
France dates only to the
Industrial Revolution. Steam ovens, made possible by scientific advancement, are key in the
manufacture of this
particular bread. In fact? Baguette is not French at all...it was invented by the bakers of Vienna.
<p>

"A baguette is a long thin loaf of French bread of the type more commonly known in English as 
'French stick', or more
vaguely still, as  'French loaf'. The term has become increasingly familiar in English since the
1960s. It means literally
 'littlerod', and is a diminutive form derived ultimately from Latin  'baculum',  'stick staff'."<br>

"Notes on French Bread. For nearly all English people who have ever set foot in France, the
words  French bread' evoke
a golden-brown baguette or a long thin ficelle, the crust crisp and sweet with its characteristic
leaf-shaped surface cuts,
the crumb white and pitted with irregular holes, many of them very large. To us, the holes are a
part of the proper
character of this kind of bread...the French do use a good deal of soft flour, because that is what
is
produced from the
wheat grown in France. So they have long ago adapted their bread techniques to their flour. Or
rather, what they adapted
was the  'Vienna' technique, and this didn't happen until some time in the mid nineteenth cnetury; it
was the Viennese
oven, with its steam injectors and its sloping floor, or sole, which was mainly responsible for
creating the tradition of
French bread as we know it today.  English bakers, and indeed many of the older French ones,
still call this type of bread
 'Vienna' bread, the true French bread being the old round or cylindrical hand-shaped  'pain de
campagne' or  pain de
menage', plump, and crossed with cuts to that when baked the crust is of many different shades,
gradations and textures
and the crumb rather open and coarse. It is this bread which is now enjoying something of a
revival in France, perhaps
because the Vienna type has not taken very kindly to the short-time dough maturing and the rapid
mechanical kneading
and moulding techniques of the 1970s, partly  because a well made  'pain de campagne' keeps
much better than
 baguette' loves, which is to day that it will stay moist for as long as two days, even three, whereas
the long, crusty, thin
loaf is, as we know, stale within an hour of emerging from the oven, and for the French three days
is a long time to keep
a loaf of bread."<br>

<b>"Remarks concerning hearth breads--Vienna bread, French bread, Hard crust rolls.</b><br>
Vienna Bread which is made by either the Straight or Sponge-Dough method, differs in nearly
every shop, and in many
bakeries is far from being the genuine article. It requires a semi-tight dough and more age than for
Pan Bread. Likewise
for best results, a good supply of low pressure steam for the oven is indispensible. It was the
carefulness of the Vienna
baker, together with the good material employed, that made his loaf famous. It is chiefly care and
workmanship that give
Vienna bread its quality. 
     After the loaves are moulded, they are laid, smooth side down, on cloth-covered boards, with
the cloth pinched up
between the loaves, and allowed to rest until double in size; then cut and baked with a good
supply of steam. If no steam
is available, wash with water before cutting the loaves. Other bakers lay the loaves in boxes or on
boards in specially
built covers, dusting the boards with corn flour, rice polish, flour or finely ground bread crumbs,
setting the loaves far
enough apart to prevent sticking.  If boxes or boards are used in this manner, loaves must be laid
smooth side
up....French Bread is handled in much the same manner, only it requires a softer dough. Hard
crust Rolls can be made to
good advantage from either French or Vienna dough."<br>

<b>There is a rumor that Napoleon ordered his bakers to make long, thin loaves so they could be
transported in his soldier's pants. According to the food historians this is not true:</b>

"The baguette was said to have been invented during Napoleon's Russian campaign when he
ordered a new shape of bread that could be carried down his troops' trouser legs. In fact, it was
introduced in the 1920s after a new law banned bakers from working before 4am. They did not
have enough time to bake a fresh boule for breakfast, so they created the baguette."<br>

<p>
"American hyperbole is selling French bread abroad and, as the subsequent article shows,
American beer even in Munich. Upon entering a boulangerie, the mastery of a good French
baker is mouth-wateringly apparent from the buttery croissants and pains au chocolat displayed at
child's-eye level. The baguettes are stacked high behind the counter, their crusts crackling softly
as the heat seeps out of them. Lately this has become a moveable feast. Boulangeries have
appeared in cities across the world: Au Bon Pain in the United States, D(acute)elifrance across
Asia as well as countless patisseries in Europe. Of course, such establishments also
sell other breads, and cakes. But they deal chiefly in authenticity, wrapping themselves in the
tricolore, boasting in cute French phrases of baguettes made from French flour kneaded by
French hands. Sometimes they try even harder to establish their pedigree. The baguette was
invented during Napoleon's campaign in Russia, gushes the blurb of one. Traditional round
loaves took up space needed for extra clothes. Napoleon therefore ordered a new shape of bread
to be designed that could be carried down the soldiers' trouser-legs. What a load of old brioche.
The ingredients might come from France, but the marketing is straight from Madison Avenue.
The baguette is unmistakably French. It is also often delicious. But it is not that much more
traditional than the TGV express trains that slice their way through the French countryside. The
French word for baker is boulanger, he who makes boules, or round loaves, not a "baguettier"
who makes sticks. In fact the baguette dates back to the 1920s, and its progress has done to
traditional French baking what the white sliced has done to the British loaf. Changing technology
was partly responsible for the baguette's introduction. By the 1920s most French bakeries were
equipped with the steam ovens needed to caramelise the starch on the surface of the loaf to give it
a golden, slightly translucent crust. History also played a part. The first world war created a
shortage of manpower and traditional loaves prepared from a sourdough became too
labour-intensive for many bakers. But the coup de gr(circumflex)ace was legal. In October 1920 a
new
law came into force that prevented bakers from working before 4am, which meant that they did
not have time to bake a fresh boule for the breakfast table. They thus turned to the rapidly
prepared baguette. The baguette was a wow. Bakers liked it because it was convenient to make
and stayed fresh for only a few hours. Hence customers visited bakeries two or three times a day.
Consumers liked the baguette because it is whiter and sweeter than sourdough breads. As the
flour got whiter, the proving accelerated and the crumb became more like cotton-wool, France's
traditional breads, once almost as numerous as its cheeses, were forgotten. And yet, just as the
baguette is waging a campaign of Napoleonic proportions in international markets, at home there
has been something of a revival of traditional baking. Elizabeth David noted the trend as far back
as the late 1970s, in her classic book on bread and yeast cookery. In France itself, Lionel Poil
(circumflex) ane, a baker on the Left Bank in Paris, has built a career--and a business--baking
loaves in the traditional 19th-century way, with a rich, slightly sour flavour."<br>

This particular item is an excellent example of how attitudes sometimes change about the foods
we eat. In the 17th century and 18th centuries, Pilgrims and their descendants "made do" with
brown bread. Brown was a color. The grain was wheat (think: whole wheat) or <a href="foodbreads.html#rye">rye</a>. 
<a href="foodbreads.html#ryeindian">Rye and Indian bread</a> (rye & molasses) and <a href="foodbreads.html#thirded">Thirded bread</a> (equal parts rye, 
maize, wheat) graced tables together as "the poor cousins" to preferred <a href="foodbreads.html#flour">wheat flour</a>. 
In the 19th century, this product was elevated by two transformations: <br>
1. The advent of nutritional health reform...Sylvester Graham & Catharine Beecher<br>
2. Victorian nostalgia..."bread of the olden days" became a "new" fad. Coincidentally? This is
also period when "traditional" Thanksgiving customs were born. About <a href="foodbreads.html#ryebread">Rye bread</a>.
<p>
<i>American Cooking: New England</i>," Jonathan Norton Leonard, Time Life Books, (p. 35+)
devotes an entire chapter to 17th Century Puritan/Pilgrim grain cookery. This book explains why
the Puritans did not use white flour (too expensive & fancy; rye, wheat & corn flours were
plentiful & cheap). As for why this brown bread was steamed rather than baked, this book notes
that the first New England homes were very crude thatched huts and few had ovens. Cooking
was
generally done over an open fire. Steaming was an effective way to make bread without an oven.
After time, this cooking method established itself as the traditional way to prepare brown bread
(oft served as a Sunday meal with baked beans).  Other theories suggest that steaming was
employed because Puritans were forbidden to cook on the Sabbath.

<p>
"Once the Erie Canal was completed, connecting the port of New York and southern New
England with western New York State and newly settled lands around the Great Lakes, the cost
of wheat dropped, and the quantity available increased. New Engalnders seemed glad to give up
rye-and-Indian as the daily loaf in favor of bread made in part or entirely of wheat. Forms of
bread included loaves made of one-third each wheat, corn, and rye or from wheat and cornmeal.
When more refined wheat made white loaves possible and desirable, bread containing other
grains or shole, unbolted wheat, were called "brown bread" or "Graham brad." The old
combination of rye-and-Indian with or without wheat flour or meal evolved into a steamed
pudding by the middle to late nineteenth century. Sweetened with molasses and mixed with sour
milk and baking soda this concoction became known outside the region as "Boston brown bread"
and within New England simply as "brown bread."<br>

<b>Rye & Indian Bread</b><br>
This 'make do' bread was basically <a href="foodbreads.html#bostonbrown">Boston brown bread</a> without the raisins. The "Indian" in early American cooking texts refers to maize. In the
case of bread, specifically maize meal or flour. <a href="foodbreads.html#wilder">Laura Ingalls Wilder</a> referenced this bread in

"Ryaninjun and Brown Bread...the English settlers arrived in New England in the early
seventeenth century possesed of an ancient set of attitudes about which kinds of bread were more
and less desirable. Their longing for breads made exclusively with wheat could only begin to be
satisfied in the second quarter of the nineteenth century, after the opening of the Erie Canal made
wheat shipped in from areas to the west affordable. In Plymouth in the first few decades after
settlement, wheat ranked well bening corn in acerage planted and amounts yielded...As wheat
declined, rye tended to take its place...John Winthrop Jr, writing in 1662 before the difficulties of
growing wheat in New England had become fully apparent, provided one of the earliest
descriptions of Ryaninjun: "There is...very good Bread made of [Indian corn], by mixing half, or
a third parte, more or less of Ry, or Wheate-Meale, or Flower amongst it, and then they make it
up into Loaves, adding Leaven or yeast to it to make it Rise."...By all accounts, Ryaninjun quickly
ascended to the status of "the standard bread for brick-oven cookery." In the earliest colonial
period, when pans and other cooking utensils were expensive to import and forges for making
local wares were few, this food's advantage was its convenience. The dome-shaped loaves could
be baked without pans, directly on the oven floor or atop a bed of oak or cabbage leaves spread
across the bottom of the oven. The leaves were said to impart a distinctive flavor to the bread...In
the earliest published recipes, starting in 1829, the names "Rye and Indian" and "brown bread"
were used interchangeably...Until the mid-nineteeth century, brown bread was simply another
name for Ryaninjun. Around that time, however, as wheat bread became more widely available,
nostalgia becan to ennoble "the old brown bread" that had previously been mostly tolerated. The
long-established mixture of cornmeal and rye was placed on a tin (as opposed to bag) pudding
container and thus was born steamed Boston Brown Bread. A related development was the health
food movement of the 1830s spearheaded by Sylvester Graham...As early as 1839, Graham's
spirited efforts to overturn the ancient bias in favor of bolted wheat flour had met with success
sufficient to lead Sarah Josepha Hale to acknowledge that her recipe for "brown or dyspepsia
bread" might better have been called "Graham bread." However, Hale's brown bread was not
steamed Boston Brown Bread but rather a version of "bran bread," in our terms, oven-baked
whole wheat bread...A typical recipe for steamed brown bread from the second half of the
nineteenth century, "Mrs. Reed's Brown Bread," consisted of sour milk, baking soda, salt, two
level cups of "Indian meal," three heaping cups of "flour or Graham meal," and a cup of
molasses. This mixture was to be steamed for four hours and then browned lightly in an oven..."<br>

<b>Rye & Injun bread/Laura Ingalls Wilder</b><br>
The Rye'n'Injun bread referenced by Laura Ingalls Wilder in <i>Farmer Boy</i> is basically 
<a href="foodbreads.html#bostonbrown">Boston brown bread</a> without the raisins. America's earliest 
European settlers considered finely ground wheat(en) bread to be the highest standard in this
particular food genre. Wheat was an "old world" grain. Seeds were transplanted and harvested but it took several decades 
before these early plantings yielded enough grain to produce the amount of bread colonial houswives craved. In the meantime,
make-do cooks worked with native crops (maize aka Injun, or Indian, meal) and hardier old world grains that proliferated more quickly (rye). 
Several new kinds of hybrid breads were introduced to the early American diet. Combinations of rye and corn/maize
(aka injun) were not uncommon. Molasses was a cheap substitute for real cane sugar. None of these native ingredients were 
particularly loved. 
<p>
Settlers pushing west were constantly forced to reconcile "old world" recipes with "new world" ingredient realities. Such
was the case in the Ingalls family. Northern American frontier fields readily accomodated rye (a cold weather grain) and
maize (a native grain). In sum: Rye & Injun bread was a product of necessity. Fortunate cooks sometimes able to add 
"old world" ingredients (raisins, spices) to make the bread more palatable. About <a href="foodbreads.html#ryeindian">Rye and Indian bread</a>, with
period recipes.
<p>
"Nowadays we would call this Boston Brown Bread, using all-purpose flour instead of rye, adding raisins, and 'steaming 
instead of slow-oven baking. Its history reaches back to the first New England colonists, whose only grains were the rye they brought
from Europe and the corn they got from the Indians (hence 'injun' for cornmeal). Later wheat flour was added and the name 
'thirded bread' was used for the three grains. How and why the this loaf changed over the years from an unsweetened yeast
bread to a soda bread heavy with molasses we do not know, but it happened before Mother Wilder raised her family."

<a name="brioche">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Brioche</b></font><br>
Brioche is complicated because the term represents both base dough and finished product. Print references exist from 
Medieval times forward. The ingredients and their proportions varied according to place and period. 
Applications and finished products are interesting and unique. So are the historic references. The original reference to Marie Antoinette's famous 
quote <a href="foodbreads.html#mariebrioche">"Let them eat cake"</a> was for brioche. The expression 
<a href="foodbreads.html#makebrioche">"To make a brioche"</a> has nothing to do with baking. 
<p>
<b>What exactly is brioche?</b><br>
"Brioche--Cake made out of yeast dough, often made in the shape of a circle or a ball surmounted by a head...Until the middle
of the eighteenth century brioches were made in Paris with baker's yeast. Brewer's yeast, which had been in use for a long time
in Poland and Austria, was introduced into Alsace and Lorraine when the court of King Stanislas was transferred to Lunefille. In the
olden days the brioches of Gisors and Gournay, great butter marketing centres, used to be famous."<br>
---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, Prosper Montagne [Crown Publishers:New York] 1961 (p. 178)
<p>
<b>Why call it "brioche?"</b> Theories abound:<br>
"The word brioche originated as a derivative of the verb brier, a northern dialect variant of Old
French broyer,  'knead'; this was a Germanic loanword, related to Old High German brehhan,
 break'."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 43)
<p>
"The name of this cake, according to some etymologists, is derived from two old words bris (break) and hocher (stir) which put 
together have resulted in the word brioche. This etymological explanation, which appears to be a little whimsical, is today
generally accepted. Some authors maintain, however, that the word comes from Brie, the name of a district of France famous for
its manufacture of an excellent cheese, where it is said, this cake was invented. According to these authors, the brioche pastry
was originally made with Brie cheese."<br>
---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, Prosper Montagne [Crown Publishers:New York] 1961 (p. 178)
<p>
"We know that butter did not become popular until comparatively late...the Francs used it more than did the Gauls, and the 
latter more than the Romans; but its range was extremely limited. Fats were animal fats which were easy to preserve and convenient
to use. The first pastries therefore combined flour, eggs, honey and lard, and very soon after, cheese. We know that brioche was
originally a pastry made with Brie cheese."<br>

<b>[1828] Brioche paste</b><br>
Take fifteen good fresh eggs, four pounds of very dry flour, and two pounds of fresh butter. Lay
the flour on the table after you have sifted it. Divide it into four equal parts, take one of them to
make the levian; make a hole in the centre, and use some yeast that has been well washed., What
we call wshing the yeast, is pouring some water over it, stirring it, and then letting it stand still.
When all the dregs are at the bottom of the vessel, you throw away all the water that is on the top,
and take about a large table-spoonful of the sediment which you put into the fourth part of the
flour. Then take some hot water, pour it gently over the yeast, and mix the paste directly, in order
to avail yourself of its strength. Do not make it too liquid; powder some flour in a little stew-pan,
put the yeast paste [what we call levain] into the pan, make slight slits over the paste: cover the
pan, and lay it before the fire; a quarter of an hour after, see whether the yeast has risen; if it has
swelled, dilute the brioche directly in the following manner:<p>
Make a great hole in the remaining three fourths of the flour, put four small pinches of salt on as
many different places, with a good pinch of sugar to correct the bitter taste of the yeast, and a
little water to melt the salt. Then take two pounds of butter, which you break into small pieces
with your hand, and put in the middle of the flour: next break the eggs, and smell them
successively to ascertain if they are good: mix the whole well together, and then faisez the paste
as follows; spread it lengthways on the edge of the table, then with the palms of both hands, press
upon it, pushing it by degrees towards the middle of the table; when you have thus worked the
whole of the paste, bring it back again towards the edge, and fraisez it a second time, again bring
it near the edge of the table, andpour it back again towards the edge of the table, and pour the
yeast paste all over it; next divide the whole into small pieces, which you shift from one place to
another; this operation is to mix the yeast with the paste properly. Now fraisez the paste well
again twice, and gather the whole up together. Take a large sieve or an earthen pan, in which
spread a towel, powder a little flour over the towel, put the paste on it, and cover it with the
towel. In simmer time remove the paste to a cool place, and in the winter to a warm one. Observe
that the paste is better when made on the preceding day, and take care to break the paste several
times before you use it; then cut it into equal pieces, and shape them with the palms of your
hands; lay these on the less even size; shape off small balls which you turn also with your palms,
bursh them over with a beaten egg, then make a little hollow, put the small ball into it, brush twice
over with the egg, and bake it in a hot oven. Ifc you wish to make a large brioche, you must make
a very large round well-bittered paper-case; and them mould your paste accordingly. Make a head
the same as for the small one, and bake in a hot oven, but not so hot as is used for the small ones,
for the larger the articles on the pastries are, the less must be the heat of the oven. The borders of
the brioche, or pies, &c. Would burn before the middle part could hardly be heated. When you
perceive that the brioche has colour enough, if it should not be thoroughly baked, cover it with
paper without losing sight of the colour. This same paste may serve to make all sorts of little
<i>entrements</I>, such as <i>Les petites nattes en gateaux de Nanterre; Les petits pains
sucres</i>. The only difference is, that you must put some coarse sugar over these, and
sometimes currants inside.<p>
If you make them of different shapes, you give them different names, and by this means you make
a multiplicity of <i>entrements</i>; however, you have already a sufficient number of them at
your disposal, without introducing many sorts of brioches, as they are too nourishing after dinner;
but they are very good for balls and routs. It is easy to make a great number of different dishes
with the brioche paste, by giving it different forms, and employing different means for the top;
sometimes use the <i>dorure</i>, sometimes use the white of egg, and sometimes coarse sugar
spread over without colour; put patper over them to prevent them from taking too much colour.
Sometimes you may use milk alone to colour it, sometimes the same paste. When you have given
several forms to the paste, and intend to give them several names, you may likewise change the
flavour by using a little saffron dissolved in a glass of <i>malaga</I> and sugar: make some of
one sort, with half of this paste, and with the remainder add a few black currants, and give to
these a different form still; by these means you will obtain a multiplicity of cakes, having all the
same originals, but possessing different flavours, and different appearances."<br>

Carey, Lea and Carey, Philadelphia [Arco Publishing Company:New York] 1978 (p. 403-5)
<p>
<b>[1869] Brioche</b><br>
"Take 1 lb. of sifted flour; put a fourth part of it on the paste-board to make the sponge; make a
hollow in the centre of the flour, and put in it 1/2 oz. of German yeast dissolved in 1/2 gill of
warm water; mix as for puff paste, but rather softer; When the paste is made, gather it in a lump,
and put it to rise in a warm place, in a covered stewpan, with a little warm water in it; take the
remaining three parts of flour; make a hollow in the centre; then add:<br>
1 pinch of salt,<br>
1/2 oz. of sugar,<br>
2 tablespoonfuls of water, to melt the sugar and salt,<br>
10 oz. of butter,<br>
4 eggs;<br>
Mix the paste lightly; then add another egg; mix again, adding another egg, till 7 eggs in all have
been used in the paste,--which must be neither too soft, nor too hard. When the sponge has risen
to twice its original size, mix it lightly with the paste, and put the whole in a basin, in a warm
place, for four hours; after which, put it on the board; roll and fold it, over and over again; put it
back int he basin, to rise again, for two hours; and repeat the folding and pressing down; then put the paste in a very cold place, for two hours. After that time, form into a round lump, and put it
on to a baking-sheet; make a hole in the centre, and pull out the the paste till it forms a ring 12
inches in diameter; let it rest; egg it well with the paste brush; then make an incision all round the
inside of the ring, and open it well, to prevent its closing; put in a brisk oven for half an hour. I
advise giving the brioche this shape, as it will make it easier to bake; it can, however, be made up
into loaves, rolls, buns, or any fancy shape."<br>

<b>[1903] 4314 Brioche Paste</b><br>
"Ingredients: 500g (1 lb 2 oz) sifted flour, 250g (9 oz) butter, 6 eggs, 12g (1/2 oz) yeast, 15g (1/2
oz) salt, 25g (1 oz) sugar, 1 dl (3 1/2 fl oz or 1/2 U.S. cup) lukewarm water.<br>
Method:<br>
1. Take a quarter of the flour and make a well in the centre; place in the yeast and dissolve it with
a little of the water. Add a little more water, mix into the flour and make it into a soft paste. Roll
in a ball, cut a cross on top, cover and allow to prove in a warm place until doubled in size.<br>
2. Make a well in the remainder of the flour, place 2 tbs lukewarm water or milk and 4 of the eggs
in it and mix to a dough kneading and beating it vigorously on the table. Add the other eggs one
at a time continuing to knead the paste well. When it is very smooth and elastic add the salt and
sugar dissolved in a little water, then spread on top the butter, softened to the same texture as the
paste; knead small portions of the paste and butter together and successively, then gradually
reassemble the whole together.<br>
3. At this stage place the first dough which would be doubled in size on top of this paste and mix
in small amounts at a time until all is amalgamated. Place the paste in a basin, cover with a cloth
and keep in a fairly cool place to prove for 12 hours. After 5 or 6 hours arrest the fermentation of
the paste by beating it with the palm of the hand then allow it to prove again for the remaining
time.<br>
<i>Note:</i><br>
1. By increasing the amount of butter a finer paste can be obtained; up to 500 g (1 lb 2 oz) may be
used but usually 400g (14 oz) is sufficient.<br>
2. The more butter there is in a brioche paste the less it must be kneaded.<br>
3. This paste is used for certain fruit timbales. In this case it is placed to prove in a tall Charlotte
mould and cooked in the same mould."<br>

<b>"Let them eat cake!"</b><br>
Food historians confirm the composition of brioche evolved over time. The <a href="foodbreads.html#brioche">brioche</a> referenced
by Marie Antoinette in her infamous proclamation "Let them eat cake" ("Qu'ils manget de la brioche") 
was probably not the same food we enjoy today.  
<p>
"Brioches originated as soft and light white loaves, enriched with butter and eggs, much much less
so than those we know today. They were baked without moulds. Looking at Chardin's beautiful
paintings of brioches you can see that he has quite clearly defined the notches round the base of
his cottage-loaf-shaped confections, which are handsome and tall but not tidy like a moulded
cake. So I think that in the eighteenth century, and at the time of that poor, foolish Marie
Antoinette is supposed to have said, when told that the people of Paris were rioting for bread,
  qu'ils manget de al brioche', the composition of the cake must have been simply that of an
enriched bread much like that of our own Bath buns and Sally Lunns, so made at that period
without benefit of moulds or tins, although paper bands were sometimes wrapped round them for
baking. Certainly it would not be possible to bake today's liquid brioche mixture or crust for a
fillet of beef or a large sausage then the brioche mixture is made with fewer eggs and less butter,
or it would be impossible to handle."<br>
---<i>English Bread and Yeast Cookery</i>, Elizabeth David [Penguin:Middlesex] 1977 (p.
497)
<p>

"'Quils mangent de la brioche' (usually translated into
English as "let them eat cake"), the statement attributed to Marie Antoinette on being told that the
people of Paris were rioting because they had no bread, has achieved more notoriety than it
deserves. Eighteenth-century brioche was only lightly enriched (by modest quantities of butter and
eggs) and not very far removed from a good white loaf of bread."<br>

<b>What does it mean when someone "makes a brioche?"</b><br>
"To Make A Brioche--'Faire une brioche' means to make a blunder or bloomer, 'to drop a brick'. This is how the expression 
originated: After the foundation of the Paris Opera (which goes almost as far back as the invention of the brioche) the musicians
of the orchestra had the idea of punishing any member of the orchestra who was guilty of playing out of tune by making him pay a 
fine. The total sum of the fines collected was spent on brioches which were eaten by all the members at a gathering for which a date was
fixed. The musicians who were thus fined had to wear a badge representing a brioche in their button holes. These facts soon became
known to the general public and thus the expression 'to make a brioche' passed into general speech when one wanted to say that someone
had acted foolishly or made a silly mistake."<br>

Campaillou is a contemporary artisan French sourdough bread composed in the rustic style. The concept is ancient; the modern product is a brilliant marketing coup. 
Back to (delicious!) basics. Campaillou is generally is described as "light rye sourdough." About <a href="foodbreads.html#sourdough">sourdough</a>.
Although Campaillou's concept is ancient, the earliest print references we find to breads with this name are from the early 1990s. This coincides with the birth of the
 <a href="foodbreads.html#artisan">artisan</a> (aka artisanal) bread movement. We find no references to Campaillou in <i>Larousse Gastronomique</i> (1938, 1961, 2001), Julia Child's
 cookbooks,

<b>Campaillou in the news:</b><br>
""Maison Blanc started 10 years ago because we couldn't find decent French bread anywhere in Britain and we needed it for the restaurant," says Jenny Blanc, who
 was then partner with her former husband, the chef Raymond Blanc. "When we started, there wasn't a part-baked frozen or ready-to-cook petit pain in the shops 
and supermarkets didn't even sell croissants. Now you can buy them anywhere, albeit many are frightful. "Opening the bakery was something of a landmark. It 
became so successful because it was the first real taste in Britain of a genuine French product." Until then, "French" loaves in Britain had been made with English or
 Canadian flour by British bakers. The Blancs set out to import French flour. They could then offer authentic French bread made with French flour by French 
bakers. "We still buy from our original suppliers. We were their first customer in the UK, now they have lots more. It wasn't difficult getting them to deliver, but we 
had to take a large consignment, three or four months' supply. Now they've got a depot and an office and everything in this country and we get supplies weekly.
 "Originally we ran the bakery more as a hobby, because our main interest was in the hotel and restaurant. Then, about two years ago, when the business was 
divided, I decided to develop it because there is now such a demand for speciality breads."..."Baguettes are still our best sellers. In addition, everyone is looking for
 something that says health and quality and looks rustic. The traditional French flours we use don't contain any additives." It is only the flours for the English breads
 made at Maison Blanc that contain any improvers.Four bakers, under chef boulanger Olivier Bileau, make the 42 different types of loaves and rolls produced in the
 bakery every night. They start work at about 7pm to make the bread doughs, prove, shape and then bake the loaves in one of three ovens. The speciality French
 breads go into either a rack oven or a flat oven and the English tin and cob loaves in a standard baker's oven. The doughs are mixed by machine but every French
 loaf, except the baguettes, is shaped by hand. A loaf from Maison Blanc takes about five hours to make. The paysan, cereale, Parisien, campagne, campailloum
 seigle, tournesol, bavarois rye, pain de son, pain a l'oignon, country grain, marbre and various pains aux raisins and olives are more-or-less round or oval. The pain aux noix has a curious flat top, made by rolling a flat edge from the basic round and folding it back over the loaf. The tresse is a dextrously executed plait dressed with poppy seeds and the meule couronne a crown-shaped baguette. The rolls are in different shapes, including the Maison's mini Oxfordian which started life in the shape of a mortarboard but has now evolved into a plump roll with a cross cut in the top. There is also a hybrid flat ciabatta made with French flour but light golden, less floury than many and delicious. The baguettes - batard, couronne, Parisien, tresse - are made with meule flour, a coarsely stoneground unbleached white flour from the Beauce region. Cereale is a mix of four flours: rye, barley, oats and rice plus wheatgerm and rye. Campagne is a light white bread; marbre a marbled mix of doughs from rye and campagne flours; country grain contains rye, oats, rice, wheat, maize and buckwheat flours and sesame and sunflower seeds. Campaillou contains some sourdough starter along with the yeast and is crusty and moist. Tournesol is a wheat and rye flour with sunflower seeds; pain de son has added bran and is covered in crushed bran. "We've always had a core of French bakers, but we have had one or two good English bakers who have picked up the French techniques very well. Patisserie is another matter. It is many years of training, more difficult and all our patissiers are French," says Jenny Blanc. She has a cordon bleu training. "I spent several years cooking in my parents' hotel, the Rose Revived at Newbridge, a lovely little Cotswold hotel and restaurant on the river. But my experience is really on the business side and I don't cook now."---"Boom-time catering to the upper crust - Maison Blanc.

"Brakes has turned to traditional breadmaking methods to produce its new range of part-baked Artisan Breads aimed at providing a premium bread offering for 
operators wanting to add variety, quality and a point of difference without the hassle or skill involved in making it from scratch. The breads are made using natural 
and premium ingredients such as spelt, Campaillou and Camp Remy flours. Some are bulk-fermented for up to eight hours, a process which reduces the need for
 yeast and allows the flavours to develop and spread throughout the dough. The dough is then stone-baked, which gives the bread a strong crust and unique
 appearance. Those launched under the Real French brand are made in France from wheat grown a minimum of half-a-mile from any roads."<br>

<a name="bruschetta">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Bruschetta & garlic bread</b></font><br>
Food historians confirm Mediterranean peoples have been dipping bread in spiced oil for thousands of years. 
Combinations, recipes, meal function and toppings varied according to time and taste. <a href="foodfaq1.html#garlic">Garlic</a>
is one of the few "constants."
Bruschetta, as we know it today, is an Italian combination originating in the Tuscany 
region. The tomato topped starter we American enjoy today is a recent iteration.
American-style <a href="http://foodtimeline.org/garlicbread">garlic bread</a> also descends from this tradition. 
 Food historians offer two theories regarding the original purpose of bruschetta:
<p>

"Bruschetta, A Tuscan dish designed to show off the new season's oil at the time of the olive
harvest. "<br>
---<l>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
110)
<p>
"Bruschetta. The now ubituitous garlic bread is a lineal if somewhat debased version of the Italian
bruschetta. This is a slice of bread toasted brown on each side and then moistened with a
generous dribble
of olive oil (it can also be rugged with garlic, but this is optional). Its name reflects its original
cooking
method: it is a derivative of the Italian verb bruscare,  roast over coals'."<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2003 (p.
44)
<p>
"Bruschetta. Toasted bread, often rubbed with garlic and drizzled with olive oil. Also
schiena d'asino, soma d'aj in the south, and fettunta in Tuscany. Bruschetta has always
been a way to salvage bread that was going stale by adding oil and seasonings.
Sometimes the bread is entirely immersed in oil, but usually the oil is poured on the top
after the bread is rubbed with a garlic clove. In recent years adding toppings,
particularly chopped onions and tomatoes, has become popular in restaurants."<br>

<b>American-style garlic bread</b><br>
Garlic bread, as most Americans know it today, descends from ancient Mediterranean
<a href="foodbreads.html#bruschetta">bruschetta</a>. The Americanized version typically substitutes butter for oil, garlic
powder/salt for fresh product and commercial oregano. It may, or may not, also include some kind of "Italian" cheese
(Romano, Parmesean) in either fresh grated or commercial powdered form. American-style garlic bread is prepared with 
long crusty loaves ("Italian" or "French" bread). Bread is sliced vertical or horizontal; butter/spice/cheese mixture is
spread, then wrapped in foil and warmed in the oven. Frozen and pre-made garlic bread products may be found
in most supermarkets. <a href="http://foodtimeline.org/garlicknots">Garlic knots</a> first surface in the 1980s.
<p>
"The relationship between bruschetta and "garlic bread" is a peculiar one. In principle, bruschetta
is the honest, poor man's original -nothing but charred, oil-soaked bread rubbed with garlic-while
"garlic bread" is the embellished pretender. But somehow things have got mixed up. British
democracy has confused them. Garlic bread became genuinely democratised, sold in dispiriting
packs of two, or even four, for 99p in the brightest freezer cabinets. Meanwhile, the monied
torchbearers of democracy - in fact, the elite - went crazy for bruschetta, paying a small fortune
for pane covered in broad beans or anchovies at the River Cafe. And so, bizarrely, buttery
indigestible garlic bread has come to seem unpretentious "people's food", while bruschetta is the
poncy snack of the People's Party. This is an unfortunate state of affairs. Everything that is best
about bruschetta -- its power to bestow well-being in one crisp bite -- is betrayed by garlic bread.
To begin with, as Marcella Hazan points out: "The most important ingredient in bruschetta is not
garlic but olive oil." The garlic on bruschetta is rubbed on, so that you inhale the fresh garlic
perfume as a backdrop to the olive oil, rather than eating great lumps of it. The origin of
bruschetta was probably the ancient Roman practice of tasting newly pressed olive oil on a piece
of bread, with or without garlic -- a practice that has continued in the oil-producing areas of
Tuscany, Umbria and Lazio. The name derives from bruscare, meaning "to roast over coals".
Alice Waters's version of bruschetta involves frying country bread in large amounts of oil, until
thoroughly impregnated, and Elizabeth David recommends baking slices of white bread in the
oven."<br>

<b>Garlic knots</b><br>
These tasty morsels combine the flavor classic
 <a href="foodbreads.html#bruschetta">bruschetta</a> with the convenience of modern <a href="foodbreads.html#garlic bread">garlic bread</a>. While the
product is simple, and could have been enjoyed for thousands of years, print references first surface in the late
1980s.

"SIMPLE ingredients - flour, water, yeast. It's how the cook treats these elements that determines whether French baguettes or pita bread will make an appearance on the
 dinner table. But if your name is Frank Zitoli, rest assured that the bread basket will include garlic knots, tiny morsels of bread tossed with olive oil, lots of fresh garlic and
 grated Romano cheese. In a word - irresistible. "My Uncle Mike first introduced me to them,"said Zitoli, referring to Michael Prudente, co-owner of Prudente's restaurant in 
Island Park. Prudente's garlic knots were a slightly different shape, said Zitoli "but when he asked me what I thought of them, I told him they were great." Zitoli loved garlic 
knots, but would the public? At the time, he owned Pizza Delight in Plainview. "I put a bowl of them on the counter and offered them free to customers. I waited for their 
reaction. As soon as a person would pop one into his mouth, his eyes would light up and a smile would come to his face." That was 10 years ago, and he sold thousands
 at 10 cents a piece. But Zitoli didn't stop there. He splits garlic knots and stuffs them with provolone, prosciutto or sausage. He stuffs the dough with slivers of cheese
 before baking, adds whole-wheat flour, substitutes semolina. For champagne parties at his restaurant, Franina, in Syosset, Zitoli tucks in smoked tuna and smoked
 salmon. He has gone as far as presenting filled garlic knots in the shape of wreaths and Christmas trees. "I feel they are a success because I fuss with the details," he 
said. "I hire part-time people who do nothing but peel garlic, and the cheese is grated here." Why Romano cheese? "It brings out the flavor of the garlic," he said. Will
 garlic knots catch on? Are they the garlic bread of tomorrow? Danny Horton, owner of Victor's Pizza Delight in South Huntington, learned to make garlic knots from the 
former owners, Zitoli's sister and brother-in-law. At Victor's you can still buy them for a dime apiece or eat them with the daily specials - lasagna, chicken parmesan, ziti.
 "During a busy day, we can make as many as 1,500 garlic knots," said Horton. Across Route 110 and down the road at Francesco's Pizzeria, owner Michael Macchia
 said he believes they're popular because "People love garlic." A regular customer who was waiting for two pizzas to come out of the oven said she picks up garlic knots
 when she buys pizza and leaves them in the refrigerator as snacks for her children after school. "A few seconds in the microwave makes them taste freshly baked," she
 said, "and it makes a good alternative to a sugar snack." Macchia charges 15 cents each for garlic knots. "They take a lot of time to make because they're formed by 
hand," he said. <br>

Franina in Syosset more than a decade ago. They are still there, piping hot, peeking out from the impressive bread baskets. And, they are just as compelling and 
addictive as ever. Bread may be a constant here, but there have been changes. Years ago, Franina, a modest storefront in a strip shopping center that includes a 
doughnut shop and a cleaners, was a casual cafe. Today it is plush inside, despite its still simple exterior."<br>

 bread knots by hand using a family recipe. "Our family has created these handmade knots for three generations," Ventrano says. The tradition continues today at Papa

<a name="challah">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Challah</b></font><br>

"There are two words for bread in Hebrew: lechem and challah. Lechem is the everyday
bread...Challah is
the special, usually white egg bread reserved for the Sabbath. Challah is also the word that refers
to the
portion of dough set apart for the high priests in the Temple of Jerusalem. One of the three
commandments incumbent upon women, "taking challah," evolved sometime following the
destruction of
the Temple by the Romans in 70 C.E. Following the rising of the dough, women would separate a
piece
and burn it to remind them of the offerings to the Temple. For nearly two millennia it has
symbolically
replaced the sacrificial offerings. All challah that is baked today is kosher only if "challah has been
taken."...It was the Eastern European immigrants who put challah on the gastronomical map in
the country.
In biblical times...Sabbath bread was probably more like our present-day pita. Through the ages
and as
Jews moved to different lands the loaves varied. But only in America could Jews eat
challah...every day of
the week...Elsewhere a round challan at Rosh Hashanah became a symbol of life. Usually the
Rosh
Hashanah bread is formed in a circle, to signify the desire for a long life. At this point, local
traditions
diverge. Some people add saffron and raisins to make the bread just a little bit more special than a
typical
Friday-night load. In certain towns of Russia, the round challah was imprinted with the shape of a
ladder on
top, to symbolize the ascent to God on high...Many challot traditions were lost as a result of the
Holocaust
or because of Soviet religious suppression..."<br>
---<i>Jewish Cooking In America</i>, Joan Nathan [Knopf:New York] 1998 (p. 72-3)<br>
[NOTE: This book contains more information and several recipes. Ask your librarian to help you

<p>
"Challa...Pronounce Khal-leh, with a rattling kh. Thyme with "a doll a." Hebrew: challah. A
braided loaf of
white bread, glazed with egg white, very soft, delicate in flavor...Challa is a Sabbath and holiday
delicacy.
For Shabbes it is always made in a braided form. On holidays it may be kneaded into other shapes:
circular,
ladderlike, etc...Two challas, uncut, are on the table of observing Jews on Sabbath eve; thy are
not cut until
after the broche (blessing). This practice perpetuates the memory of the Temple, where two rows
of bread
were lined up before the altar. The home, which is of limitless importance in Jewish life, is in fact
called in
Hebrew "migdash mehad"--or "a small temple." When a challah (or any Sabbath bread) is baked,
a small
piece of dough is, by tradition, tossed into the oven or fire--as a token of sacrifice. Why? Because
challa is a
Hebrew term used in Numbers 15:20 and Ezekiel 44:30, where it means "the priest's share" of the
baking
dough."<br>
---<i>The Joys of Yiddish</i>, Leo Rosten [McGraw Hill:New York] 1968 (p. 68-9)
<p>
"Hallah. A form of bread (II Sam. 6:19). The term also applies to the portion of dough set aside
and given to
the priest (Num. 15:19-20). The etymology of the word is traced either to the Hebrew root for
"hollow" and
"pierce"...suggesting a perforated and/or rounded loaf, of to the Akkadian "ellu" ("oure"),
referring to the
bread's sacral use. Until new evidence allows more precision...hallah must be rendered "loaf"
(parallel to
the Hebrew word kikkar). In the Bible, hallah is a bread offering subsumed under minhah, the
grain
sacrifice. Commonly used in an unleavened form, and only rarely in a leavened form (Lev. 7:13;
probably
Num. 15:20), the bread is made with or without oil (Ex. 29:2, 23...)...
     Post Bibilical. According to the rabbis, the precept of setting aside hallah applies to dough
kneaded from
one of the five species og grain (Hal. 1:1), since only from them can the bread (referred to in
Num. 15:19)
"when you eat of the bread of the land" etc.) be made, although Philo ...limits to wheat and barley
alone....The quantity of dough from which hallah must be taken is not explicitly stated in the
<i>Bible</i>,
and Shammai and Hillel already differed on the quantity...In later generations...the quanitity was
fixed,
based on the worlds "Of the first of your dough," which was taken to mean "as much as your
dough was,"
viz, "the dough of the wilderness." How much was this? It is written (Ex. 16:36)...Hallah is one of
the 24
perquesites of the priest (cf Ezek. 44:30)...Hallah must be eaten by priests in a state of ritual
purity; the
commoner who eats it deliberately is liable to the penalty of "keret"...The word "hallah" is
popularly
employed for the special Sabbath loaves."<br>

We've been asked about cheese sticks (cheese straws) before. The origin/evolution/history of this delicious item is relatively easy to trace. The reason it's *mandatory* for Alabama functions is more challenging to capture in print. In sum: our food history & southern USA cookbooks generally agree cheese straws are popular, but they don't say why. Presumably, the reason is *obvious* to folks who know. The rest of us are left in the dark. 
<p>
We do know the southern states of America have a special love for all things cheese. Chess Pie, cheese straws, cheddar biscuits &c. are traditional fare. Straws/sticks/biscuits must be served hot! hot! hot! or not at all. 
<p>
<b>About cheese straws (aka cheese sticks)</b><br>
The general consensus regarding traditional Southern cheese straws is that the recipe originated 
in England. It was introduced to the colonies by British cooks. Early recipes indicate this might have been a 
popular way to use up extra puff-paste dough. Food historians trace the origin of <a href="foodpies.html#puffpaste">puff-paste</a>  to 
Renaissance times.
A survey of early cheese straw-type recipes reveals these tasty items were know though time by 
different names. Likewise, there are several recipe variations. One common thread connecting 
these recipes is they were to be sent hot as possible to the table. This holds true today. 
<p>
<b>About Southern USA cheese straws</b><p>
"Cheese straws are made by every good cook throughout the Southern states. They are a staple of 
the cocktail table...and they are superb morsels to nibble upon with bourbon and sherry...The 
straw originally referred to the shape--long and narrow. Most Cheese Straws in the South are 
now round like little biscuits. Cheese Straws came from England and, despite the superb true 
cheddar, often were made solely from Parmesan, which has been imported into England for 
centuries." <br>

Ciabatta is an old bread enjoying a resurgence in popularity among today's gourmets. Like
focaccia, it is a rustic bread that is now featured in many restaurants and bakeries. This crusty
flatbread is said to have originated in Tuscany. Today, ciabatta is often the *bread of choice*
when constructing upscale Italian sandwiches, such as <a href="foodsandwiches.html#panini">panini</a>.
<p>
"Ciabatta
"Slipper," A bread loaf about 8 inches long with a light, thin crust; the shape resembles a
common slipper."<br>
---<i>The Dictionary of Italian Food and Drink</i>, John Mariani [Broadway Books:New York] 1998
(p. 74)
<p>
"Ciabatta is a type of Italian loaf made from a dough that includes olive oil as one of its
ingredients. Its long, flat, vaguely shoe-like shape earned it its name--Italian ciabatta menas
literally 'slipper'. It is a borrowing, via Turkish, of Persian ciabat."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 77)
<p>
"CIABATTA means slipper in Italian. It is also the name of a light and crusty bread from the
Lake Como region in northern Italy. The bread is called ciabatta (pronounced cha-BAH-ta)
because its flattened oval form resembles a well-worn slipper. The crust encloses a simple, rustic
bread with an extremely porous texture, making for an unusually inviting combination of
chewiness and lightness.  "Ciabatta is not an elegant slipper, but the kind of old slipper you
slouch
around in," said Jean Salvadore, who lives at Villa d'Este, a hotel in the town of Como, and who
wrote the hotel's cookbook. "In the Como region, they come in all sizes. I've heard that they are
becoming popular in other parts of Italy but I don't think you'll see them in the south." But if, like
many people from that region of Italy, Mrs. Salvadore considers Florence to be in the south, her
information is out of date. Ciabatta was recently sighted in that city. And in England, of all
places,
ciabatta has become so popular that it is sold in supermarkets.
     And now, ciabatta has made its debut in New York. Sarah Black, who owns a baking
company
called Campanio, is making ciabatta at the Tom Cat Bakery in Long Island City, Queens. Tom
Cat distributes the breads to Dean & DeLuca, Positively 104, Marche Madison and Murray's
Cheese Shop in Manhattan, and Bon Appetit Foods in Princeton, N.J. 
Ms. Black's delicious ciabatta is made in a large domed oval (it would be a slipper only for Big
Foot) instead of the traditional flattened slipper shape. It is richly browned outside and full of
holes within. She has never been to Italy, but said she became intrigued with the bread about a
year ago after reading about it in "The Italian Baker," by Carol Field (Harper & Row, 1985). "I'm
fascinated with breads made with very wet doughs," she said.
     The dough for ciabatta is so wet and sticky that in her book, Mrs. Field warns that it is "utterly
unfamiliar and probably a bit scary." She goes on to say that "the shaped loaves look flat and
definitely unpromising," but urges the baker on, because the recipe produces an excellent result.
Ciabatta, like other old-fashioned country breads with moist, gummy doughs, is slow-rising and
calls for relatively little yeast. Ms. Black is not the only one who has become fascinated with it.
George Balasses, who owns Balasses House Antiques in Amagansett, L.I., and who has been
baking bread for decades, came upon a recipe for ciabatta in The Observer while he was in
London in November. He tried it when he returned home. "My first attempts, following the
recipe
in the paper exactly, fell short of my expectations," he said. "I think the dough was too runny; it
needed some more flour." He experimented a few times and once he felt he had gotten it right,
what especially pleased him was that the dough could be made entirely in a food processor. "It's
not a kneaded bread but it tastes like one," he said. One complaint he had with the recipe was that
the loaf was quite small. "It's not a lot of trouble to make, but if you're going to bother at all you
might as well have something to show for it," he said. Now when he bakes the bread, he
increases
the recipe by half.
     Mr. Balasses added that in England, the bread is usually made in the flattened slipper-shape.
The Observer traced the origin of ciabatta in England to a chain of shops called La Fornaia,
which
it said was started in London in 1985 by an American, Peggy Dannenbaum. Ciabatta is excellent
with some cheese or salami, and it's convenient to split in half horizontally and use for
sandwiches. Mrs. Field's recipe is more complicated than Mr. Balasses', but the finished breads,
four little slippers, have a craggier texture, a crisper crust and a somewhat earthier flavor. The
recipe calls for making a starter or "sponge," a mixture of yeast, flour and water that first must be
allowed to rise. A little more yeast, plus flour, salt, water and olive oil are combined with the
starter to make the dough, which is best mixed in an electric mixer. Instead of merely dumping
the
sticky mass of dough onto a baking sheet, shape the dough into loaves and wait for it to rise
again. Most of the effort in this recipe involves waiting for the dough to rise, not attending to the
ingredients. These are not recipes for people with a microwave mentality. The rising times are
long and slow, a factor that contributes to the flavor of ciabatta. It's the kind of cooking, as in
making a good baked potato or a tender pot roast, that requires the passage of time, but no great
effort, to produce its reward."<br>

Food historians generally agree cinnamon <a href="foodbreads.html#toast">toast</a> descends from a venerable line of ancient 
spiced breads and sweet cakes. When cinnamon was introduced to Europe by returning Crusaders, it became the 
spice of wealthy choice for cakes, pies, breads, puddings and other dishes. English "Pokerounce" was the medieval 
counterpart of today's cinnamon toast. Easier to prepare and digest than 
<a href="foodfaq1.html#frenchtoast">French toast</a> and <a href="foodpuddings.html#bread">bread puddings</a>, these pieces of toasty
 deliciousness were embraced for invalid

<a name="croissants">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Croissants</b></font><br>
The origin of the croissant is one of the great food legends of all time. The <i>Larousse
Gastronomique</i> offers this explanation regarding the origin of the croissant:
<p>
"Croissant...This delicious pastry originated in Budapest in 1686, when the Turks were besieging
the city. To reach the centre of the town, they dug underground passages. Bakers, working during
the night, heard the noise made by the Turks and gave the alarm. The assailants were repulsed and
the bakers who had saved the city were granted the privilege of making a special pastry which had
to take the form of a crescent in memory of the emblem on the Ottoman flag."<br>
---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, Jenifer Harvey Lang, editor [Crown:New York] 1988  (p.
338)
<p>
It's an interesting story. Is it true? Alan Davidson, noted food historian, expresses his doubts:<br>
"Culinary mythology--origin of the croissant<br>
According to one of a group of similar legends, which vary only in detail, a baker of the 17th
century, working through the night at a time when his city (either Vienna in 1683 or Budapest in
1686) was under siege by the Turks, heard faint underground rumbling sounds which, on
investigation, proved to be caused by a Turkish attempt to invade the city by tunnelling under the
walls. The tunnel was blown up. The baker asked no reward other than the exclusive right to bake
crescent-shaped pastries commemorating the incident, the crescent being the sympol of Islam. He
was duly rewarded in this way, and the croissant was born.
     The story seems to owe its origin, or at least its wide diffusion, to Alfred Gottschalk, who
wrote about the croissant for the first edition of the <i>Larousse Gastronomique</i> [1938] and
there
gave the legend in the Turkish attack on Budapest in 1686 version; but on the history of food,
opted for the 'siege of Vienna in 1683' version."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999
(p. 232)
<p>
While the history of pastry dates back to ancient times, the history of the croissant [as we know it
today], seems to be a relatively new invention. Part of the problem may be how one defines
"croissant." Food history sources confirm that crescent-shaped pastries were baked in Vienna
during the 17th century and that they migrated to France soon thereafter. They recount, but do
not confirm/deny the story of the brave bakers who supposedly created the first croissants.  This
is what Mr. Davidson has to say:
<p>
"...croissant in its present form does not have a long history...The earliest French reference to the
croissant seems to be in Payen's book "Des substances alimentaires," published in 1853. He cites,
among the "Pains dit de fantasie ou de luxe," not only English 'muffins' but  'les croissants'. The
term appears again, ten years later, in the great Littre dictionary [1863] where it is defined as 'a
little crescent-shaped bread or cake'. Thirteen years later, Husson in "Les Consommations de
Paris" [1875] includes 'croissants for coffee' in a list of 'ordinary' (as opposed to 'fine') pastry
goods. Yet no trace of a recipe for croissants can be found earlier than that given by Favre in his
<i>Dictionnaire universel de cuisine</i> [c. 1905], and his recipe bears no resemblance to the
modern
puff pastry concoction; it is rather an oriental pastry made of pounded almonds and sugar. Only in
1906, in Colombie's <i>Nouvelle Encyclopedie culinaire</i>, did a true croissant, and its
development
into a national symbol of France, is a 20th-century history."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i> (p. 228)
<p> 
Chef Jim Chevallier, who has conducted extensive research on the history of the croissant, concurs the origins
recounted in most texts are truly "colorful tales." Chef Chevallier's research focuses on the connection between the French
Croissant and the Viennese Kipfel. In doing so, he pushes back the date for this particular breadstuff [in Vienna] to 1630.
He credits August Zang, a Viennese baker, for introducing this item to Paris in the late 1830s. If you would like more 
details we recommend Chef Chevallier's book: 
<i>August Zang and the French Croissant: How Viennoiserie Came to France</i>.
<p>
<a name="marie">
<b>Marie Antoinette's croissants?</b><br>
Chef Chevallier addresses this as well. In sum: much of what we "know" about food history belongs to the realm of "fakelore" or
"food mythology." If a "fact" is published widely it somehow becomes "true." Marie Antoinette ('Let them eat cake')
 and Catherine de Medici (forks!) are
two famous people regularly misquoted/misapppropriated historically in the food world. Completely understandable, given their 
actual stature/stance in history. 
<p>
"The Austrian-born Marie-Antoinette was perhaps France's most elegant and glamorous queen, and the oft-repeated idea that she introduced
France's most elegant breakfast food has sufficeint poetry to have endured. If, after all, one accepts the idea that Austrian
bakers had only a century before invented the ancestor of the croissant, it is but a short step to imagine that this 
Austrian princess then brought it to France...But the claim only appears well after the eighteenth century, despite the fact that
French queens in general, and Marie-Antoinette in particular, were closely watched and chronicled. Had Marie-Antoinette brought 
any food into fashion the fact would have been widely mentioned in the gossip sheets of the time. Yet the closest thing to a
period reference for this tale is a tantalizing note by her maid...that the Queen had a particular prefernece for  'a sort
of bread she was used to having since her childhood in Vienna.' Also, a list from 1780 of those serving the Queen includes a German
cook...It is not impossible that the latter provided a kipfel, or perhaps a pain viennois for the Queen's breakfast, but if so,
her consumption of it appears to have had no wider influcence. It is always problematic to demonstrate the absence of 
reference, and in this case, all that can be said for the most part is that neither kipfel nor any baked good closely 
associated with Marie Antoinette is mentioned in the more common sources of life in that period...At the mid-point of the 
nineteenth century, references to the croissant began to appear in France."<br>

<a name="croutons">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Croutons</b></font><br>

Thrifty cooks have been finding creative ways for using up stale bread since the beginning of time. The connection
between stale bread and soup dates to the Medieval times, when soup was served in sops (pieces of stale bread). French 
onion soup is classically topped with a <a href="foodsoups.html#frenchonionsoup">crust of stale bread</a>
<p>
Croutons, purposely spiced and gently toasted, are more refined twist on this culinary theme. One might reasonably argue croutons 
were inspired by <a href="foodcookies.html#biscotti"> biscotti</a> and other ancient twice baked goods.
<p>
"Crouton. Derived from the French crouton, has been an English word since early in the 19th century, whereas two
other connected French culinary terms, croute and croustade, have remained French...All these terms derive from the
Latin word crusta, meaning 'shell'. Thus the outside of a loaf of bread is the crust or croute. Crouton, the diminutive
form, usually refers to the familiar little cubes of toasted or fried bread which might originally have been cut from a
crust...It first appears in French in the 17th century when it is described as 'a little piece of bread crust served with
drinks'. In recent times, croutons are often added to fish soups, and occasionally to certain salads." <br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 229) 
<p>
"Croutes for soup. Thick slices of French bread (flute) which have been partly hollowed out or cut in two lengthways
and dried in the oven. Croutes are served with all kinds of soups, usually separately, either plain, garnished or

The origin & evolution of Hollywood (brand) Bread makes for a good story. Not sure if any of it can be substantiated. In 1969 a 
syndicated article profiling <a href="foodbreads.html#1969">Eleanor Hansberry's life</a> was published nationwide. In it, the ingredients (but not the 
proportions or cooking directions) for Hollywood Bread are revealed. This was three years after the Federal Trade 
Commission ruled the company was misleading consumers with low-calorie claims. We find no evidence Ms. Hansberry had 
any kind of culinary/nutrition/home economics experience or training, which makes her story sketchy. Nor do we find
 evidence she patented her formula.

bread and commercial white bread. The only reason a slice of the bread contains fewer calories is that it is thinner. The commission said the concern's advertisements 
'definitely create the impression that Hollywood Bread is specialy concocted by a formula which results in a bread of lower calorie content,' when in fact the 
'only way' a consumer can reduce with bread is to eat less of it. By not informing the consumer of this 'unvarying fact,' the concern is being deceptive in its advertising, 
Chairman Dixon said....National licenses more than 180 bakeries to produce its trademarked bread. These licensees pay National a fee of one or more cents a

artichoke, lettuce and pumpkin. To this, she added a smidge of seaweed. 'That,' she said, 'is five percent of the loaf. The rest is flour, honey, skim milk, molasses, malt, no sugar and 
no shortening. Go ahead. Bake it.' She waited. And tasted. It had good flavor. The average one pound loaf of bread runs between 64 and 80 calories per slice. Eleanor's

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Irish soda bread</b></font><br>
Irish soda bread, as we know it today, surfaces in the mid-19th century, when bicarbonate of soda
was first used as a leavening agent. Prior to this time, similar breads and raised cakes were made with sourdough
and barm brack, <a href="foodbreads.html#yeasthistory">yeast</a> created by fermenting ale. About <a
href="foodfaq.html#bakingpowder"> leavening agents</a>. Traditional Irish Soda Bread comes in three varieties:
white, brown and fly (with raisins or currants). The bread is cut into farls, four equal parts, to promote even baking on hot
girdles. 
<p>
"One of the oldest of all leavens is the sourdough method, and like many great discoveries it
probably came about by accident. An old fable describes what happened. Long ago in the "stone
age" when a woman made bread by the simple expedient of mixing ground corn and water
together and baking the dough on hot stones or in the fire, a gound girl had just put down a loaf
to bake when her lover invited her to go on a hunting trip. Off she sped, leaving the mixing bowl
unwashed. When next she went to mix a cake in the bowl, a lump of sour fermented dough from
the last baking was mixed in with the new dough. The result, of course, was delicious spongy
bread which gained her the reputation of being the best bread-maker in Ireland, to her immense
satisfaction. Even her lover had to admit that she was a better cook than his mother. Barm beer or
liquid yeast obtained from beer-brewing was used from early times. Sowans (fermented juice of
oat husks) was another traditional leaven, as was potato juice (potatoes grated and the juice
allowed to turn sour). Bread soda, which would act not only as a leavening agent, but create the
traditional soda bread, did not come into use until the first half of the 19th century. Cream of
tartar and commercial baking powders continue to be used down to the present time."<br>

"Soda Breads. Quickly made breads, griddle cakes and scones with bicarbonate of soda and cream
of tartar or tartaric acid became popular in Ireland, Scotland and England well over a hundred
years ago. The properties of chemical raising agents had been appreciated early in the nineteenth
century, and experiments with commercially practical formulas had been successful during the
1850s, and earlier...At first, chemical mixes seem to have been used mainly to lighten home-made
biscuits, girdle scones, oatcakes, and other bakestone products which had previously been made
without any benefit of any aerating agen. It was only later, after they had been much advertised as
 yeast powder,  dried yeast,  yeast substitute, that housewives began to think that chemical
mixtures could...replace fresh yeast in their tea cake, spice cake and bread recipes...At that period,
German or compressed yeast, much like the bakers yeast we know today, was increasingly
replacing the old ale yeasts and barms, as was very generally known, although incorrectly, as dried
yeast...It is try that well-made Irish soda bread, baked over a peat fire and with meal ground from
soft Irish wheat unblended with imported high gluten grain, is unsurpassed for flavour. The
drawback with these breads, even when made in ideal conditions, is that they quickly become
dry, so are only at their best when freshly baked..."<br>

"When an article of food has become part of the national diet it is more often than not an honest-to-goodness product, and 
generally speaking it is well to look at the original ways of makinb before accepting whole-heartedly all the modern 
'improvements.' This is true enough of soda brea, a staple Irish food. To the Irish wife the use of yeast for bread came
slowly, and even now soda bread is preferred by the old country people. Four, salt, baking soda, and good buttermilk were the 
ingredients as I knew them long ago. The acid of the buttermilk in conjunction with baking soda was sufficient to release the 
ncessary carbonic acid gas to make the bread light. Nowadays in most recipes one sees that a mixture of soda and cream or
tartar is called for. Buttermilk of the kind that we had then is less pelntiful or procurable now, so one must accept midifications. Even so, bread and
scones made with sour milk and a modified amount of cream of tartar are better, I think, than the more modern baking-powder bread mixed
with sweet mlk. To make good soda bread of a light and melting texture buttermilk or sour milk is essential. When sweet milk
is used the amount of cream of tartar is generally twice that of bicarbonate of soda; if sour milk is used one may reduce the 
amount of cream of tartar to equal to or even less than that of bicarbonate of soda. For this type of bread no rising is called for; 
the moment soda bread is mixed it must be oven cooked. Only the lightest kneading, enough for shaping, is required; anything more makes the
bread heavy. Three kinds of soda bread were common, white, fly, and brown, the fly variety containing currants in rather 
exiguous quantities. Ours, of course, was baked wither  on a girdle or in the oven, but up in the hills the farmer's wife 
used either her girdle or her pot-oven, and the loaves or farls to be cooked on the former might be 1 1/2-2-inches thick, and were stared off on moderate
heat so that they were cooked through before the browning process began. When baked and brown below the loaves were turned and 
finished off. What we liked best in those far-off days were the loaves of the wiefe who cooked them in her Irish pot-oven. These had a
thin skin-like crust, a brownness and flavour all their own, a perfeftcion achieved by no written rules but by years of 
practice. The dougn was put into the heated, floured pot with room left for rising, the upturned lid was put on the few hot turfs set in it, then th pot was set in the hot
ash at the side of the fire. It is a long time since I or any of my contemporaries watched this being done--we only remember it. 
We bake our soda bread now sometimes in the oven but preferably on a girdle, and this must be heated to the right degree. A common 
mistake is to get this too hot to begin with, and then the crust of the bread cooks too quickly while the inside remains
uncooked. A good teast is that when flour is dusted on to the greased girdle it becomes light brown in clour in about 3 minutes. It is 
desirable to turn the loaves only once, baking as far as possible on one side before turning. If the girdle overheats this point may
have to be disregarded. The dough is shaped with the hands into a large flat round and then with a sharp knife cut across into four; these are called 
farls. We still make all three varieties, using half brown and half white flour for brown loaves and 1 1/2 oz. currants per pound of
flour for the fly variety."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Lefse</b></font><br>

Bread is a universal food. Ingredients, recipes, cooking methods, cultural position and table placement vary according to place/people/period. Norwegian Lefse is a 
perfect example. This special griddle bread has may variations. Traditionalists still use specialized cooking utensils to achieve this particular bread. Modern cooks 
approximate by adapting ingredients and appliances. Lefse <a href="http://foodtimeline.org/norwaybread">grains</a> also vary through the ages.
<p>
<b>What is Lefse?</b><br>
"The quality of the flatbread depends upon what sort of flour is used. The same is true for the soft thin bread often known as lefse/levse/lafsa. It was usually baked 
for feasts, and rye or wheat was then preferred (from the nineteenth century, <a href="foodbreads.html#potato">potatoes</a> too). In some areas the soft breads are soft from the beginning,because they 
are fried less than the crisp ones, but in most places the lefse is made the same way as crisp bread and stored. When it is prepared for use, it is sprinkled with water
 to become soft. At festive occasions lefse is buttered and folded according to certain established rule, which are different from region to region. Up until the early 
twentieth century people baked lefse in the homes, but today a lot of small bakeries deliver the crisp kind in cartons or the soft king in plastic bags."<br>
---<i>Food Culture in Scandinavia</i>, Henry Notaker [Greenwood Press:Westport CT] 2009 (p. 50) <br>
<p>
<b>Norwegian-American traditions</b><br>
Lefse, like many other traditional dishes adopted of the years by American cooks with strong "0ld Country' roots Lefse has many variations. Each recipe reflects a 
special connection with unique family roots. Below please find general notes on Norwegian Lefse. Attached please find several recipe variations. Our research 
suggests potato variations are especially beloved in Minnesota. This "new world" ingredient was not known in Northern Europe until the 16th century. 
<p>
"In Norway today lefse is omitted from full meals, as are all breads, except flat bread; in Minnesota, however, lefse appears regularly as a unique ethnic specialty at 
community dinners, bazaars, and family meals. There seems to be an infinite variety of lefse produced in the villages, valleys and regions of Norway, but in Minnesota the item is fairly predictable. Specifically referred to as 'potato lefse' in Norway, the usual Minnesota version calls for mashed potatoes, salt, shortening, and flour. The ingredients are combined while hot, then chilled, rolled into thin flat rounds, and baked on a stove top or a large griddle. The most typical lefse in Norway, especially from the western regions, is here called 'Hardanger' or "Norwegian' lefse. Three egg yolks, baking soda, and buttermilk replace the potatoes. When baked, this lefse is extremely crisp and must be softened before serving by being placed between two damp towels. Kept dry, it may be stored indefinitely; in fact, rural Norwegian bake lefse only a few times a year, storing the accumulation in an out building called a bryggehause.. The modern Norwegian American's lefse grill might be sold as a 'Heritage Grill' or a pancake griddle and is usually thought of as an all-purpose cooking surface. The 'lefse stick,' a flat two-foot by three-quarter-inch wide wand, is an indispensable utensil that the cook slips under the lefse, deftly turning it to brown on both sides. Minnesota lefse is somewhat thinner than a commercially prepared tortilla but is much larger and softer. Traditionally, the surface is a mottled brown and white, a result of uneven cooking due to variations in flour, potatoes, or other ingredients. The younger generation of Norwegian Americans, especially those who learned to cook lefse in church kitchens, are more demanding of consistency. In order to achieve and even-colored lefse and eliminate brown spots, they use commercially prepared potato flakes and rely on one brand of flour, which the community had agreed is the best. Lefse is served plain, with butter, butter and sugar, or wrapped around a filling. Many think of lefse when they want a snack and sometimes use it as a vehicle for herring, goat-milk cheese (jokingly called 'Norwegian peanut butter' because of its color, consistency, and popularity), cold mashed potatoes, sliced meatballs, or even cold lutefisk."

"Lefse is a Norwegian bread that resembles a large flour tortilla but is made with a potato dough and has a different texture and flavor than tortillas. It is rolled out with a special rolling pin, handled with a slecial wooden stick and cooked on a special griddle. making lefse is not yet a lost art. But it is dwindling...Only russet potatoes should be used for lefse...The potatoes are peeled and boiled with lots of salt. If necessary, salt also can be added later to the dough...Nothing is added to the potatoes while they are being mashed. Afterward they are mixed with butter and evaporated milk. When cool, they are mixed with flour to make a dough. Lefse is traditionally rolled out with a ridged rolling pin, which helps to get the dough thin and makes a pattern on the surface. The pins, the long wooden sticks used to transfer the lefse to the griddle and electric lefse griddles, and be found in Scandinavian stores. The large round griddles are manufactured in Minneapolis. Lefse can also be cooked on an ordinary griddle on the range, in an electric skillet or in an iron skillet. In this case, the lefse must be made smaller to fit the utensil. In rolling lefse, it is important to roll out the edges so they will be as thin as the rest of the circle. Lefse is served warm with butter and with or without sugar. The lefse is buttered, sprinkled with sugar if desired, rolled up and cut into shorter lengths for serving...Lefse can also be cut into pie-shaped wedges, buttered, sprinkled with sugar and rolled.

Peel potatoes and cook in boiling salted water until tender, using twice as much salt a usual. Drain potatoes and put through a ricer, beat in a mixer or mash until no lumps remain. Mix in butter and milk while potatoes are hot. Let stand overnight at room temperature. Do not cover, but lay a clean towel over bowl at nights. In the morning, measure potatoes. Add half as much flour as potatoes and mix well with the hands as in mixing bread dough. Press dough down evenly in a 9X12-in pan and chill at least 1 hr. before using to make dough easier to roll. Take a piece of dough the size of a large egg or small hamburger patty. Pat it out on the floured pastry cloth, then roll it with a ridged lefse rolling pin into a circle as thin as possible. Transfer lefse with a lefse stick to an ungreased lefse grill, and iron griddle or an iron skillet. (Make lefse small if necessary to fit size of griddle).

<b>Historic grains & breads of Norway</b><p> 
<b>VIKING ERA</b> "Two sorts of bread are mentioned in the RigsPula, the white loaves of wheat in the home of the nobleman and the heavy loaves of coarse
 bread in the thrall's cabin. Very little wheat was cultivated in Scandinavia, and importing it was necessary. Wheat products were very exclusive and primarily 
enjoyed by the elite for festive occasions, and wheat was used in the hold bread at the communion table of the churches. Neither was rye extensively cultivated, 
even if this grain, so well suited for bread baking, steadily increased in importance, especially in Denmark and souther Sweden, where it has dominated since c.
 1500. The cultivation of rye was accompanied by new baking techniques, the use of leaven and ovens. The first and simpler ovens were made of brick, but solid 
stone ovens were built in palaces and manors, and also in the northern parts. From the late Middle Ages commercial bakeries and guilds of professional bakers are
 documented. The coarse loaves in the poem may be representative of the earliest breads. As in other parts of the world, they were simply made by shaping a flat 
cake of dough, made from flour or crushed grains kneaded with water or another liquid, and put in the ashes or on the embers or on a flat stone beside the fire. The 
process is a natural interpretation of names such as ashen bread and ember cake, words used in both Norwegian and Swedish. Early on, these breads were mainly 
baked from oats and barley, and they were unleavened because those two grains don't contain the necessary gluten for leaven baking. In hard times they might be
 unsavory and coarse in poor homes because of the substituted for grains added to the dough: husks, crushed and dried bark, and in Iceland also reindeer moss. 
Barley is the oldest grain in Scandinavia and dominant in the north and in the mountainous regions, while oats were introduced in more humid areas. Barley or oats 
were also the basic ingredient in porridge and gruel, the most common of daily dishes, and the main source of starch besides bread in the nutrition of ordinary 
people."<br>---<i>Food Culture in Scandinavia</i>, Henry Notaker [Greenwood Press:Westport CT] 2009 (p. 3-4) 
<p>
<b>EARLY MODERN PERIOD</b> "Scandinavian breads were of many sorts and forms: round or oblong, thin or thick, leavened or unleavened. They were
 baked from many different grains. Barley and oats were common in the North, rye in the South, whereas wheat bread--in the early modern period as in the 
Middle Ages--was primarily eaten by the elite, at festival time, and in church rituals (holy bread)...Unleavened breads were baked on stones (slabs of rocks), 
griddles, or small frying pans. They had in common that they could not be kept for more than a few days. It is possible that the need for preservation was one of the 
motivating forces behind the very thin dry and crisp breads that could be stored for years. They are typical of northern Scandinavia...In grains had been ground on 
manually operated rotary querns, but in the late Middle Ages the millstones worked by steam water were introduced, and larger amounts of grain could be ground 
in a shorter time. But the mills depended on a good flow of water, which mainly occurred in spring and in autumn. And these two seasons were just the seasons for
 baking of the thin crisp bread."<br>---ibid (p. 16-17)

Monkey bread (aka pull-apart bread, bubble bread, Christmas morning delights) descends
from traditional sweet, yeast rolls with centuries of history. Food historians tell us the first peoples
to make sweet, buttery rolls with <a href="foodbreads.html#aboutcinnamon">cinnamon</a> were ancient Middle
Eastern cooks. These recipes and
spices traveled to Europe in the Middle Ages with crusaders, travellers, traders and explorers.
Recipes varied according to culture and cuisine, but the concept remained stable. German kuchen,
French <a href="foodbreads.html#foodcakes.html#galette">galette</a>, Pennsylvania Dutch <a
href="foodbreads.html#stickybuns">sticky buns</a>, and monkey bread all descended from these old recipes.
<p>
 Culinary evidence confirms the practice of combining little balls of dough in one pan for cooking
was popular in the mid-19th century. Parker House rolls are perhaps one of the best known
examples. Pioneers and cowboys also favored one-pot baked goods because they adapted easily
to portable Dutch ovens. Early-mid 20th century American cookbooks are full of recipes for
refrigerator rolls; dough chilled overnight which could be used to make breads of many shapes
and flavors. "Clover leaf" rolls with cinnamon and butter toppings were common. Modern recipes with this name date in print to 1945. Some
food historians state Monkey Bread was a collaborative culinary product of ZaSu Pitts (actress & accomplihsed cook/cook book author) and Ann King (her African-
American Albany Texas cook). Ms. Pitts' recipe <a href="foodbreads.html#pittsmonkey">here</a>.
<p>
<b>How did monkey bread get its name?</b><br>
 Food historians offer several theories (see below). All are
interesting; none are definative. 
<p>
"Monkey bread. This pull-apart yeast bread, also known as "bubble loaf," began showing up in
women's magazines and community cookbooks back in the 1950s. There are two types, a savory
and a sweet...The sweet is also known a bubble loaf because the dough is pinched off and rolled
into balls. These are dipped in melted butter and then layered into the pan with a flavoured sugar
mixture or a caramel or brown sugar glaze."<br>
---<i>American Century Cookbook: The Most Popular Recipes of the 20th Century</i>, Jean
Anderson [Clarkson Potter:New York] 1997 (p. 312)
<p>
"Monkey bread. A sweet yeast bread, sometimes mixed with currants, formed from balls of
dough, laid next to one another, which combine during baking. The origin of the name is
unknown, though it has been suggested that the bread resembles the monkey puzzle tree
(Araucaria araucana), whose prickly branches make it difficult to climb. There is also a fruit called
"monkey bread," from the baobab tree...of Africa, but there is not evidence of any connection
between it and baked bread. It is probably that the name comes from the appearance of the baked
itself, which resembles a bunch on monkeys jumbled together."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New
York] 1999 (p. 208)<br>
[NOTE: According to the <i>Oxford English
Dictionary</i> (2nd edition) the term "monkey-bread," meaning the fruit of the baobab tree,
dates in print to 1789.]
<p>
"Since monkeys are known for gleefully pulling at, well, everything, it makes sense that an
audience-participation loaf should be called monkey bread. Formed of balls of dough and baked in
a ring mold, monkey bread emerges as golden puffs that are irresistible to both hand and eye. The
idea is that you pick it apart like a bunch of . . . that it's more fun than a barrel of. . . . You get the
idea. (The actual cucumber-shaped fruit of the baobab tree that goes by the same name isn't much
good to anyone except its namesake -- unless you're in the market for a float to hold up your
fishing nets.) With a kind of simian stealth, monkey bread has entered American cuisine, not
through high-end restaurants but via the food pages of newspapers across the country and
Internet chat rooms. Cindy Crawford prepared her family's version on "Good Morning America"
just in time for Christmas 1999, and even in this carb-abhoring age when Dr. Atkins rules
supreme, it was one of the two most requested recipes of 2002 from the <i>Chicago
Sun-Times</i> Swap Shop column. Variations range from those heavily sweetened with pecans
and
cinnamon, a virtual coffee cake, to ones with blueberries, butterscotch and even Parmesan cheese,
garlic and herbs. But we're not exactly talking haute cuisine. Way too many versions use frozen
biscuit dough, and many encourage the participation of children in the cooking as well as the
eating. But while no four-star chef seems to have proclaimed his devotion to monkey bread, there
is one exemplar of high style and taste who has happily attached her name to this confection.
Nancy Reagan served monkey bread in the White House, especially during the holidays, and her
recipe was printed in the <i>American Cancer Society Cookbook</i>, published in 1985. Not
surprisingly, her version is monkey bread at its purest and most elegant: buttery and yeasty, as
much brioche as bread."<br>

6; Page 64)<br>
[NOTE: Reagan-era <a href="foodbreads.html#reaganmonkeybread"">Monkey Bread recipe</a>.]
<p>
"The origin of the name "monkey bread" is anyone's guess. One reader wrote that the name is
derived from the amount of "monkeying around" needed to prepare the balls of dough. Another
theory comes from the notion of pulling apart the sections of cake and playing with your food in
monkey-like fashion."<br>

<a name="nationalloaf">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>National Loaf (UK)</b></font><br>
The term "national loaf" or "national bread" surfaces thrice in modern English history. In the late 19th century, the term meant bread made with domestic wheat. 
Primary accounts confirm substantial reliance on imported wheat to satisfy demands for this most staple food. This "national loaf" was promoted as patriotic,
superior, and sustainable. During WWI, bread was rationed. The term "national loaf" was a metaphor for providing adequate food for citizens, not an actual product.
During World War II, "national bread" was an actual commercial product subsidized by the English government to ensure adequate bread supply for citizens. The bread was introduced
in 1941 and sold through 1953. 
<p>
<b>[1895]</b><br>
"Can nothing practical be done to help the cultivation of wheat in England? Of all the national industries which have been brought to ruin by cheap production and carriage 
over seas,
the case of wheat is the strangest...Good English wheat is superior in certain definite respects to all other kinds; bread made from it possesses qualities which not bread made
from foreign-grown wheat can rival. Morever, many consumers are quite aware of this, and would gladly get the native article if they could; but they are helpless in the hands of the trade, which has been drifting for a long time into 
the way of using more and more foreign flour...We can never grow enough wheat in this country to furnish ore than a fraction of our bread supply; why should not the well-to-do
public have the option of of purchasing that fraction at a somewhat higher price than the inferior foreign stuff? It would cost the no more than they already pay for a 
great deal of their bread and they would get value for their money. The point is that at present the public has no choice in the matter. It buys bread just as bread,
 without distinguishing or having the opportunity of distinguishing, between the materials of which it is made. Comparatively few bakers even know or are what flour they are
using or where it comes from. But give consumers the option of buying a standard 'national' loaf containing a guaranteed amount of English wheat, and there can be o doubt that they will readily by it at a price which would make
wheat-growing remunerative to the British farmer. At any rate, the experiment is worth making and it can be done without cost or difficulty by a little organization.
Let us go somewhat more into detail to make the idea clearer. The qualities in which bread made from English wheat is superior are the following: (1) It has more flavour,
(2) it keeps fresh longer,  (3) it is more satisfying...there is no reason why this movement should not be checked and English wheat be put on its legs again by voluntary effort,
without violating any principles of supply and demand. An ordinary West-end price of best bread at present is 6d, the quartern. At this price millers profit, while paying the farme 30 s. a 
quarrter. Give the public the chance of buying such a loaf, guaranteed to be of a standard quality and quite a sufficient number will avail themselves of it to appreciably 
increase the demand for English wheat, not merely from patriotic motives but because they will get a better article."<br>
---"The National Loaf, a suggestion," <i>St. James's Gazette</i>, [London], September 4, 1895 (p. 4)
<p>
Commenting on the proposal put forward in these columns for the formation of a National Loaf League, the object being to produce and  vend a loaf which shall contain 50 or 75 per cent of British grown flour, the <i>Manchester City News</i> says:--There is nothing to be said against the suggestion; but everything in its favour. The buyer of the national Loaf would pay more for it, but he would undoubtedly get a more substantial and satisfying food. There is already much irregularity in prices of bread retailed; prices ranging from fourpence to fivepence-half penny the four pounds for the same alleged quality of bread. No doubt a flour-pound loaf made of English wheat should be sold retail at sixpence, and leave the farmer thirty shillings a quarter for his wheat. The St. James Gazette makes an appeal to the well-to-do classes to support the proposed League and go in for a national loaf on something like philanthropic and patriotic principlesThere is little doubt that there would be an immediate demand for it so long as customers could be sure of getting the genuine article. All that is required is for some reliable bread-baker to produce the article and guarantee for its purity.<br>

"The much proclaimed 'National Loaf' of bread will soon make its appearance in Britain, the food ministry disclosed today. It will be made from 85 per cent whole wheat
flour, which is said to be more digestible than the bread of 100 per cent whole wheat. Arrangements have been made with millers and bakers for immediate production of
whole wheat flour and bread in quantities sufficient to meet all demands. The loaf will be standardized. The much heralded 'fortified white loaf,' to which vitamin B1 and calcium
would be added, will not be available for a few months, the food ministry said. Some food experts complained that the vitaminized bread would be a snare and a delusion if the
public relieved in its advertised health properties."<br>

imported white flour, oats products, barley, rye, milk powder, and calcium.' Bakers also may see a proportion of potatoes and potato flour. The composition of the 
national bread is not standardized throughout the country, Mabane said, but the proportion of silutants, 'altho it may vary slightly in different areas, does not 
generally exceed 5 per cent.' The British Hotels and Restaurants association today advised its memebers to serve bread only in small pieces, and rolls of not more than one-half 
ounce weight; not to place butter on the table because it 'encourages consumption of bred,' and to serve large portions of potatoes and other vegetables."<br>

the first time for 12 years...the Churchill government has felt it wise to compromise lest there should be too violent an outcry and too big a rush of new wage claims to meet 
higher food costs. It has been decided...to continue the subsidized one and three-quarter pound national loaf at sevenpence halfpenny (eight sents). Bakers will be 
obliged to supply this loaf. Its price will be kept down by subsidy. But there will be an alternative, unsubsidized, really white loaf at about tenpence. What is more, it will be a better white loaf tha the prewar white loaf
because it will have put back into it all the vitamins and nutritious what-nots which are taken out to make it white and which in the old days were not put back in again."<br>

Pain de Campagne (literally translated from French as "Country Bread") is a naturally leavened round loaf. The natural leavener is similar to American sourdough.
 Our survey of bread history souces and historic (American) newspaper articles and magazines reveals this type of of bread was enjoyed long before the 
unbiquitous baguette, now generally considered synonymous with "French Bread." Pan de Campagne, and other rustic county loaves, have enjoyed a resurgence of
 culinary interest in recent years. American food critics offer two possible reasons (1) The decline of the quality of the baguette (2) Consumer interest in a wider
 variety of breads beyond the plain soft white sandwich loaf. Bakery chains such as Panera Bread are happily capitalizing on this delicious market.

""For nearly all English people who have ever set foot in France, the words 'French Bread' evoke a golden-brown baguette...English bakers, and indeed many of 
the older French ones, still call this type of bread 'Vienna' bread, the true French bread being the old round or cylindrical and-shaped pain de campagne or pain de
 menage, plumb and crossed with cuts so that when baked the crust if of many different shades, gradations and textures and the crumb rather open and coarse. It is
 this bread which is now enjoying something of a revival in France, perhaps because the Vienna types has not taken very kindly to the short-time dough maturing 
and the rapid mechanical kneading and moulding techniques of the 1970s, partly because a well-made pain de campagne keeps much better than baguette loaves, 
which is to say that it will stay moist for as long as two days, even three, whereas the long, crusty, thin loaf is, as we know, stale within an hour of emerging from
 the oven, and for the French three days is a long time to keep a loaf of bread..."<br>

""I have myself also found, in spite of the delicious qualities of the baguette loaf at its best, that pain de campagne, nowadays made with wheat flour, and often on 
the leaven system, can be much better. In small town and village bakeries in the Nivernais, in the Auvergne, in the Ardeche and in the Jura, I have found big round
 loaves so good and whith a flavour and texture so unlike any others in their true savour and their incomparable scent that it is this bread that I would make, were it 
feasible, rather than any of the baguette type after wihch so many people hanker in vain."<br>
---ibid (p. 279) 
<p>
"The French pain de campagne made on the old leaven system has been mentioned more than once in these notes. The following passage from one of William 
Jago's fine works on professional breadmaking explains how the dough was fermented: 'In France and other parts of the continent bread is made from leaven which 
consists of a portion of dough held over from the previous baking. The following descriptin is given on the authority of Watt's Dictionary of Chemistry. 'A lump of
 dough from the preceding batch of bread is preserved; this weighs about 12 lbs, made up of 8 lbs of four to 4 lbs of water, and is the fresh leaven (levain de chef). 
This fresh leaven after reamining for 15 hours, is kneaded in with an equal quantity of fresh flour and water, and this produces the levain de premiere; again this is 
allowed to stand for some hours 9about eight) and is kneaded in with more flour and water. After another interval of 3 hours, 100 lbs of flour, 52 of water, and 
about 1/3 lb lf beer yeast are added; this produced the finished leaven (levain de tout point)...In the more important towns this mode of bread-making is now largely
 supplanted by the use of distillers' yeast, and seems now to have largely given place to methods more nearly allied to Viennese and Englsih processes. Leaven 
fermentation is due to the presence in the leaven of certain species of yeast, which grow and multiply in that medium. These induce alcoholic fermentation of the 
sugar of the flour.'---William Jago and William C. Jago, <i>The Technology of Bread Making</i>, 1921).'"<br>
---ibid (p. 381-382)

are back in vogue and, once again, prevail in the smaller bakeries of France."<br>

<a name="panko">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Panko</b> (Japanese-style bread crumbs)</font><br>
Food historians generally credit the Portuguese for introducing bread/breading to Japan cuisine in the
16th century. <a href="foodmeats.html#tempura">Tempura</a> a fusion of these two cuisines. 
<p>
Our survey of food history sources suggests modern panko has been used by Japanese cooks for a century or so. This
exotic item caught the attention of American chefs in the early 1980s. Chiefly featured for outer coatings "panko encrusted,"
 this Oriental product does not play a supporting role like traditional breadcrumbs mixed in meatloaf. Panko remains
 popular in 21st century due to its interesting texture, subtle flavor
and striking visual appeal. Today, Panko can be found in most mainstream USA 
supermarkets. Some stores position panko in the ethnic aisle; others shelve it in the breadcrumb/stuffing 
section along with standard American brands. Today we have Italian style and chipotle flavored panko. Only in America!
<p>
"A Japanese product called panko sounds as if it might be the next toy craze. But a kitchen
craze is more like it. Panko is Japanese for bread crumbs, and chefs and home cooks are
discovering that this light, airy variety is worlds away from the acrid, herb-flecked,
additive-laden bread crumbs in the supermarket, the more upscale crumbs from a bakery like
Ecce Panis
or even homemade bread crumbs from leftover loaves. Panko has a texture more like crushed
cornflakes or potato chips, but with a neutral flavor, only a trifle sweet. Some panko is made
with honey, some with sugar, but all contains a sweetener and some kind of fat, which makes the
crumbs brown easier.
Panko is what gives tonkatsu, the fried pork cutlet served in Japanese restaurants, its
coarse-grained, crunchy crumb coating. Some caterers in New York and California have also
started
using panko to give deep-fried cocktail party shrimp a textural boost and keep sogginess at bay.
''The texture of the crumbs is very important in the way it performs,'' said Wayne Nish, the chef
and an owner of March restaurant, who was among the first to use panko to bread chicken, fish
and even rack of lamb in non-Japanese recipes. ''The structure creates little air pockets to help
keep it crispy.''
In a way, panko is coming full circle around the globe these days. It actually reached Japan via
Western cuisines. In 1543, bread was introduced to Japan by Portuguese traders, the first
Europeans to land there. The Portuguese word for bread, pao, became pan. Around 100 years
ago, the Japanese interest in Western food grew, said Elizabeth Andoh, a cookbook author and
teacher, who is based in Tokyo. ''In particular, there was a fascination with German and Prussian
food, a result of the Japanese envy of German military prowess,'' she said. ''They thought the diet
was an important factor in German might, so the Japanese imitated Wiener schnitzel with pork,
calling it katsudetsu, which became tonkatsu. They used ground dried bread, or panko, as a
coating. And they first began serving it in the military academies.''
Japan won its war with Russia in 1905, and that did it, Ms. Andoh said. Guns, tonkatsu and
panko were there to stay. Japanese bread is essentially a dense, white squared-off sandwich
bread, what might be called a Pullman loaf. But it has a striated texture, and when it dries and is
pulverized, it breaks into spiky little shards, instead of fine, sandlike crumbs. Masayuki Shimura,
the manager of Inagiku restaurant in the Waldorf-Astoria, said that most Japanese panko makers
no longer bake bread and pulverize it, but have machines that spray unbaked bread dough
directly onto heated iron sheets and bake it into shards. Panko in Japan is sold in rough, medium
and fine textures, Mr. Shimura said.
He said panko is not for fancy food; at his restaurant it is used only for dishes served to
employees, not on the regular menu. In takeout shops in Japan, Ms. Andoh said, panko is used
to coat croquettes, which are eaten at room temperature or reheated. Yet the Fauchon store in
Tokyo makes its own panko from white bread like the kind the Japanese delight in slicing thick
and toasting for breakfast.
Panko not only provides a crispy coating, but it also makes a lighter stuffing for anything from
mushrooms to trout, especially when the crumbs are toasted first. And it's even good to sweeten
and use to layer phyllo or in a pie shell. Barry Wine, the restaurant consultant, who often travels
to Japan, said he has used panko as a topping for macaroni and cheese, and to add extra texture
to French toast. Whenever a crunchy coating is desired, and especially if the breaded food will
be in contact with moisture, panko delivers abiding crunch."<br>

30, 1998 (p. F3)

"ASK THE COOKS This week's answer is by Peter J. Kelly, a chef- instructor at Johnson &
Wales University.
What is the difference between panko (Japanese bread crumbs) and regular bread crumbs? Why
does panko absorb less oil?...By regular bread crumbs, you
most likely mean those bought in a can or made at home using stale or fresh bread. Most people
are familiar with ground bread crumbs that yield a smooth, fine coating for frying or are used as
a binder in something like meatballs. These crumbs are distant relatives of Japanese panko. Once
difficult to find outside of Asian groceries, panko is now sold at a growing number of
supermarkets in their international-foods sections. Panko is manufactured using a process
invented in Japan in the 1970s. While the secret to panko is closely guarded, we do know that
yeast-leavened bread is baked to extract as much moisture as possible. This dry cooking method,
along with a special flaking technique, yields a fluffy, dry crumb that absorbs very little oil. This
quality comes in handy when frying at home, where it is often difficult to regulate the
temperature of cooking fat. When frying, it is recommended that the oil be around 350 degrees.
At lower temperatures, foods tend to absorb fat; at higher temperatures, foods will brown
without cooking to the center. Panko can help soften the blow of a culinary error."<br>

The story of Parker House rolls, like many popular foods, is part legend, part truth. Here's what
the food historians have to say:
<p>
"Parker House rolls originated during the 1870s at Boston's Parker House Hotel, which opened
in 1856. They are made by folding a butter-brushed round of dough in half; when baked, the roll
has a pleasing abundance of crusty surface. Recipes for Parker House rolls first appeared in
cookbooks during the 1880s."<br>
---<i>Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America</i>, Andrew F. Smith editor [Oxford
University Press:New York] 2004, Volume 1 (p. 117)
<p>
"Parker House roll. A puffy yeast roll with a creased center, created at the Parker House Hotel in
Boston soon after its opening in 1855 by the kitchen's German baker, whose name was Ward.
One story holds that Ward, in a fit of pique over a guest's belligerence, merely threw some
unfinished rolls into the oven and came up with the little bun that made his employer, Harvery
Parker, famous. Such light, puffy rolls, sometimes called "pocketbook rolls" because of their
purselike appearance, were a novelty in their day and became a standard item in American dining
rooms and tables."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New
York] 1999 (p. 231)
<p>
"The Parker House is one of Boston's oldest and most distinguished hotels. These rolls (which
helped in their little way to make the hotel renowned) became popular throughout New England
and were generally called pocketbook rolls. The story of their origin goes back to the days of
Harvey Parker, the Maine coachman who founded the hotel. One of Mr. Parker's first guests was
a lady from London who misplaced her diamonds. "The chambermaid," she cried, "has stolen my
diamonds!" And she went screaming through the hotel, clear down to the kitchen. The pastry
cook, who was in love with the chambermaid, heard the commotion and was so angry he picked
up pieces of dough in his fists and slammed them into the oven. When the rolls were baked--there
was no time to make fresh ones, so they were served as they were (dented in the
middle)--everyone said they were delicious. The outside was crisp and the inside was soft.
Meantime the
lady had found her diamonds. But from that day to this, Parker House rolls have been dented in
the middle."<br>
---<i>New England Cookbook</i>, Eleanor Early [Random House:New York] 1954 (p. 19)

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Parthian bread</b></font><br>
The Pliny quote referencing "Parthian Bread" <a href="foodbreads.html#parthianquotes">repeated by food historians</a> was first published in his <a href="foodbreads.html#naturalhistory"><i>Natural History</i></a>, Volume IV. Here Pliny describes in detail the 
various types of grains and other items ground for making bread. Pliny appears to promote the fine wheats of the Middle East as superior to those found in his native Italy. 
Then, as today, <a href="foodbreads.html#romanwhitebread">soft white bread</a> was considered superior to hard products made with coarser or less glutinous grains. Pliny describes the general bread making process 
but does not offer recipes. This is understandable, given the fact that most "recipes" for foods were not published in ancient times. What we know about foods of this 
period come from artistic renderings (Ancient Egyptian tomb drawings), literature (poems, folklore, religious writings), and archaeological evidence (cookshop ruins, 
middens, funery offerings) etc. "Ancient" recipes we find today are approximations made by chefs who have studied ancient ingredients, cooking methods, flavor 
preferences, and dining customs. Recipes listing ingredients, method and baking temps/times evolved later. Even then, the instructions were meant for experience cooks
 who understood what phrases like "add enough water" and "bake until done" meant. Modernized recipe, courtesy of chef Cathy Kaufman, <a href="foodbreads.html#modernparthian">here</a>.

<b>About Ancient Romans and white bread</b><p> 
"We are in possession of detailed descriptions of the views the Romans held on bread. For these we have to thank Pliny, who died in the year A.D. 79, and Varro, who 
lived a century before Pliny who lived a century before Pliny. Their observations have been correlated by Bennett and Elton. Reading what those authorities had to say 
throws still more light on our present attitude to white bread. It shows again that the preference for white bread goes far back into history, much further than might be 
assumed from the preceding sections...According to Pliny, bread of the very finest quality is that which is sine pondere, without heaviness. The lightness of bread made 
from white wheat flour is the excessive factor in the preference for this flour. If one sees white flour, one does not think of the colour by itself, but of the lightness of the
 bread which can be baked from it."<br>

<b>PLINY ON BREAD, FROM NATURAL HISTORY, VOLUME IV </b><br>
Pliny's Text below was extracted from GoogleBooks online version (google pliny bread parthian) to find quickly. Keep in mind translations vary according to the interpretation and skill of the person attempting the task. Chapter 27 specifically references Parthian Bread (we bolded the text). The sentence following the mention of this bread talks about soaking bread in milk and honey. It seems to us from this translation, that Pliny is talking about a different kind of bread, not Parthian at that point. Since all bread making requires some water, we have no idea what Pliny meant by "water bread." The amount of water/liquid required to achieve an edible loaf is determined by the wheat (hard, soft), other liquidy ingredient (eggs, oil), and desired finished product. 
<p>
"(10.) Wheat yields a fine flour' of the very highest quality. In African wheat the modius ought to yield half a modius of line flour and five Bextarii of pollen, that being the name given to fine wheat meal, in the same way that that of winter wheat is generally known as " flos," or the " flower." This fine meal is extensively used in copper works and paper manufactories. In addition to the above, the modius should yield four sextarii of coarse meal, and the same quantity of bran. The finest wheaten flour will yield one hundred and twentytwo pounds of bread, and the fine meal of winter wheat one hundred and seventeen, to the modius of grain. When the prices of grain are moderate, meal sells at forty asses the modius, bolted wheaten flour at eight asses more, and bolted flour of winter wheat, at sixteen asses more. There is another distinction again in fine wheaten flour, which originated formerly in the days of L. Paulus. There were three classes of wheat; the first of which would appear to have yielded seventeen pounds of bread, the second eighteen, and the third nineteen pounds and a third : to these were added two pounds and u half of seconds,91 and the same quantity of brown' bread, with six sextarii of bran.92... 
<p>
CHAP. 26. (11) THE VARIOUS KINDS OF LEAVEN. 
Millet is more particularly employed for making leaven ; and if kneaded with must,19 it will keep a whole year. The same is done, too, with the fine wheat-bran of the best quality; it is kneaded with white must three days old, and then dried in the sun, after which it is made into small cakes. When required for making bread, these cakes are first soaked in water, and then boiled with the finest spelt flour, after which the whole is mixed up with the meal; and it is generally thought that this is the best method of making bread. The Greeks have established a rule that for a modius of meal eight ounces of leaven is enough. 
These kinds of leaven, however, can only he made at the time of vintage, but there is another leaven which may be prepared with barley and water, at any time it may happen to be required. It is first made up into cakes of two pounds in weight, and these are then baked upon a hot hearth, or else in an earthen dish upon hot ashes and charcoal, being left till they turn of a reddish brown. When this is done, the cakes are shut close in vessels, until they turn quite sour: when wanted for leaven, they are steeped in water first. When barley bread used to be made, it was leavened with the meal of the fitch,TM or else the chicheling vetch,21 the proportion being, two pounds of leaven to two modii and a half of barley meal. At the present day, however, the leaven is prepared from the meal that is used for making the bread. For this purpose, some of the meal is kneaded before adding the salt, and is then boiled to the consistency of porridge, and left till it begins to turn sour. In most cases, however, they do not warm it at all, but only make use of a little of the dough that has been kept from the day before. It is very evident that the principle which causes the dough to rise is of an acid nature, and it is equally evident that those persons who are dieted upon fermented bread are stronger" in body. Among the ancients, too, it was generally thought that the heavier wheat is, the more wholesome it is. 
<p>
CHAP. 27. THE METHOD OF MAKING BREAD : ORIGIN OF THE ART, 
It seems to me quite unnecessary to enter into an account of the various kinds of bread that are made. Some kinds, we find, receive their names from the dishes with which they are eaten, the oyster-bread,83 for instance: others, again, from their peculiar delicacy, the artolaganus,*1 or cake-bread, for example; and others from the expedition with which they are prepared, such as the " speusticus,"25 or " hurry-bread." Other varieties receive their names from the peculiar method of baking them, such as oven-bread,M tin-bread," and mouldbread.28 It is not so very long since that we had a bread introduced from Parthia, known as water-bread,29 from a method in kneading it, of drawing out the dough by the aid of water, a process which renders it remarkably light, and full of holes, like a sponge: some call this Parthian bread. The excellence of the finest kinds of bread depends principally on the goodness of the wheat, and the fineness of the bolter. Some persons knead the dough with eggs or milk, and butter even has been employed for the purpose by nations that have had leisure to cultivate the arts of peace, and to give their attention to the art of making pastry. Picenum still maintains its ancient reputation for making the bread which it was the first to invent, alica *> being the grain employed. The flour is kept in soak for nine days, and is kneaded on the tenth with raisin juice, in the shape of long rolls; after which it is baked in an oven in earthen pots, till they break. This bread, however, is never eaten till it has been well31 soaked, which is mostly done in milk mixed with honey." 
<p>
Another translation of this same passage: <p>
"As for bread itself, it is superfluous to give an account of the various types. In some places bread is called after the dishes eaten with it, such as oyster-bread, in others 
from its special delicacy, as cake-bread, in others from the short time spent baking it, as hasty bread, and also from the methods of baking, as oven bread or tin loaf or
 pan bread; while not long ago there was even bread imported from Parthia, called water bread because though the use of water it is drawn out into a thin spongy 
consistency full of holes; other just call it Parthian bread...Some use eggs or milk in kneading dough, while even butter has been used by races enjoying peace, when 
attention can be give to the varieties of pastry-making. Anacona still retains its reputation for inventing bread made from spelt. The flour is steeped for nine days and is 
kneaded on the tenth, with raisin juice, into the shape of a long roll and afterwards baked in earthenware pots until the pots break. This bread is not used for food until it 
has been soaked, for which milk or honey-water are mainly used."<br>

 'liquor', and, as I have already written in the chapter on different flours and meals, and repeated in many of the recipes, the question on the quantity of liquor or liquid 
which any given flour will absorb is something which everyone has to discover for himself."<br>

<b>Modernized recipe</b><br>
Culinary historian Cathy Kaufman includes a recipe for Pliny's Water Bread in her book <i>Cooking in Ancient Civilizations</i> [Greenwood Press:Westport CT] 2006 (p. 134-135) 
<blockquote>
<b>"Water Bread (Pliny 18.27)</b><br> 
It is not so very long since we had a bread introduced from Parthia, known as water bread, from a method in kneading it, of drawing out the dough by aid of water, a process which renders it remarkably light, and full of holes, like a sponge. 
<p>
This chewy, spongy bread results from a high ration of water to flour. It is bake on an inverted wok (metal handles only!) to yield large, flat loaves; it no wok is available, make the breads smaller and bake them on a griddle on top of the stove. 
<p>
1/2 teaspoon yeast <br>
2 1/2 cups stone-ground all-purpose flour, plus more for kneading and rolling <br>
1 teaspoon salt <br>
1 tablespoon honey <br>
1 cup lukewarm water, or as needed <br>
Vegetable or olive oil, as needed. <br>
1. Combine the yeast, flour, and salt in a bowl. Make a well in the center. Combine the honey and the water and slowly stir into the flour mixture to make a dough. Knead on a lightly floured surface for 7 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Transfer to a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. 
<p>
2. Deflate the dough and let rest 10 minutes. Divide the dough into six pieces. You will roll the dough in three stages to give the gluten time to relax. Working one at a time, roll each piece on a lightly floured surface into a 6-inch circle. Starting with the first disk (to make sure the gluten has relaxed enough), roll each circle into a disk about 9 inches in diameter; let rest for 10 minutes, then roll out into disks about 12-14 inches in diameter. 
<p>
3. Heat an inverted wok over a gas flame and oil lightly using an oiled paper towel held with tongs. Drape each disk over the rolling pin and transfer to the hot wok. Do not worry if the dough does not lay flat; let it cook before trying to straighten out any folds. Cook for 30 seconds. Turn with tongs and cook another 30 seconds; turn and cook another 15-20 seconds on the first side. Wrap in towels and keep warm while cooking the remaining breads."

Who made the first potato bread, when and where? Excellent question!
Breads containing mashed 
potatoes first surface in mid-18th century and proliferate a century later. Mashed (sieved) potatoes add 
color, texture, and a variety of nutrients to baked goods. The resulting product is lighter is than standard wheat bread. Cakes, biscuits and

"It did not take potato growers long to find a way to make flour from potatoes, and the next step was to add this to wheat or rye flour to make
bread. Beginning in the early eighteenth century, references to potato bread were published. Initially potato flour was probably used becasue it was
cheaper than wheat or rye flour, especially in times of famine or scarcity; but later some bakers concluded that adding potato flour--or mashed
potatoes--produced a better-tasting bread. At an rate, potato flour will not make a satsifactory bread because it does not develop gluten, which is necesssary
to give the bread substance and shape. A 1744 recipe for potato bread is very simple: 'This Root has often been employed, like the Turnep, towards making

Dough is done for bread.' In Germany potato bread may contain spelt and rye flour. In Ireland pratie oaten is made with mashed potatoes and rolled oats. In Scotalnd
tattie scones are made form mashed potatoes and just enough flour to make a dough that can be rolled and cut, and in England recipes for potato
cakes frequently appeared in the nineteenth century."<br>

"Potato bread. Usually associated with times of grain shortage, or with a need for strict economy 
in the kitchen, potato bread is also advocated by some nineteenth-century writers as being the 
best bread for toast. This is because a proportion of potato mixed with ordinary white flour 
makes a loaf which retains its moisture and is also very light. Dr. A. Hunter writing in a book 
called <i>Receipts in Modern Cookery; with a Medical Commentary</i>, first published in 1805, 
provided both a recipe, and in case it were needed yet more evidence of the English addition to 
toast: lovers of toast and butter will be much pleased with this kind of bread. The potato is not 
here added with a view of economy, but to increase the lightness of the bread, in which state it 
will imbibe the butter with more freedom...'" <br>

"How to Make Bread with Potatoes</b><br>
... If you will bake a Bushel, you shall take half a Bushel of these Roots, and putting them into two little Nets, which is a Peck into each Net, boyl them in a Kettle of 
water till they break between your fingers, but tlet them not break in the boyling; when they have boyled a quarter of an hour, in which time they will be boyled 
enough, take out the Nets, with the Roots, and hang them up a while, that the water may drain from the; then put them out into a wier Sieve, made for the purpose, 
being almost as thick as a course hair Sieve, and strengthened with three or four strong Wiers, or small Iron Rods, over-thwart the bottom; and with an Iron Truel
 let them be all broken, and rubbed through the bottom of the Sieve, into a Vessel underneath; by which means the Skins of the Roots will remain behind, and the 
Meal will pass through, being much like unto boyled Rice. Before you put the Roots into the Nets, you must cut the great ones into halves or quarters, otherwise the
 small ones will be boyled to pieces, before the great ones are boyled enough.
The Roots being thus prepared, you may make Bread of them after this manner.
You must take as much Wheat or Barley Flower as your half Bushel of Potato Meal weights, and mix them well together with your hands; then put to it
 as much warm water, mix'd with a little Barme, as you think will make it into very stiffe Dough, and as much Salt as is convenient; which being done, 
knead it well, until it be exactly mingled, which will quickly be, by reason of the dryness and mealiness of the Roots; afterwards make Loaves of it, and 
?ee that it be well baked."<br>

This is one of the best varieties of mixed or cheap bread when it is made with care, as its flavour

for it should be good, thoroughly boiled, well dried afterwards by having the water poured from 
them, and then standing by the side of the fire to steam; and be reduced to a perfect paste by 
mashing, or be rubbed quickly through a cullender or other coarse strainer. They should be 
perfectly mixed with the flour or meal while they are still warm; and after the addition of rather 
more salt than for common bread, the dough, which will require less liquid than wheaten-dough, 
should be made up smoothly and firmly, and be managed afterwards like other bread, but be 
baked in a more gently oven. Seven pounds of potatoes, weighed after they are cooked and 
peeled, may be added to each gallon of meal or flour. Should it be necessary, from circumstances 
that cannot be controlled, to use such as are watery, the moisture may be partly wrung from them, 
in a warm thick cloth, before they are mixed with the other ingredients." <br>

though a hair-sieve, and leave it ten minutes to settle, till the water is quite clear; then our off the water, and put a quart of fresh water to it; stir it
up, let it settle, and repeat this till the water is quite clear; you will at last find a fine white powder at the bottom of the vessel. (The criterion of this process being
complicated, is the purity of the water that comes form it after stirring it up.) Lay this on a sheet of paper in a hair-sieve to dry, either in the sun or before
the fire, and it is ready for use, and is a well-stoppered bottle will keep good for many months. If this be well made, half an ounce i.e. a table-spoonful)
of it mixed with two table-spoonfuls of cold water, and stirred into a soup or sauce, just before you take it up, will thicken a pint of it to the consistence
of cream. Obs. --This preparation much resembles the 'Indian arrow root,' and is a good substitute for it; it gives a fullness on the palate to gravies and sauces at hardly any
expense, and by some is used to thicken melted butter instead of flour. As it is perfectly tasteless, it will not alter the flavour of the most delicate
broth, &c.<br>

<b>"Of Flour of Potatoes.</b><br>
A patent has been recently obtained at Paris, a hgold medal bestowed, and other honorary distinctions granted, for the discovery and practice, on 
a large scale, of preparing from potatoes a fine flour; a sago, a flour equal to ground rice; and a semolina of paste, of which 1 lb. is equal to 1 1/2 lbs. of rice, 1 3/4 lbs.
of vermicelli, or, it is asserted, 8 lbs. of raw potatoes. These preparations are found valuable to mix with wheaten flour for bread, to make biscuits, 
pastry, pie-crusts, and for all soups, gruels, and panada. Large engagements have been made for these preparations with the French marine, and military and other 
hospitals, with the approbation of the faculty. An excellent bread, it is said, can be made of this flour, at half the cost of wheaten bread. Heat having been
applied in these preparations, the articles willkeep unchanged for years, and on board ship, to China and back; rats, mice, worms, and insects do not infect
or destroy this flour. Simply mixed with cold water, they are in ten minutes fit for food, when fire and all other resource may be wanted; and twelve ounces
are sufficient for a day's sustenance, in case of necessity. The physicians and surgeons in the hospitals, in cases of bread debility of the stomach, have
employed these preparations with advantage. The point of this discovery is, the cheapness of preparation, and the conversion of a surplus growth of potatoes into
a keeping stock, in an elegant, portable, and salubrious form."<br>

of the flour and potatoes so that the mixture becomes thickened to the consistency of starch, turn it into a granite-ware kettle and boil up for
a minute, stirring well to keep it from sticking and burning. If it becomes too much thickened, add a little more boiling
water. It is impossible to give the exact amount of water, since the quality of the flour will vary, and likewise the size of
the potatoes; but three pints is an approximate proportion. Strain the mixture through a fine colander into an earthen bread bowo, and let it cool When 
lukewarm, add one cup of good, lively yeast. Cover with a napkin, and keep in a moderately warm place for several hours, or until it ceases to 
ferment. As it begins to ferment, stir it well occasionally, and when well fermented, turn into a clean glass or earthen jar. The next
morning cover closely, and put in the cellar or refrigerator, not, however in contact with the ice. It is best to reserve enough for the
first baking in some smaller jar, so that the larger protion need not be opened so soon. Always shake the yeast before using."<br.

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Pretzels</b></font><br>
Most of the information on  the origin of one of America's favorite snack foods relies on popular
folklore rather than documented fact.
The history of hard-baked bread and flour goods actually begins in ancient times, when biscuits
(literally "twice baked") fueled the Roman legions. Food historians and Catholic scholars generally
agree that, from early times,  pretzels held a special place in Lent, a Christian period of abstinence
from eggs. Some sources trace the earliest known pretzel reference to a 5th century Vatican
manuscript (Codex 3867). The text is attributed to Virgil. This reference does not include a
recipe. <a href="foodbreads.html#softpretzels">Soft pretzels & mustard </a> are Philadelphia traditions. 
<a href="foodbreads.html#chocolatepretzels">Chocolate covered pretzels</a> were introduced in the 1930s. Modern <a href="foodbreads.html#pretzelbread">
Pretzel Bread</a> surfaces in the 1990s.
<p>
When the Romans conquered Europe they brought with them recipes, ingredients and cooking
techniques.
The bread made in Southern France/Northern Italy around 610AD (the date often cited for the
"invention" of
the pretzel)  would likely have been similar in both technique and ingredients to loaves produced
by Ancient
Roman bakers. Many different kinds of breads were made at that time, of various flavors and
grains. The
crispness of the finished product is a function of oven temperature and baking time. 
<p>
<b>Why is it called a pretzel?</b><br>
There are three theories:
<p>
"The German word [bretzel,pretzel] comes ultimately from tha hypothetical medieval Latin
*brachiatellum, a
diminutive form of brachitum, bracelet'; it hence means etymologically ring-shaped biscuit'.<br>

them a favorite accompaniment to alcoholic drinks throughout northern Europe. Two basic
varieties are made from the same dough: the thin, hard type are baked; the thicker, bagel-like

named
Jochem Wessel was arrested for using good flour to make pretzels to sell to the Indians at a time
when his
white neighbors were eating bran flour. The first mention of the word "pretzel" in American print
was about
1824, and the first commercial pretzel bakery in the United States was set up in 1861 by Julius
Sturgis and

"Enloe, who has been working the streets for eight years, buys his pretzels from Gus Koebbe, whose shop is advertised by a sidewalk sign reading, "Gus' Pretzel Shop. Twisting Since 1920." Koebbe, a third-generation pretzel maker who has studied pretzel history, says he knows of only two other cities - New York and Philadelphia - where pretzels are sold on the street. His grandfather started the business in his basement and relied on his skills as a vendor to keep it going. Koebbe bought the store from his father in 1980. His 14 workers turn out about 6,000 pretzels daily in the stick and twisted varieties. He has also added the "bratzel," a quarter-pound bratwurst wrapped in pretzel bread."<br>

However, it was the training be received from an old Alsatian baker there that was to change the course of his life. Niangadou's style of bread-making -- yeast- and chemical-free -- earned him a celebrity following at E.A.T.'s and Burke & Burke in New York between 1986 and 1994 and led to his arrival in Atlanta last year as Olympic consultant and, eventually, as executive head baker at Buckhead Bread Company, where he directs production of more than 10,000 loaves a day, three-fourths of which are eaten in the city's restaurants.

"Twist this: Baking experts say pretzel bread a cousin of the ubiquitously popular crispy, salted snack is growing in popularity, popping up on menus and in sandwich orders from California bakeries to New York restaurants. 
The centuries-old chewy German bread with its doughy consistency and salted crust is "almost in that trend phase where youre seeing it almost everywhere," said Tom Vaccaro, senior director of baking and pastries at the Culinary Institute of America, where pretzels are taught in classes. 
"It offers a lot of flavor components when you eat it," Vaccaro said. "For a lot of people its in that comfort food zone, meaning a lot of people as children, as kids went to fairs, went to baseball games, football games, where you had pretzels for sale." 
So it wouldnt be that much of a jump for customers to order a pretzel bread sandwich, said Peter Reinhart, baking instructor at Johnson and Wales University in Charlotte, N.C. 
"Its not something thats so out of the box that no ones heard of it," Reinhart said. "We know that pretzel goes well with mustard, so it makes a good base for a sandwich." 
Florian Pfahler started Hannahs Bretzel (he says in his native Germany pretzel is spelled with a "b") in 2004 and has two Chicago locations with plans for more. His goal is to bring pretzel bread from Germany to the United States and says he has earned a loyal following. 
"What I hear time and again is, This is a tasty sandwich," Pfahler said. "The pretzel bread tastes so good." 
The restaurant also offers bragels (pretzel bagels) for morning sandwiches, pretzel-shaped pretzel bread and mini baguette-shaped pretzel bread for sandwiches...Corner Bakery Cafe, a restaurant chain based in Dallas, has had pretzel bread on the menu since the early 1990s and currently serves it as ham and turkey sandwiches, said Ric Scicchitano, the restaurants senior vice president of food and beverage.

<b>Chocolate covered pretzels</b><br>
Food historians trace the history of pretzels, in several forms back to Medieval times. Our 
survey of historic confectionery texts confirms the practice of dipping extant items into 
chocolate to achieve the "covered" effect began sometime in the mid 19th century and 
proliferated in the 20th. Early dipping items featured nuts (peanuts, pecans), fruits 
(pineapple, strawberries, cherries) and biscuits/biscotti. And then? There's 
<a href="foodcandy.html#chocolateants">Chocolate covered ants</a>.

The earliest print references we find for chocolate covered pretzels are from the 1930s. Not surprisingly, they come 
from the greater Philadelphia/Amish county, a region rich in pretzel history. We're not finding any particular person, 
place or company claiming to be the *inventor* or first to sell. In the late 1950s, some ads proclaim the product "new." BTW,

<b>Pullman loaves [aka Pain de mie, Pain Anglais, Sandwich bread]</b><br>

Our research confirms straight-edged "Pullman" loaves were served in dining cars manufactured by this company. It also reveals this type of bread existed long 
before both railroads and the company. The original reason for the perfectly symmetrical squared loaves was to minimize crust. This loaf was the bread of choice 
for decorative canapes, hors d'oeuvres, etc. Early loaves were made in several shapes in addition to rectangles. Mr. James Porterfield, railway dining expert, states
 Pullman selected this loaf for efficient storage purposes. This may be true. He also states this is the same sandwich bread we see today in our grocery stores. We 
think Julia Child, James Beard and Prosper Montagne would disagree. 
<p> 
According to Elizabeth David, European bread makers began using <a href="foodbreads.html#breadpans">square tin pans</a> in the early 18th century. 
<p>
<b>What is Pain de Mie?</b><br>
"Pullman Loaf or Pain de Mie. This is a white bread frequently used for sandwiches, a four-square loaf that has a delicate texture,
 a fine crumb, and good flavor. 
It is made in a special pan with a sliding lid at the top that keeps the bread in shape as it bakes."<br>
---<i>Beard on Bread</i>, James Beard [Alfred A. Knopf:New York] 1975 (p. 48)<br> [NOTE: this book includes a recipe.] 
<p>
"Pain de mie [White Sandwich Bread...] It is almost impossible in present-day America to find the firm, close-grained, evenly rectangular, unsliced type of white 
bread that is essential for professional-looking canapes, appetizers, and fancy sandwiches. In French this is pain de mie, meaning that the mie, the crumb or inside, is
 more important than the crust; in fact the crust exists merely as a thin and easily slided covering. French boulangeries form and bake the bread in special covered
 molds; the bread rises during baking so that it fills the mold completely and emerges absolutely symmetrical. The form can be round or cylindrical, but it is usually
 rectangular."<br>

shape variations.

"English or tin loaf. Pain Anglaise, dit aussi Pain de Mie--This bread is baked in France specifically for various culinary uses (croutons, white breadcrumbs, etc.) or 
for making sandwiches, canapes served as hors-d'oeuvre or for toast served with tea. English loaves can be of different shapes and weight. They are most
 frequently baked in rectangular tins, which makes it very easy to cut off the crust (used for making white breadcrumbs), Stale bread is often used. This type of loaf
 is also used for making hollowed-out croustades in which various ragouts, purees, etc., are served."<br>

<b>Rye bread</b><br>

Food historians generally agree that <a href="foodbreads.html#rye">rye</a> originated in Central/Eastern Europe. This hearty cold climate
grain sustained hungry humans for thousands of years. Rye cultivation probably began as an
accident. This makes it difficult to
pinpoint the exact date & place of the first loaf of rye bread. We are told the Ancient Greeks and
Romans knew rye bread but did not make much use of it. Rye bread, and related products, are
traditionally associated with the hungriest people of northern Europe. Recipes vary according to culture and cuisine.
Rye was introduced to the New World by European colonists. This grain flourished in New England.

<b>Rye: origin, dispersion & use:</b><br>
"Rye, secale cereale, a cereal which came into cultivation later than wheat, barley and oats. Rye
was for centuries the principal bread-making cereal of N. Europe, and still is in eastern parts of
the continent, especially in Russia. This is partly because it grows well in cold regions: well up
into the Arctic parts of Scandinavia and up to 4.250 m (14,000') in the Himalayas. It is not just a
northerly substitute for wheat, since it has its own special qualities and is preferred by some
people...The original ancestor of rye was a perennial grass, Secale montanum, common in N.
Africa and mountainous regions of the Near and Middle East, and known as mountain rye.
Probably around 3000 BC, somewhere in the highlands of E. Turkey, Armenia, and NW Iran,
where the harsh climate is unsuitable for wheat or barley, this was developed and cultivated into
an annual plant...Rye cultivation entered Europe from the east around 2000 BC and had spread
westwards to Germany by 1000 BC, skirting the lands where the classical civilizations were
developing...The first mention of its cultivation is in the 1st century BC by Pliny, who described
it as grown in the Alps and an unpleasant grain for only for the very hungry. However, the
Germanic tribes valued it. When the Anglo-Saxons invaded Britain they brought rye with them
and for a long time afterward more rye was grown in Britain than wheat. Bread was made from
pure rye flour and from <a href="foodbreads.html#maslin">maslin</a> (rye and wheat ground together);...Lower grades of bread were
made with mixtures of rye and barley and other grains."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 677-8)
<p>
<b>Cultivation:</b><br>
"There is evidence for the ancient cultivation of rye in the Near East dating back to the
Neolithic. Gordon Hillman...found cultivated rye in the aceramaic early Neolithic layers of Tell
Abu Hureyra in Neolithic layers of Tell Abu Hasan III in central Anatolia. Hillman reports that
there were entire rachis internodes at these sites, proof that the selective pressures of cultivation
were operating, because only a plant with a nonbrittle rachis can be harvested efficiently. It is
not clear, however, if rye was actually cultivated at these Neolithic sites or whether the plant
only underwent such morphological adaptations while being sown and harvested as a weedy
contaniment of other crops...Possibly this process of unintentionally cultivating rye, while
intentionally cultivating wheat and barley, also took place in the early Neolithic fields of Tell
Abu Hureyra and Can Hasan III that Hillman investigated. So we do not know if rye was
deliberately grown as a crop in its own right or if it was only "wheat of Allah." ...Rye reached
Europe at the dawn of the region's Neolithic Revolution, but probably as a weed. Angela M.
Kreuz...has discovered rye remains in Bruchenbrucken, near Frankfurt, in central Germany...A
detailed study for an area in northern Germany has shown that the shift to rye cultivation took
place during the second century A.D....During the Middle Ages, rye became a very important
crop in many parts of Europe...In conclusion, although rye has been said to be our "oldest crop,"
and baking comapny advertisements call rye bread the traditional bread...this is certainly not the
case. Only gradually did this crop, which began as a weed among cultigens, grow to
prominence."<br>

<b>Linguistic evidence:</b><br>
"Failing arechaeological proofs, Eureopean languages show an early knowledge of rye in German, Keltic, and Slavonic countries. The
principal names...belong to the peoples of the north of Europe...The pirign of this name must date...from an epoch previous to
the separation of the Teutons from the Lithuano-Slavs...Thus historical and philological data show that the species probably had its
origin in the countries north of the Danube, and that its cultivation is hardly earlier than the 
Christian era in the Roman empire, but perhaps more ancient in Russia and Tartary."<br>

conditons of soil and climate, but better conditions in Britain meant that settlers sould indulge their preference for other
crops. Ergot would have flourished in the damper conditions prevailing in England, and this may have been the major factor in

"Thin flatbread, baked directly on hot embers, was probably the only bread most Icelanders knew up unti the late eighteenth century.

that fuel-intensive ovens were not built; all baking was done on embers, or on stone or iron plated placed over or by an open
fire. The flatbread ws probably baked from barley in Viking times but in the eighteenth century, rye flour was being 
used. for the bread, now made commercially...Rye flatbread with butter and thin slices of smoked lamb is a very traditional Icelandic treat which is often

" 'You don't have to be Jewish to love Levy's rye'--or any rye bread, for that matter. That you don't have to be Russian or Polish
is more to the point. Rye needs a cold climate and was never grown in ancient Israel. It originated as a weed in parts of Asia where
wheat was cultivated thousands of years ago. From here it was probably brought to northern Europe. Although rye 'n injun, made from 
rye and cornmeal, was the staple bread of the early American colonists, it as Russian-Jewish bakers at the turn of the century
and later advertising techniques that made rye bread so popular. The earliest bread prepared by the Jews was made of flat cakes baked
between layers of slow-burning camel dung, as in the Book of Ezra. They also parched the grain, like the reapers in the Book'
of Ruth. If they had a hearth, they roasted the dough in the ashes. When the Jews settled down and began baking bread, they baked 
well. Their best bread was of wheat kemach solet, 'essence of flour,' from which they made Temple sacrifices to God and bread for
the rich. Barley was used by the poor and for horse feed. To make barley palatable, ground lentils, beans, and millet were added. 
At first, Jewish housewives and their daughters tended the ovens; later maid-servants helped. Later still, when Jews became
city dwellers, men became bakers. In Jerusalem there is still a baker's street in the Old City. The first breads were small round
loaves slightly raised int eh center and about as thick as a finger. Three breads per person were eaten at each meal. Thus, at the
meal Abigail prepared for David and his men, she served two huge jugs of wine and two hundred loaves of bread. Rye bread, often 
considered inferior to wheat, is sometimes not eaten on holidays. But during the week of Hanukkah it is perfectly acceptable with 
a hearty vegetable soup. Black bread--rye bread made from dark, coarsely ground flour--is what poor Russian Jews ate during the 
week, with hallah or white bread for the Sabbath. American rye is lighter, so we need coffee, cocoa, or blackstrap molasses to a
achieve the desired dark effect. It takes an expert to prepare excellent rye bread. Rye flour is harder to handle than wheat.
The dough is stickier, more difficult, and must be kneaded longer."<br>

<a name="maslin">
<b>Maslin</b><br>

The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> defines "maslin" as a "Mixed grain, esp. rye mixed with wheat. Also,
bread made of mixed corn." The word derives from Old French "mesteillon" which in turn derives
from Latin "miscere," to mix. The oldest reference to this word in English print dates to 1303.
There are many spelling variations throughout the years. 
Maslin bread, as is true with most European foods made with <a href="foodbreads.html#rye">rye</a>, was the food of the
common/poorer people. Wealthy people ate bread composed solely of wheat. The wealthier the
person, the finer the wheat. Maslin was also used to make other foods too, such as pottage.
<p>
"The cereals of the early medieval period were those already known in Britain. It is possible that
the Saxons grew proportionately less wheat than their predecessors in Roman times raised in
their continental homelands. They certainly favored the mixed crop of wheat and rye that was later
called maslin (from miscelin, its name in the Merovingian and Carolingian domains of France; the
Saxon term for it was later corrupted to mancorn or monkcorn.  The mixed crop was well
regarded, as it had been in prehistoric times, for it acted as an insurance against the failure of
wheat on its own in a bad season. But when wheat was grown where soil and climate would bear
it; and the ninth century saw not only Viking invasions, but also more peaceful trading expeditions
from Norway, when the Norsemen came to England to purchase surplus wheat."<br>
---<i>Food and Drink in Britain From the Stone Age to the 19th Century</i>, C. Anne Wilson [Academy
Chicago:Chicago] 1991 (P. 235)
<p>
"In the Middle Ages white wheaten bread of the finest quality only appeared on the tables of the
well-to-do...The lord of the manor could render his own land more fertile by having it marled and
dunged. But it was not worth the labour of the small peasant to dig, cart, and spread the clayey
marl on his strips in the openfield, when these would shortly be realloted to neighbours. So they
remained unimproved, and the villagers grew maslin, rye or barley on land that might, with
attention, have been made to produce wheat. Even maslin soon degenerated, after a few poor
seasons, into something approaching pure rye.  All wheat on damp soil is changed after the third
sowing into 'siligo', Columella had written in the first century AD. He was referring to a
phenomenon that occurred when hard and soft wheats were grown as a mixed crop and siligo (a
soft white wheat) fared better in moist conditions. But owing to a confusion of words siligo was
later taken to mean  'rye', and the medieval farmer believed, in accordance with his experience with
maslin, that wheat and rye were different manifestations of the same cereal; though he noticed
that the change took place in one direction only, and was irreversable. So maslin was raised as a
breadcorn akin to wheat, thought its proportions must have varied from season to season and
from village to village. It was grown in the first place as a safeguard, lest pure wheat should fail,
and in the second place because it was a heavier producer than wheat alone. For these reasons it
still had a high reputation as late as the seventeenth century. Clean rye was also grown, and was
mixed with wheat at the mill in whatever proporitons were desired to produce maslin meal...verses
by Thomas Tusser explain the great drawback of maslin: the rye ripened anything up to a fortnight
earlier than the wheat, and if it was left to stand, began to shed its grain. The compromise
solution, when both were sown together, was to cut the maslin in the middle week, after the pure
rye harvest, but before that of wheat; and such was still the practice in the seventeenth century." <br>

<b>Semolina</b><br>
Semolina is not a food in itself. It is an edible starch created during the process of milling grain. In modern times, semolina is generally made from 
Durham wheat, a "hard wheat" descending from ancient Emmer. In days past, semolina was not limited to any particular kind of wheat grain. While semolina was 
likely known at the dawn of civilization, print recipe evidence dates to the middle ages. Tracing the diffusion of this food requires the services of forensic botanists 
and linguistic experts. Contemporary Americans generally equate semolina with pasta. Back in the day this grain was amazingly versatile.
<p>
<b>What is semolina?</b><br>
"Semolina consists of the small hard particles of wheat left in the bolting machine after the fine flour has passed through its 
meshes. It forms the basis of all Italian pastes from the finest vermicelli to the large type of macaroni called Zitoni. It also makes 
quite agreeable milk puddings. Another more creamy variety of semolina is made from maize or Indian corn." <br>

of wheat.]
<p>
"Semolina is usually made from the very hard durum wheat, a variety of Mediterranean origin which is now grown mostly in the 
USA and Canada. When coarsely milled, the brittle grains fracture into sharp chips, and it is these which constitute ordinary semolina." <br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson, 2nd edition, Tom Jaine editor [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2007 (p. 711) 
<p>
<b>Why do we call it semolina? </b><br>
"The word semonlina comes ultimately from Latin simila, which signified a kind of fine wheat flour (it is also the source of English 
simnel, as in simnel cake). This developed into Italian semola, 'grain', whose diminutive from somolino passed, with slight 
alteration, into English in the eighteenth century. It denotes the coarse particles left after wheat has been milled into flour and then sifted. In 
British cuisine semolina's commonest role has been in the making of rather uninspiring milk puddings...Eliza Acton gives a recipe for a 'good 
semolina pudding' in <i>Modern Cookery</i>, 1845, but it perhaps reaches its apotheosis in pasta and in gnocchi, small Italian dumplings often made 
from semolina." <br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford Univeristy Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 307) 
<p>
<b>How is semolina used in cookery? </b><br>
"...to [Italian] millers semolina is the major part, the heart of the endosperm, of the wheat berry, which provides the bulk of 
their flour. When first separated from the bran and the rest of the wheat offal...the semolina emerges in granules, of varying 
degrees of fineness, according to the methods by which it has been milled. When gound to an intensive degree, the result is the 
finest wheat flour. In stone milling...semolina is made 'by keeping the stones a little further apart than for flour-making, then 
carefully sifting the meal thus produced'...Semolina meals as we know them are not normally used in bread doughs. A confusion 
which may arise in the minds of those familiar with Italian pasta products...is...the use of the words semola or semlino di grano 
duro, or hard-wheat semolina, which appear on the packets of all the good Italian pasta products. To make pasta which will 
dry successfully, without splintering, and cook firmly rather than collapsing into mush, an exceptionally hard-grain, high-gluten 
variety of wheat called durum is used; and because flour in semolina form absorbs less water than the finely ground product it 
makes a dough which dries out quickly. This makes it preferable for mass-manufactured pasta, although it is the durum wheat 
itself which is the really important factor in commercial pasta products...The semolina meals we buy in packets from the 
grocer vary in degrees of fineness, and can be milled from any good hard wheat, not necessarily durums, but always high-gluten. 
The Italian words semola and semolino derive from simila, the Latin for fine flour--fine, that is, in the sense of best 
quality. Some people do...use semolina for home-made pasta...Durum wheat flours are considered too tough for breadmaking on 
their own, but are sometimes used for blending." <br>

<b>Spelt</b><br>

     "Spelt...The place of origin of spelt (Triticum spelta), a hardy wheat, is a matter of some debate,
     with some experts suggesting Iran about 6000 to 5000 B.C.; other arguing for two independent
     sites, one in Iran and the second in southeastern Europe; and still others who would have spelt
     emerging only in Europe and at a later date. In any case, spelt was cultivated throughout the Near
     East, Europe, and the Balkans during the Bronze Age (4000 to 1000 B.C.) and , along with einkorn
     and emmer, it is another of the ancestors of modern wheat. Spelt was probably an important cereal
     of the ancient Egyptians and Greeks and seems to have been a staple of the Romans, in which case
     the latter people may have facilitated the grain's spread northward to Germany and Switzerland and
     westward to Spain, where it was still being grown at the beginning of the twentieth century.
     Complicating the picture, however, are the finds of  spelt remains dating from 3800 to 2800 B.C.
     in Neolithic sites in Spain, western Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium--but whether these are
     the remains of domesticated spelt are another matter. Vandals have been credited with introducing
     spelt in Europe around the fifth century A.D.  Both, whenever and wherever spelt was established,
     the grain became a major cereal crop in Europe and joined einkorn and emmer in sustaining
     multitudes duirng the Middle Ages. Around the middle of the nineteenth century (if not before),
     spelt was carried to North America, where production (much of it for fodder) peaked in the early
     decades of the twentieth century. Spelt is grown today on a small scale in isolated parts of
     Germany and Switzerland, and it seems to be making a comeback in the United States and Canada
     because of the health-food market."<br>

<b>Sally Lunn</b><br>
The story of Sally Lunn is a delightful tale of culinary folklore. Notes here:
<p>
"Sally Lunns are large buns or teacakes made with a yeast dough including cream, eggs, and
spice. They are generally supposed to take their name from a late eighteenth-century baker, Sally
Lunn, who according to W.J. France in <i>Up-to-date Breadmaking</i> (1968) had a pastry cook's shop
in Lilliput Alley in Bath. The earliest source of the story seems to be William Hone's <i>Every-day
Book</i> (1827):  The bun...called the Sally Lunn originated with a young woman of that name in
Bath, about 30 years ago. She first dried them...Dalmer, a respectable baker and musician,
noticed
her, bought a business, and made a song in behalf of Sally Lunn.' Although the  30 years' seems
to be an understatement, this in not inconsistent with the first two recorded reference to the word:
in Philip Thickenesse's <i>Valetudinarian's Bath Guide</i> (1780)...and the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>
(1798)...However, there exists a French cake of Alsatian origin called solilem or solimeme which
is fairly similar to the Sally Lunn...and it may be that both Sally Lunn and solimem derive
ultimately from French soleil lune,  sun and moon (cake), golden on top over a paler base. In the
southern states of the USA, the term Sally Lunn stands for a variety of yeast and soda breads."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 296-7)
<p>
"Sally Lunn [is] a major enigma for food historians. It is not that there is a doubt about what it
actually is...However, the derivation of the name is a subject which has excited many pages of
prose...Many authors remark that the French solilem is of Alsatian origin. It has, however, proved
difficult to find corroboration of this in French books about Alsatian cuisine or French reference
works generally...The earliest French reference which has come to light is in Careme (1815).
This
is long after the Sally Lunn was being cried in the streets of Bath, but just before Careme was in
England (1816, working at the Royal Pavilion in Brighton). So the hypothesis that Careme
 discovered' the Sally Lunn when he was in England and decided to make what was doubtless a
slightly adapated version of it, giving it a French name, does not work. <i>Kettner's Book of the
Table</i> by Dallas (1877) includes, however, a memorable salvo fired against Careme on the basis
is
that hypothesis...The persuasiveness of this prose is undimmed after more than 100 years. In
default of further evidence, such as researchers in Alcase have recently searched for in vain, it is
tempting to assume that Kettner had it more or less right, although a mystery remains: how did
Careme learn about the Sally Lunn before he set foot in England?"<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 684)
<p>
<b>Original text from <i>Kettner's Book of the Table</i>:</b><br>
"Sally Lunn is an honored name from the Land's End to John o'Groat's. But why should the
reader be called to meditate upon her virtues in these pages, in which so little has been said about
the Bath bun, the Banbury cake, the Scotch shortbread, the Brioche, the Baba, the Savarin, the
Gauffre, and many other noble thing? The reason is that her name has been mixed up with a little
culinary scandal; and it is necessary to vindicate her fair fame. The greatest cook of modern
times,
Careme, came over to England to minister to the palate of the Prince Regent. He did not stay
long, but he stayed long enough to appreciate the charms of Sally Lunn and her ever memorable
cake. He was a great cook, but a fearful coxcomb--and immeasurable egotist. If ever he made the
slightest change in a dish, he vaunted the variation as an original idea, and thenceforward set up
as
the soverign creator of the dainty. So it was that he dressed up Sally Lunn a little, and presented
her to the Parisian world as his nown--his Solilemn. The fact might well be forgotten, but here
are
stupid asses who will not let us forget it. They come over to England; they send up, among the
sweets of a dinner, Sally and her teacake, rigged out int eh height of French fashion; and like an
English dancer or singer who insists on Mademoiselle to her name, the good hones Sally that we
know is announced as the imcomparable Solilemne."<br>

<p>
<b>How to make a Sally Lunn? Elizabeth David observes:</b><br>
"There are...numerous methods for baking the cake--in one large hoop, in two or more smaller
ones to produce muffin-size cakes, in a cake tin, or shaped by hand and put into the oven on a
baking sheet. This latter method would be difficult with today's Sally Lunn recipes, which
produce too soft a dough for a hand-shaping. Another possibility is to use a decorated kugelhopf
or turban mould...This produced an effective-looking cake, and if it is then no longer quite an
English Sally Lunn--well, Miss Acton does quite firmly call it a French cake.<br>

"A Solimemne.</b><br>
A rich French breakfast cake, or Sally Lunn.<br>
From three-quarters of a pound of flour take three ounces for the leaven, and make it into a lithe
paste with half an ounce of solid, well-washed yeast..., mixed with two or three tablespoonsful of
just warm cream, or new milk; throw a cloth over and leave it near the fire to rise for about half
an hour, or until it is twice the original size. In the interim make a hollow in the centre of the
remainder of the flour, and put into it a quarter of an ounce of fine salt, once ounce of pounded
sugar, the yolks of four fresh eggs, four ounces of lukewarm butter, and a couple of
tablespoonsful of cream, also warm. Mix the whole gently and carefully into a perfectly smooth
paste, flatten it with the hand upon the dresser, spread the leaven over it, and blend them
thoroughly with light kneading, as directed for brioche paste...The whole should be of the same
colour throughout.       
     Next, put it into a small, well-butttered copper stewpan or plain cake-mould, and let it remain
in a moderately warm place until it has risen, like the leaven, to double its original size; then with
a paste-brush or feather wash the top with beaten egg, and without disturbing it, set it into a
tolerably quick oven, and bake it nearly or quite an hour; but do not allow it to be too deeply
coloured. Turn it from the mould, cut it once or twice asunder, and pour over the slices plenty of
good butter, just dissolved in a small saucepan; put the cake together again, and serve it
immediately. It may be converted into an excellent entrements by spreading currant, or other fine
jelly, or preserve, quickly upon it when it is cut, and sifting sugar thickly on the top after it is
restored to its proper form: it its then called a Dresden cake. We think that when left until cold
and toasted, the solimemne is even better than when served hot. It will be many hours rising;
sometimes as many as six or eight. If wanted for breakfast it should be made over night.<br>
     Flour 3/4 lb; yeast, 1/2 oz; little cream; salt, 1/4 oz.; sugar, 1 oz; yolks of eggs, 4; butter, 4 oz.:

"Sally Lunn</b><br>
Sally Lunn is among the aristocrats of Southern breads, a rich egg bread resembling brioche in its delicacy. This loaf found its
original fame in England, most say at a spa of Bath, taking on the name of a tea-shop proprietress. There's little or no
evidence for this nice story, but it's prettier than seeing the name as a corruption of solimeme, a simliar Alsatian bread. 
Corruption does occur with time, though, and what has happened to the elegant Sally Lunn in the past century is shameful. A fast 
little cupcake all puffed up with baking powder and sweetened beyond good taste masquerades under the grande dame's name. The
recipes here should restore the original's deserved respectability. The proportion of ingredients for Sally Lunn is close to that of Pain de Babeurre, with the addition of 4 eggs. The extra

<b>SALT-RISING BREAD</b><br>
Nostalgic American cooking literature often refers to "old fashioned salt rising bread." What was this stuff and "old timey" was it? Our survey of historic literature
(newspapers, magazines, cook books) confirms the existance of "salt rising bread" in the early 19th century. Early recipes suggest it was a "make do" alternative to traditional
yeast (barm) bread. A closer examination reveals a world of interesting facts, political agenda, and some fakelore.
<p>
<b>What is "salt rising bread?"</b><br>
<i>The Oxford Engish Dictionary</i> defines it thusly:<br>
salt-rising bread, n.
Etymology:  < salt n.1 + rising n. (compare rising n. 10a) + bread n.(Show More)
N. Amer. A type of bread made with a base of cornmeal, salt, and milk or water, which rises as a result of the action of a bacterium found in cornmeal.
1854   Trans. Michigan State Agric. Soc. 5 73   Mrs. J. L. Stout, Troy, 2 loaves salt rising bread.
1865   H. B. Stowe House & Home Papers 236   Salt-rising bread."
<p>
<b>How is this bread different from other loaves?</b><br>
The primary differences are in the method of the bread. Traditional loaves used yeast (bakers, barm, commerical). <a href="foodbreads.html#sourdough">Sourdough</a>
required starter saved from previous loaves. Salt rising bread depends entirely upon spontaneous natural fermentation. Historic recipes below confirm this bread required
an entirely different culinary knowledge set than standard bread. Unlike standard bread that can be forgiving with regards to flour quality, timing and baking, 
a salt rising loaf demanded quality ingredients, experience with temperatures, and perfect timimg. The end result was a pure white, solid loaf with 
light brown crust. 
<p>
<b>Was salt rising bread really popular in the pioneer days?</b><br>
Our research indicates yes. American newspapers published in the 1850s-1890s confirm salt rising bread was a staple category in fairs and community food competitions. 
In <a href="foodbreads.html#saltrisingfight">1889</a>, a rukus over the winning loaf turned a peaceful Ohio county fair competition into a brawl. Other articles suggest the 
popularity of this bread was confined to specific regions. Most notably: the South, Appalachian region, and upper midwest. Proponents of salt rising bread gloried in 
its flavor, purity, and superiority over commerical yeast and bakery products. One also senses homemaker pride in producing the perfect loaf. Naysayers disliked the 
flavor, calling it "cheesy" and frowned upon women who refused to purchase the latest products.
<p>
<b>The nostalgia factor</b><br>
Nostalgia for "good old fashioned salt rising bread the way our grandmothers made it" first surfaces after the Civil War. This period was known food flux:
Supplies were short, new commercial companies were launched (think: Fleischmann's Yeast), industrialization took hold (mass-produced bakeries), and families were uprooted
(old homesteads destroyed, conestoga wagon trains). Even families who stayed put faced changes in how they provisioned, cooked and dined. The next wave of nostalgia
hit in the late 1890s, when letters to the editor bemoaned the current state of commercial bread and longed for mother's salt rising loaves. In 1909, salt rising bread
became a central symbol of "old fashioned" goodness in a Kansas Governor's electcion campaign. Loaf nostalgia variously popped up in the 20th century. Generally
in newspaper and magazine "recipe request" columns. Answers generally reflect the responder's direct knowledge (via family, we suppose) of this type of bread. 
<p>
<b>What makes researching salt rising bread such a challenge?</b><br>
Not only are the recipes different, but so are the names. We discovered these search terms in the course of our research: salt-rising bread, salt risen bread,
salt raised bread, salt breaad, salt risen yeast, salt rising yeast, and bread without yeast. Certainly there are scores of additional alternative names. A careful 
examination of ingredients and method will confirm where the recipe falls. In the late 20th century some recipes include thinly shaved potato. One is reminded that
<a href="foodbreads.html#potato">potato yeast/bread</a> was a recipe in its right along side of salt-rising bread. The overlap and evolution invites additional research.

Salt Rising, or Yeast.</b><br>
This kind of yeast will be found convenient when you get out of the other kinds; it does not rise quite so soon as the hop yeast, yet it makes excellent bread. Make a quart of water lukewarm, stir into it a table-spoonful of salt, and make it a tolerably thin batter with flour; mix it well, sprinkle on the top a handful of dry flour, and set it in a warm place to rise, but be sure you do note let it get hot, or it would spoil it. Turn it round occasionally, and in a few hours it will be light, and the top covered with bubbles; then make up your bread into rather a soft dough, adding as much lukewarm water as will be found necessary; grease and flour your ovens well, set them where they will keep a little warm till the bread rises and looks very light, and bake it as other light bread. The softer is the dough, the more light and spongy will the bread be.<br>

"We have read several homilies lately upon the question of the best and moost economical way of insuring good bread. hat procured from dealers being almost invariably made from 
mixed, if not damaged flour, and usually more or less soured before it can be consumed. The inconvenience, and with present servants, almost impossibility of having bread
baked a home, necessitates its purchase from bakers. Home-made bread is one of the luxuries of the past in most households, and while every one is willing to acknowledge its
superior excellence, very few can explain in what particular respect the home-made article difers from that procured from the baker. Of late a new article of bread has
made its appearance, and wherever tried has invariably given satisfaction, and fo the simple reason that it is nothing more than the old-fashioned salt rising bread of the past
generation, made up and baked by the assistance of steam, thus saving an immensity of loss and trouble and always insuring an excellent article. The AEriated bread contains all the excellent qualities
 of salt-rising, or home-made bread, always being fresh and solid, retaining its sweet taste mucch longer than what is known as bakers bread."<br>

"A correspondent of <i>Household</i> gives the following receipt for making salt-rising bread, which is said to be superior to common yeast bread, and is considered by some as more wholesome.
'Put three teacups water, as warm as you can bear your finger in in a two quart cup or bowl, and three-fourths of a teaspoonful of salt; stir in flour enough to ake quite a stiff batter; this is for the rising, or emptyings, as some
call it. Set the bowl, closely covered, in a kettle, in warm water as 'warm as you can bear your finger in it' and keep it as near this temperature as possible. Notice the time when you 'set' your rising, in three hours stir in two tablespoons of flour, put it back, and in five and one-half hours from the time off setting, it wil be within one inch of the 
top of your bowl. It is then light enough and will make up eight quarts of flour; make a sponge in the center of your flour with one quart of water of the same temperature as 
rising, stir the rising into it; cover over with a little dry flour, and put it where it will keep very warm, but not scald; in the three-fourths of an hour mix this into a stiff dough; if water is used be sure it is very
warm, and do not work as much as yeast bread; make the loaves a little larger and keep it warm for another three-quarters of an hour; it will then be ready to bake. 
While rising this last time you have your oven heating; it needs a hotter oven than yeast bread. If these rules are followed, you will have read as white as snow, with a light brown crust deliciously sweet and tender."<br>

I make salt-rising bread by the following rule: One teaspoonful of salt, one of sugar; one quart of warm water so warm that you can just bear your hand in it, flour enough for a stiff batter. I put the yeast in a stone jar, and place the jar in a kettle of warm water where it will keep warm, but not hot enough to cook or scald, until it begins to rise, which will be in about four hours. Should the water rise on top of the batter, dont put more flour in, but stir briskly until it disappears. If it is set at 4 or 6 oclock, I can usually get it baked before 12. When it does begin to rise it will be but a few moments until it will run over, it comes up sp fast. The mix bread, only, you put it in the pans immediately.

The biggest premium at the Manchester Fair [OH] last week was $15 for the best loaf of salt-rising bread and it stirred up a big row. Nearly every woman in Adams County and many from adjoining counties who were at all versed in the culinary art must have tried for that blue ribbon, as there were loaves upon loaves piled up. The directors finally prevailed on some parties to assume the risk of tying the ribbon. After the premium was awarded it was discovered that one of the judges was related to the successful exhibitor, and of course this created a big racket. New judges had to be selected, and the ribbon was tied the second time. The unsuccessful exhibitors did not quiet down, however. They declared the judges didnt know anything about bread, now how! More than 100 families are at swords points, and at least one engagement has been declared off. Scarcely a day passes without a fight, and the whole county is worked up over the affair.<br>

Editor Post: Why does not some baker in this town learn how to make salt-rising bread and bake it? Why do they persist in making this sour stuff they sell for bakers bread? That man who has not eaten a toast made of sweet, delicious salt-rising light bread cannot read the Book of Ruth with any degree of edification, for I warrant that train Ruth gleaned in the field of Boaz never came in contact with hop yeast or alum baking powder, of which much of the stuff called bread in Washington is made. Staff of life, indeed! Bah! Beat biscuit are good, but they are not in it at all with genuine salt-rising breadlight bread as our mothers in old Virginia and Kentucky call it. It savors of the virgin wheat field, makes the process of digestion a delight, rather than a labor and a torture, and turns the business of catching into a luxury such as Lucullus dreamed of but never realized.

A revolution in breadmaking has taken place in Kansas, and Gov. Stubbs is responsible for it. During the campaign last fall in more than 100 speeches he extolled the virtues of old-fashioned slat-rising bread. He told his audience that the strength and endurance which enabled him to travel day and night in all kinds of weather was due to the fact that he ate salt-rising bread at home there times a day. He recounted hat al his meetings how he had persuaded his daughter, Miss Lenova Stubbs, to learn to make salt-rising bread, giving her presents to from time to time to encourage her. I did not matter if some of her batches failed to rise, he said; they were thrown out to the chickens and another trail made. He appealed to the women in his audiences to discard the old yeast plan of making bread and try salt-rising. Nothing will bring more love into the homethe kind that enduresthan salt-rising bread on the dining room table was the assurance the governor held out to the women who attended his meetings. Gov. Stubbs Democratic opponents and many Republicans treated this talk about salt-rising bread as a new brand of Kansas grand stand play to catch the women of the State. It has done more than that: it has set them baking salt-rising bread, and it is safe to say that in the last six months one-half of the women of the State have made the experimentIn talking to a crowd of his political friends a few days ago, Gov. Stubbs told them that he had gained more than a pound a month since he moved to Topeka with his family. He attributed his good health to salt-rising bread, the old-fashioned kind his Quaker mother used to bake when he was a boy on the farm in Douglas county.<br>

Salt-rising bread isnt made a great deal any more, except by persons in whose families it has been a favored food for many years. It is much different from yeast bread. The leavening agent is a gas producing bacillus which may  be present in flour, cornmeal, or in the air. The texture is heavy, the crumb is moist, and the flavor is somewhat cheesy. Addicts to this bread consider it perfectly delicious. There is a disagreeable odor while the dough is undergoing fermentation, but this disappears during baking. Chance is an important element in making salt-rising bread. We can be pretty certain about yeast breads, for we know the fermentative action of yeast, but we can only hop and guess that the bacteria which produce gas for unyeasted bread are present and will do their work. Experimenters have found that hot, dry, weather usually is favorable to these bacteria. After heavy rains success has been rare. Salt-rising bread is made from a starter. The organism is coddled along in a liquid medium until it starts its gas formation. Then the dough is made.
<p>
<b>Salt-Rising Bread</b><br>
(One loaf)<br>
1 cup milk<br>
2 tablespoons white cornmeal<br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>
1 tablespoon sugar<br>
1 tablespoon butter or lard<br>
Flour for a stiff dough<br>
Bring milk to the boiling point and cool to lukewarm. Add cornmeal, salt, and sugar. (Some cooks omit the sugar at this time, adding it with the flour. They think 
sugar detrimental to the growth of the organism. This point has been disputed.] Place this mixture in a tall pitcher or fruit jar and surrounded by water at 120 
degrees, which is hot to the hand. This is a higher temperature than that used for yeast breads, it will be noted. Allow to stand for about seven hours or until it 
shows signs of fermentation. Gas may be heard as it escapes at this point. If the ferment can be kept warm it may be allowed to rise overnight. Add melted butter or 
lard and one cup of flour. Beat thoroughly and let ferment again, surrounded by water at 120 degrees. When very light, gradually add more flour until the dough is 
soft but doesnt stick. Knead for about ten minutes. Experiments have been shown that about 100 kneading strokes, on the average, produce the best bread, but this 
depends somewhat upon the vigor with which kneading is done. Place in a greased pan and allow to rise until about two and a half times its original bulk. Bake as you
 would yeast bread, in a hot oven, 400 degrees, for about an hour. Do not expect the loaf to look like yeast bread. It probably will not rise above the top of a 
standard size bread pan. It will be heavy and solid. That is its nature. As I have implied, salt-rising bread is temperamental and no directions, however explicit or 
complete, can assure perfect results, even when followed to the letter. You may get fine, prize taking results, and again you may meet only with disappointment. Many 
cooks think that one success is worth several failures, however, and follow the If at first you dont succeed policy with their breadmakingIf the fermentation 
takes place to slowly the bread may sour.<br>

Let rise until very light. Then gradually add about 3  cups of flour, until dough is stiff enough to be kneaded. Knead for 15 minutes. Shape into two loaves, place in greased bread pans, brush top with melted butter, cover and let rise until very light. (Here inexperienced cooks beware. It should more than double, I think.)

"Salt-rising bread is one of the oldest breads in this country. It has a delicious and unusual flavor and a very smooth texture. In fact, it is one of the most 
remarkable of all breads. It does present one great difficulty for the breadmaker. It is unpredictable. You may try the same recipe without success three or four 
times and find that it works the fifth time. Or you may bet a loaf that is halfway good. If it works, fine; if it doesn't, forget it. I am including it in this 
collection because it is a worthy recipe, but I do so with a warning that you may be disappointed. To keep the starter at a steady temperature, which the recipe 
requires, leave it in an electric oven with the light on--this will provide just enough warmth--or in a gas oven with the pilot light on. In the old days it used to
 be kept in hot water for 25 hours, the bowl covered with quilts. The foam that forms may not be one, two, or three inches in thickness, but if it foams at all make 
the loaf and see what happens. Good luck!"<br>

Salt-rising bread is another of those regions American dishes for which some people have a passion and which inspire in others something short of aversion. The 
bread is made by a natural fermentation, and for a period it is a bit malodorous. The finished product is a bit tangy with a flavor that is at times described as 
cheese-like.<br>

potatoes as the fermentation product, and Nelle Keys Bell of Indianapolis wrote to protest 'that no real cook would add potatoes except in an emergency situation.' 'It

What is sourdough? Ed Wood, sourdough expert, states:
<br>
"A true sourdough is nothing more than flour and water with wild yeast to make it rise and special
bacteria to provide the flavor."<br>

<p>
<b>Old World sourdough</b><br>
"...if truth be told, the Old West was not responsible for the birth of sourdough. Sourdough
started with the discovery of leavening agents by Egyptians about five thousand years ago.
Through painstaking experimentation, Egyptians developed an active starter for a new, wildly
popular beverage--beer. During the same millenium, an enterprising baker tried mixing a
particularly heavy bacteria-laden starter sample with flour and water, creating the first leavened
bread. A new industry was born. It was such a resounding success that the use of these wondrous
sour yeast cultures spread rapidly through the Old World...Just a century ago, sourdough starter
was still one of the most reliable sources for yeast cultures in the world. Old West residents from
miners to ranchers made sourdough products daily...Starter is the heart of the sourdough process.
A small amount of starter added to a bowl of regular bread mix becomes the ringleader of change,
quickly preading its hosted, harmless bacteria among fresh ingredients...Each starter has its own
characteristic taste and smell...Many older starters are guarded by their owners as if they were a
key to heaven. They are passed on generation to generation and rarely shared."<br>

<b>Gold rush grub & sourdough starters: California & Yukon territory</b><br>
"Sourdough is a dough made of flour and water fermented without years for baking bread. It is the leaven of the Bible, part of the 
fermented dough set aside to start fermentation another time in a new batch of flour and water. Largely, the word came
into the American vocabulary at the time of the rush to the Klondike in the Yukon Territory of Northwest Canada in 1897-1989, the
second great gold rush in our history. Because hardy prospectors carried sourdough in firkins or pots on their persons to sustain
fermentation under whatever circumstances in the frozen north, this flavorful ingredient of the staff of life became so
valued and characteristic the word was extended in meaning to personify searchers in the northlands, especially Alaskans, surviving
old-timers of the rush...A short time after James Marshall discovered gold in the American River in 1848, San Francisco began to 
be a city of varied ethnic groups. Streaming back to The City to splurge their dust on pleasures...Forthy-Niners found the
sourdough bread they had eaten in the mountains on tables in San Francisco. Most of those who joined the Gold Rush were not miners, 
knowing little of the processes of extracting gold from the earth...Gold-mining was an old trade in Mexico, the methods and
processes in use there being brought to northern California...Along with the Mexican miners came their sourdough."<br>
---"Sourdough and French Bread," Peter Tamony, <i>Western Folklore</i>, October 1973 (p. 265)
<p>
"With the advent of commercially available yeast and baking powder in the
nineteenth century, the use of such starters was confined to those pioneers who moved farther and
farther from settlements. These included the gold prospectors of nothern California in the 1850s
and the Yukon in the 1890s. The first sourdough purveyor in San Francisco, called the French
Bakery, opened the year the Gold Rush began--1849--and it was because of the bread's
popularity among miners that "sourdough" became the slang term for the prospectors themselves,
and later, by extension, all Alaskans. Because many of these prospectors set out by boat from San Francisco, sourdough bread is often associated with that city to this day, and it is still a San
Francisco specialty."<br>

"Perhaps no foodstuff is more closely associated with West Coast gold rushes than

of a prospector's cabin...Sourdough's active ingredient, sourdough starter, is a versatile leaven,
capable of energizing flapjacks, biscuits, and even chocolate fruitcake, in addition to the daily loaf.
Keeping starter alive is a way to avoid having to create starter each time the cook wants to bake
with yeast. A method for manufacturing powdered yeast was not patented until 1854...However,

<b>The French connection?</b><br>
Food historians confirm <a href="foodbreads.html#frenchsourdough">French sourdoughs</a> enjoy a special place at the table. This tradition
flourished in the New World.<p> 
"Because good sourdough French bread was the usual run of many bakeries in San Francisco it is difficult to detail the rise of its
myth and legend prior to the advent of newspaper columnists. In general, this holds that the dough must be leavened with a closely
guarded sponge, starter, or mother brought from Europe, preferably France, over a hundred years ago and passed from 
decade in the same bakeshop; that the loaves must be baked in brick ovens of a pattern long since disused and beyond the skillos of 
modern masons to recreate; that such ovens must be below sidewalk level at a precise by indefininate depth; that they must be fired
to a certain temperature by certain woods; and that the resultant baking must be cooled at a certain rate in air moistened by
San Francisco fog. Only when such complex elements are conjoined does the traditional sourdough French bread of San Fransico
take its place beside the Sacher torte of Vienna, the jambalaya of New Orleans, the onion soup of Paris. Bread baking...is an
ancient human art...The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>...records twelfth-century usage of sourdough (<i>Sauerteig</i>), the common 
denomination in Germanic languages, <i>levain</i> being French usage. For centuries the art of bread-making has been carried to its
highest level in Paris, leaven (or its synonyms, sponge, starter, and mother) and time being the basic ingredients of its
bread. The use of yeast appears to have died out in France, but was revived toward the end of the seventeenth century...
Since, yeast has been used by Parisian bakers for fancy bread and pastry only...During the Colonial Period French bakers emigrated
to Mexico, no doubt carrying the implements and ingredients of their trade...Through these years the leaven of Paris was
perpetuating itself, eventually to enliven the celebrated sourdough biscuit of the early-day ranches on the plains of Texas and
New Mexico. <p>
"Having lived in Texas and having fought in the Mexican War, George W. Keller arrived in California in 1848. In 1948 his daughter...related
stories of the early days of California told by her father. Tuolumne County records attest he bought the French Hotel in 
Sonora on 12 October 1849. As che recalls his words...'Baking was done in Dutch Ovens and often the bread or flapjacks were baked
in frying pans, the same as the miner did in his camps.'...Among the bakeries listed in the San Fransico City Directory fro 
1856 are the French Bakery, Beraud Freres, Deu's, Mme. Lantheaume, and Leagay & Co. Grocers of the first decades of this
century recall French bread and milk bread as equally best sellers...<p>
"In France bread is not called <i>French bread</i>, this being a naming for varied types in other places, as to San Fransicso the
referent being to the traditional length of the French loaf...Old-timers wonder at newspaper stories of French bread being
taken across country in batches, or being shipped afar, as a gourmet delight."<br>

<b>The Oakland counterclaim:</b><br>
"For years, San Francisco has laid claim to being the sourdough French bread capital of the United States...But now there is a stirring
from across the bay, a challenge to San Francisco to prove its claim and it comes from the unlikeliest of places--Oakland. A breadmaker
in Oakland, long considered by San Francisco to be just a scruffy industrial city with no redeeming social value, says that San 
Francisco is 'just making another glamour claim that it doesn't deserve.' Armed with figures he said would back him up, Robert J. Sciacqua,
president of the Colombo Baking Co., declared that the new sourdough French read capital of the country was Oakland..."<br>

<b>Where are the authentic sourdough recipes?</b><br>
19th century American cookbooks sometimes contain instructions for sourdough starter and
bread. They are hard to find because they listed under different names. Sourdough is revealed by
examining method and mode. One of the differences between traditional *sourdough* and regular
bread is not the type of leavening (in addition to traditional starters we find yeast-based recipes)
but the fact that the leavening is saved and employed in perpetuity. Most leavened breads, then as
today, are mixed quickly and baked as soon the sponge is ready. 18th and 19th century
cookbooks warn cooks not to mix up too much leaven ahead of time because it sours. They also
provide instructions regarding how to *fix* soured bread and preserve yeast longer by drying into
cakes. One popular 19th century cookbook author decreed:
<p>
"All bread that is sour, heavy or ill-baked is not only unpalatable, but extremely unwholesome,
and should never be eaten. These accidents so frequently happen when bread is made at home by
careless, unpractised or incompetent persons...Strong fresh yeast from the brewery should always
be used in preference to any others."<br>
---<i>Directions for Cookery in its Various Branches</i>, Eliza Leslie [Henry Carey:Philadelphia]
1852 (p. 376)
<p>
"Published in 1866, Jennie June's <i>American Cookery Book</i> does not use the term
"sourdough" although several of her recipes would be considered sourdough breads. Jennie
includes five methods for making yeast cakes that are dried in the oven or in the sun. This
demonstrates that in the years immediately after the California Gold Rush, manufactured yeast
was not always available...California claims the honor of originating sourdough bread. The
Boudin Bakery in San Francisco says that it has produced the "original" sourdough since Isidore
Boudin grought his starter...from Mexico in 1849, and mated that lively starter with French
baking technique...Over the course of its history, sourdough has been fermented with everything
from a starter based on unflavored yogurt to a combination of hops and potato water."<br>

<b>STICKY BUNS</b> (aka cinnamon rolls)<br>
Both cinnamon and bread (rolls) are ancient foods. When were they first combined? Where? What
did this first product taste like? Was it anything like the delicious, gooey Philadelphia-style sticky buns we
know today? Food historians have spent much time pondering origins. What we do know??! Is these items are "Old World"
gifts, likely originating in Northern Europe.
<p>
According to the food historians, cinnamon originated in Sri Lanka. The early history of this spice
is unclear. It is generally agreed that this spice was known to the ancient Greek and Roman
people. It was highly valued. The earliest uses seem to be as incense and flavoring in wine. The
ancient Roman recipes recorded by Apicius for sweet bread products do not include cinnamon;
they were spiced with pepper. Ancient Egyptian breads were sweetened with honey and flavored
with nuts.
<p>
Marco Polo (13th century) is credited for opening the spice trade (on a large scale) to Europe. 
Cinnamon and other spices were very expensive and highly prized by medieval cooks. They were 
incorporated into many dishes, both sweet and savoury. Indeed, spices were so popular they were
one of the main reasons for the "Age of Exploration." Columbus and other early explorers were
looking for a quicker route to the spice producing countries.
<P>
Modern cinnamon buns most likely descended from ancient galette and medieval fritters. Notes

"Dr. Ronald Wirtz [American Institute of Baking] has researched [sticky buns] in depth. He
begins, believe it or not, with the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, then moves forward in
time through Medieval Europe to present-day America. Wirtz follows the spice trade, specifically
that of cinnamon...Wirtz believes that our cinnamon roll or sticky bun owes "some of its origins to
British cooking and baking, perhaps with a degree of influence from the Dutch and Germans." He
points, in particular, to the Chelsea Bun, which Elizabeth David (<I>English Bread and Yeast
Cookery</i>, 1980) describes as "Sugary, spicy, sticky, square and coiled like a Swiss roll...a
pretty hefty proposition." The originals, made at least as far back as the early eighteenth century,
were apparently daintier...What I find particularly interesting in Wirtz's cinnamon-bun research is
his mention of Mathew Malzbender's <i>Practical Manual for Confectioners, Pastry-cooks,
Bakers and Candy Makers</i>, first published in Milwaukee in 1910 in both German and
English...The manual's directions for making cinnamon buns, according to Wirtz, call for a sweet
dough to be "sheeted out and sprinkled with sugar, cinnamon and currants, rolled up and slicked
just as in current practice." Also as in the preparation of Schnecken, Wirtz does on to say in the
<i>Retail Bakers Reference Book</i> (1928), Schnecken and "rolled up cinnamon buns" appear
on the same page...Hilda Lee suggests that Schnecken became popular among bakers in
Germantown, a Philadelphia suburb as early as the 1680s...No nineteenth- or early twentieth
century cookbook I searched mentions them...The earliest recipe for them I could find cropped up
in 1922 in <i>Good Housekeeping's Book of Menus, Recipes and Household
Discoveries</i>...According to Dr. Wirtz..."recent history of the U.S. saw fad popularity of
large-size caramelized cinnamon rolls, combining the size and make-up of the Chelsea bun with
the fillings and coatings of the rich Schnecken type roll.""<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Toast</b></font><br>

The history of toast may be divided in three parts: bread and it's role in human culture/cuisine,
toast recipes
through time, and the evolution of toasting methods. <a href="foodbreads.html#cinnamontoast">Cinnamon toast</a> &
<a href="foodfaq1.html#frenchtoast">French toast</a> are two popular iterations.
<p>
"Toast as everyone in Britain know, is made by placing a slice of bread in front of dry heat--a fire,
a grill, or
an electric toaster-until the surface browns and gives off an attractive smell...The true toast addict
is fussy
about its preparation...Toast is a standard part of  a proper English breakfast, together with a cup
of tea, it
forms a popular snack at any time...Certainly, toast has a long history in Britain.  "Tost"  was
much used in the
Middle Ages, being made in the ordinary way at an open fire. At this time sops--pieces of
bread--were used
to soak up liquid mixtures, and these were often first toasted, which reduced their tendency to
disintegrate.
Often toast was spread with toppings.  "Pokerounce"  was toast with hot honey, spice with
ginger, cinnamon,
and galingale.  "Tost rialle" was covered with a paste of sugar and rice flour moistened with sweet
wine and
including pieces of cooked quince, raisins, nuts, and spices, the whole thing covered with gilt
sugar
lozenges. A popular dish of the 17th century was cinnamon toast, which at that time was made by
covering
the toast with a paste of cinnamon and sugar moistened with wine. Early settlers in N. America
retained
their liking for it, and it became a traditional American dish. Meat toppings for toast became
fashionable
during the 16th century. At first they were sweetened: for exampale veal toasts were made with
choppe veal
kidney and egg yolks, sugar, rosewater, cinnamon, and ginger. Various other  hashes' based on
finely
chopped meat were served on toast. A trace of this practice survives in the serving of toast fingers
with plain
cooked minced meat, an adaptation made to the original dish in the 18th century. The
toast-and-something
habit has a long precedent in England. Towards the end of the 16th century all kinds of things
began to
appear on toast, such as poached eggs...buttered (scrambled) eggs; ham or bacon; anchovies; and
melted
cheese. All of them have remained associated with toast. The last achieved existence as a separate
dish
known as Welsh rabbit (or rarebit)....Toast with toppings became very popular as  savoury toast,
beloved of
the Victorians and Edwardians...Throughout the Middle Ages and early modern period, toast was
often
moistened in wine when making such dishes as toasted cheese, but at the end of the 17th century
it
became more usual to butter it. Hot buttered toast was eaten at breakfast. Later, when afternoon
tea
became the fashion, it appeared here too. The 1890s saw the arrival of Melba toast. This is
extraordinarily
thin toast and a technique for producing it is often attributed to Escoffier and Ritz..."<br>

"In <i>The Origin of Food Habits</i> (1944), H.D. Renner makes an attempt to explain the
English addiction to toast.  The flavour of bread', he says,  can be revived to some extent by re-warming and even new flavours are created in toasting.' This is very true, but leaves the most
important part unsaid. It is surely the smell of toast that makes it so enticing, and enticement
which the actuality rarely lives up to. In this it is like freshly roasted coffee, like sizzling bacon--all
those early morning smells of an intensity and deliciousness which create far more than those new
flavours, since they create hunger and appetite where note existed...'Village life', Renner
continues,  makes stale bread so common that toasting has become a national habit restricted to
the British Isles and those coutnries which have been colonized by Britian.'...I wonder if our open
fires and coal ranges were not more responsible than the high incidence of stale bread for the
popualrity of toast in all classes of English household. For toasting bread in front of the fire and
the bars of the coal-burning range there were dozens of different devices...Buttered toast is, then,
or was, so peculiarly English a delicacy."<br>

"The complexity of colonial hearth toasters reflected the culinary importance of toast, particularly
among colonists from Great Britain. Set before the fire, the most elaborate toaster held several
pieces of bread in an open, four-legged, wrought iron rack. Kick toasters were used for browning
both sides of the bread...In the 1890s stovetop toasters were made of perforated sheet iron and
had wire supports for bread on four pyramidal sides...Electric heating elements similar to those
used in twenty-first century toasters were known in the 1890s, but a functioning electric toaster
did not come about until approximately 1910. This toaster was essentially a heavy wire rack on
which two slices of bread were positioned near a central mica-insulating heating element."<br>

White bread is not a new product invented by big food companies to "dumb down" the American diet.
<p>
In all times and places, people place a high value on the finest available food products. From ancient
times forward, the finest ground wheat grain produced the whitest result. The finer the grind, the more expensive the 
product. 
Poorer people ate
rougher grades of flour [whole wheat is an example] because it was less expensive. <a href="foodbreads.html#flour">Flour</a> was
made from many grains: wheat, <a href="foodfaq.html#buckwheat">buckwheat</a>, <a href="foodbreads.html#rye">rye</a>, barley, rice, <a href="foodfaq1.html#millet">millet</a> (ancient China), corn,

historians tell us Durum wheat (semolina is one) has been grown for centuries in Italy expressly
for the purpose of making pasta. The use of whole wheat to make pasta seems to be a relatively
modern idea.
<p>
White bread was consumed by the <a href="foodbreads.html#romanwhitebread">Ancient Romans</a>.
Medieval England distinguised between <a href="http://www.bakers.co.uk/A-Brief-History/Brown-Bakers.aspx">brown bread</a> vs.
<a href="http://www.bakers.co.uk/A-Brief-History/White-Bakers.aspx">white bread</a> bakers.
White bread became readily available and affordable to
average consumers during the industrial revolution. In addition to fine grinding, "whiteness" can be achieved naturally 
(oxidation) or chemically (alum, agene). "Whiteness" can also relate to the specific batch of flour, as determined by <a href="foodbreads.html#pekar">
Pekar's test</a>.
<p>
Chemical bleaching flour is a 20th century practice, as is the
infusion of vitamins for enrichment purposes. Challenging the nutritional value of finely ground
"white" wheat flour is nothing new. People like <a href="http://www.ivu.org/history/usa19/graham.html">Sylvester Graham</a> in the 1820s believed the fiber

"There has always been a certain snobbery about the colour of bread. For centuries the eating of white bread was considered a 
mark of social position...The Romans were probably responsible for this. The senators, the senior officers of the army and others 
took pride in providing their guests with white bread made from wheaten flour. Dark bread made from millet, barley, and other 
coarse grains was generally regarded as the food of the working classes. In Britain this question of colour hardly crops up 
until the Middle Ages...During the fourteenth century, even the peasant classes began to develop a taste for wheaten flour and there was a growing 
demand for better, which meant whiter, bread...But this demand was not to be met fully for a long time to come; in the main the 
poorer people had to be content with rye bread or maslin, made from a mixture of rye and wheat flours...Even the white bread which 
found its way on to the tables of the wealthy was by no means as white as what is baked today. Up to the middle of the last 
century, milling methods were crude by modern standards and the bran and dark parts of the wheat berry were never completely 
separated from the flour. Until the coming of the roller mill the whitest flour was virtually a wholemeal flour from which only the 
coarsest particles of bran had been removed by bolting through fine woollen or linen cloths. Most of the germ was retained and the 
yellow pigment in this had its effect on flour colour...In Early English and Tudor times the best quality white bread was known as 
paindemaigne or painmain...By the fifteenth century this bread was generally known as manchet...Throughout the Middle Ages, bakers, in London 
at least, were divided through their guilds into two distinct branches--brown and white bakers...The aim of the authorities 
in enforcing this division of bakers was to safeguard the diet of the poor by ensuring that the brown bread they ate contained the whole 
wheat germ...It was this insistence on white bread [18th century] which led to the practice of adulterating flour with alum, a practice which 
at one time seriously threatened the health of the population...Continually pestered for white bread [the bakers] sought ways of 
giving an artificial whiteness and fineness to flour of inferior quality...Although the public did not have strong feelings about 
the use of alum in bread, the medical profession in the first half of the nineteenth century was greatly concerned about the 
harmful effects of this substance...About the middle of the century the introduction of silk gauze for bolting enabled millers 
to obtain a better separation of the finer particles of bran and thus produce whiter flour by natural means. It was, however, 
the development of the roller mill which made possible the production of white flour of uniform colour and fineness...But owing 
to a rapidly increasing population neither millers nor bakers were able to store flour long enough for it to whiten naturally 
through the oxidation of the pigment on exposure to air. Fresh attempts were made to bleach flour by artificial means. Various 
processes were patented and these included exposing flour to the fumes of burning sulphur or resin or to the currents of air or ozone. The 
first really successful method involved the treatment of flour with nitrogen peroxide. In the 1920s another substance, nitrogen 
trochloride, commonly known as agene, came into wide use both in this county [UK] and the United States. Agene, about which there 
has been such controversy in recent years, was more than a bleaching agent; its most important function was as a bread improver which 
speeded up the ageing or maturing which occurs naturally only when flour can be stored for a considerable period. The use of agene 
by millers was dictated by the fact that with a large population, bakers are compelled to use their flour fairly soon after delivery. 
The controversy over the use of agene was sparked off in 1946 when Sir Edward Mellanby demonstrated that when, over a period, dogs were 
fed on a diet consisting mainly of bread with fairly high concentrations of agene they developed canine hysteria...Some doctors later 
claimed that agenised flour was responsible for nervous disorders, stomach ulcers, coronary thrombosis and decreased fertility. 
None of these claims were ever established...But there was enough doubt about the effects of agene for the United States to abandon 
its use as a bread improver. By the end of 1955, at the request of the Government its use was discontinued in Britain. In its 
place treatment by chlorine dioxide was introduced...Back in the Middle Ages doctors suspected that flour made form the whole wheat 
berry had more food value than white flour from which much of the berry had been sifted away; and this belief has returned in 
the twentieth century, with a scientific understanding of food values." <br>

<b>White bread in the USA</b><br>
"The production of wheat flour picked up after the invention in 1834 of the Swiss steel roller that ground the meal very 
finely, a process vastly improved in 1865 by French-American Edmund LeCroix, by separating bran from granual middlings with a
middling purifier and fan-driven air currents to clean the wheat as it moved through the mill. The first all-roller flour mill
was displayed in the United States at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. After 1900 American wheat flour was processed to appear white by bleaching and removal of
the wheat germ and other flecks of grain, thereby lessening its nutritive value. Today there has been a trend favoring 
unbleached and whole-wheat flours."<br>

<b>Natural oxidation vs. chemical bleaching</b><br>
"Natural oxidation" or "Natural aging" of flour may take several weeks or months, depending upon the
wheat and the storage facility. If the flour sits too long it may be susceptible to mold or rodent infestation.

date to the early 1900s. Several bleaching chemicals were employed.
<p>
"Freshly ground wheat contains small amounts of carotene, a plant pigment that gives it a yellowish tinge. Over time, the pigment
oxidizes and the flour turns off white. But in milling, time is money, and millers begain to use an improved bleaching
process using chlorine. J.N. Alsop, the founder of the Alsop Process Company, St. Louis, patented the clorine bleaching process
for flour in 1904."<br>
---<i>Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America</i>, Andrew F. Smith editor [Oxford University Press:New York] 2004, Volume 1 (p. 119)
<p>
"Chlorine bleaching of processed flour is also expedient, for the giant milling combines own the plants which manufacture the
white wrapped loaf, and artifical bleaching produces flour better suited to high-speed mechanical dough mixing than natural
unbleached flour. Bleaching is by no means a necessity, and in some countries--France is one of them--is prohibited. It is not
carried out solely in order to obtain whiter-than-white flour. it is also a method of instant maturing or ageing of the flour,
and matured flour, as long as it has been deprived of its germ, has long been recognized as giving the most satisfactory
performance for machine-made dough. To a certain extent flour whitens during storage. Not sufficently, however, to suit English millers
and bread and biscuit manufacturers, so the flour is bleached with a chemical which speeds up the ageing process. When we remember that
one of the bleaches widely used during the immediate post 1914-1918 War period and for the succeeding thirty years was called agene
we immediately understand its function (This bleach is now banned in England. It was suspected, although not proved by the
medial profession, of causing serious nervous disorders.) At the same time as maturing and bleaching the flour, chemicals destroy
its natural vitamin B content."<br>

<b>Pekar testing to determine flour color</b><br>
We learn from these turn-of-the-century professional texts that the whitest flours were not considered the best grades.
<p>
"The color of flour is best defined by the well-known "Pekar" test. A fine, creamy yellow shade is a typical color of a high-grade
flour. Starch and weak wheats usually yield white flours. The various shades may be defined as ranging from a fine, creamy
yellow, with good bloom, to a yellowish brown, brownish grey, greyish white, to a dead white color."<br.
---<i>Treatise on Flour, Yeast Fermentation and Baking together with Recipes for Bread and Cakes</i>, Julius Emil 
Wihlfahrt, Seventh edition, revised [Fleischmann Co.:no location provided] 1905, 1915(p. 24)

<p>
"The following simple tests can be found useful in deteriming the value of a flour: Colour.--The colour should be examined dry and
wet by Pekar's test. In order that this preliminary examination may be of service it is necessary to have some means of
comparison, and in the absence of the tintometer there is no better plan than to select the best brand of good milling firm and use
that as a standard. The examination of a single flour by the naked eye conveys very little accurate information as to the exact colour, but when
two flours are placed side by side there is usually little difficulty in determining which is the better of the two. Suppose there are
three flours to be examined for colour. Proceed as follows: --Procure a smooth piece of wood about 6 in. long and 3 in. wide. With a
spatula place side by side a small portion of each flour, and finally the flour you have taken as a standard of comparison. 
These portions of flour should nearly touch one another. With the spatula smooth the flours with a firm movement from 
the middle of the board to the edge. The flour should now present the appearance of a beautifully smooth mass on the board, the 
different samples touching one anohter. Examine the flours in a good white light, and note the differences in colour, placing the 
flours in order of merit in a note-book, the lightest first, down to the darkest. It is best now to put the flours again on a clean
board in the proper order, beginning with the lightest and ending with the darkest, and to examine them again...Starch flours, poor
in gluten, are indicated by a dull white colour. The best quality flours are characterized by a bright slightly yellowish-white tinge. Lower
grades are incidated by darkness in colour.
<p>
"Pekar's Test.--By this method the colours of the flours may be examined dry after having been wetted, and, therefore, some
idea may be obtained of the colour of the dough. In making the test, smooth the flours as in a second dry test (that is, in order of 
colour) and then carefully immerse in water by allowing the board to enter the water at the edge, and then describing an arc under
water. In immersing it is important to keep the board perfectly level. The flours are allowed to dry in a dark place, and
then examined. Another method is to make up small pieces of doug of standard consistency, and to place each mass on a clean
glass slide and then to press another glass on top, flattening out the dough into a sheet between the two glass plates. The
colour may be then compared. In comparing doughs it is necessary to proceed as above with glass plates, as surface dough, under the action of the air, 
darkens considerably. The value of the colour test depends on comparison, and it is very necessary for the operator to have a great
experience of various flours, or a definate standard to which he can refer all flours he examines. Lovibond's tintomenter
 gives a method of absolute comparison, but the limits of this work will not allow a detailed description."<br>

<b>What is flour?</b><br>
Flour is generally ground grain. The roots of this product are prehistoric and cross all cultures except
peoples living inhabiting Arctic regions. The grains differed according to region: wheat, rye,
oats, barley, buckwheat, millet, rice, corn. Flour can also be made from some starchy roots (potatoes), nuts (acorns)
and legumes (peas). Throughout time, wheat has been the grain of choice.  
<p>
<b>About flour milling</b><p>
"To make wheat flour the wheat must be ground by one means or another. The evolution of
grinding and milling began with the earliest known pestle and mortar, dating from about 10,000BC;
this came from the Azilian culture of S. France, where it was used to grind pigments. No doubt
pestles and mortar were subsequently used for grains, but the result they produce, although
adequate for a gruel or pottage, does not really produce flour for bread. In most places where a
series of early food-gathering implements has been found, development can be seen to have
proceeded in one of two ways. One was the larger mortar worked by two or more people
pounding alternately with long-handled pestles, as is still seen in Africa. This is quicker, but does
not give a finer grind. The other is a device in which the top stone, or pestle, rubs against the
lower stone, or mortar, with a shearing effect on the grain which can produce flour as we know
it...Such devices, sometimes called saddle stones, are represented in ancient Egyptian paintings
and tomb models and on Assyrian reliefs. Actual examples are found both in the old world and
America, where they were used for maize. Early equipment of this type has also been excavated
in the Balkans...Later progress in milling with stones depended on harnessing extra power. Once
achieved, the stones could be enlarged and flattened, but the principals remained identical. Water
power was perhaps first mentioned by Strabo in 150 BC...It spread throughout W. Europe,
bringing the potential of fine flour to most communities. Wind power was harnessed around the
year AD 1000, allowing mills to multiply still further...The conventional stone mill, even when
powered by steam engines and placed in series or groups in early industrial units created for the
supply of large towns, for example in Paris, had a relatively low output...The problem was
resolved by the efficient, fast roller mill, first tried in Hungary in the 1820s, perfected in
Switzerland in 1834, then quickly adopted all over Europe and America...For the first time, truly
white flour was available at a low price."<br>

Food historians confirm whole wheat (aka Graham's flour, etc.) bread has been popular in health food circles from the early 19th century forwards. When were 
commercially manufactured whole wheat loaves available in American grocery stores? Our survey of historic newspapers suggests they were readily available in the 
early 20th century. This period makes sense: it converged health food advocates, home economists/social nutritionists, and pure food legal advocates. Food
 shortages caused by diverting commodities to feed WWI soldiers provided the economic push Americans needed to try this alternative product.

about getting the real thing if you buy Ward's Wheatheart Bread, the real whole wheat loaf, made from genuine whole wheat flour, ground especially for us by the 
old fashioned stone process. Ward's Wheat-Heart Bread is made by the Ward standard of quality, purity and cleanliness. It is the kind you can depend on. All 
grocers will supply you on order, made in 10 cent loaves. Made in the Ward Bakeries at New York, Brooklyn and Newark."<br>

WWI-era food [wheat] shortages prompt economists to promote whole wheat bread to the American public. This tidbit also explains the prevailing preference for 
white bread. <br>
"Whole-Wheat Bread. To increase our wheat acreage is not the only way to meet the present shortage in breadstuffs. This of course must be the first object in any 
campaign to augment food supplies. However, in the grinding of the wheat and the treatment of the flour another big gain can be effected between the harvested 
grain and the finished loaf. It means something when we hear that 18,000,000 barrels of flour could have been added to last season's supply had whole wheat
 instead of white flour been the rule adopted by our millers. We cannot disregard taste and habit and prejudice, and the American people have somehow grown to 
connect the white flour loaf with our better brand of prosperity. Black bread in the past was for the serf, the slave and the downtrodden. White bread has the 
glorious heritage of the free man. But whole wheat bread is not black bread nor does it distantly resemble it in taste, color or substance. It is white bread raised to a
 higher degree of healthfulness and nutriment: it contains some food elements lost in milling white flour. The use of a whole wheat bread will conserve our food 
supplies to an appreciable extent. These are points the public should weigh well when the use of whole wheat bread is surged upon them by economists."<br>

The practice of cutting bread (or not) at the dinner tabple depends period, place and culture. The role of knives and 
other sharp, pointy objects at the dinner table are viewed
differently by different peoples. The rules also vary depending upon the size and shape of loaf and
dining context. In the United States during the 1860s, finely set dinner tables did not sport bread
knives. Civil War soldiers living in the fields, on the other hand, likely hacked chunks of stale
bread with pocket knives. 
<p>
"...the French...are shocked by knives being used on bread at table. The change to breaking rather
than cutting bread, among the eighteenth-century French aristocracy, seems to have been part of
the move towards an elegant simplicity in manners as the new hallmark of good taste. French
bread is not usually sliced for buttering or for toasting; Anglo-Saxon methods of eating bread
often require knives for spreading as well as cutting, and also the provision of butter plates. Pain
de campagne, the parge, solid, round country loaf of France, is correctly cut in pieces; a man may
whip out his pocket knife, grip the loaf under his arm, and carve out a slice. He must cut from the
outer edge and towards his own body, so that no one else is endangered by his exploit.
"Viennese" baguettes, on the other hand, are soft white table bread; they are sliced, but away
from the table, and served in a bread basket. The refusal to cut them at table is a statement about
the kind of bread it is, and the distinction that is being made between it an pain de campagne." <br>

"Where people eat with their hands from a common dish, it is etiquette that nothing bitten should be put back...Such rules are made
largely irrelevant by the modern custom of serving everybody separate protions, but we keep to the spirit of them by disliking teeth-marks
left, for example, in bread. Bread is to broken in pieces small enough to be consumed entire and not put back on the side plate:
teeth-marks remind of of teeth, and anything bitten is 'left-overs.'"<br>

<b>Bread etiquette II: bread or butter knives?</b><br>
The <i>American Silver and Flatware 1837-1910</i>/Noel D. Turner contains hundreds of pages

Butter knives
(for buttering bread) and crumb knives (for scraping bread crumbs off the table) are included. Even today, in
American/European cultures, bread is generally <a href="foodbreads.html#cutortear">broken</a> with the hands. Not cut with a knife.
That's why you don't find bread knives in fine restaurants. Family restaurants serving hot loaves

"Those in the know are aware that top-quality bread should be served at room temperature, but some guests want hot bread. However, reheated
bread goes stale faster, and if it's unused, it usually had to be thrown out at the end of the night. The answer is to serve at
bread room temperature and warm it up for those who request it. If you put the bread basket on the table as soon as the guests sit down,
they may fill up on your wonderful bread but not order as much from the menu. So you might want to change your sequence of service and
serve bread after the order has been taken. In more luxurious restaurants, though, you aren't as worried about people ordering enough
food, so you can still serve the bread before the order is taken."<br>

America [John Wiley & Sons.:New York] 2005 (p. 182)
<p>
"In some establishments, the house standard of serve may specify that bread is to be served after the order has been taken--so the
guest will not 'fill up' on the bread. As the bread and butter plate is to the left of the cover, bread is served from the left. Note the
 use of the 
fork and spoon for serving the roll...You may hear this style of service referred to as 'pince,' the French word for 'pinch.' 
To execute this maneuver, rest the spoon on your pinky, ring, and middle fingers and use your pinky finger to grip the handle. Place th fork
between the index finger and the thumb. The tines of the fork should be up for sliced bread and down to better grasp rolls.
 Sometimes a basket of bread and a dish of butter are placed on the table. For takes with six or more guests, two baskets and
two butter plates are more convenient."<br>

The answer is: they don't. Savvy restauranteurs set menu prices to cover this cost. Menu prices also cover ingredients, equipment, salaries, utilities, insurance, laundry and 
supplies. Bread has been served in American public eateries from colonial times forward. Traditionally, there is no extra charge for the
 "staff of life." Bread is cheap and engages the hungry diner while he waits for his meal.

the Hotel Men's Association agreed to an innovation in restaurant management. Perhaps he will be warned before eating but it may be 
that the blow will fall when the check is presented. In the latter case we will see thrust before him an extra charge of 
10 cents for bread and butter which formerly came gratis. The high cost of foodstuffs is to blame, not themselves, say the hotel keepers, who, 
according to their own statements, have barely been able to cover restaurant expenses under the old system. After a deal of telephoning 
early last night a group of the Broadway hotel proprietors came to the conclusion that enough were in agreement for them to make the 
Oct. 1 innovation agreed upon. From Broadway the infection spread up Fifth Avenue to the Hotel Plaza and the St. Regis, skipping here 
and there hotels which have a family patronage. Many other hotels like the Astor, the Waldorf, and the Park Avenue could not decide 
the question until this morning, when their trade should come. The Knickerbocker and the Belmont, not being members of the Hotel 
Men's Association refused to consider the change. Those which were agreed last night to put an extra charge on this morning's bills 
were the Imperial, Martinique, Ritz-Carlton, St. Regis and Plaza." <br>

"New Yorkers with long memories who recall the historic day when restaurants began charging 10 cents for bread and butter will be interested to 
learn that the scheme for abolishing free bread with meals throughout the German Empire, as well as putting 70,000,000 people on a 
bread ration, was launched with rather less excitement and far less friction...Patriotic Americans who began celebrating Washington's Birthday 
the night before and returned to their hotel rooms in the early morning hours had, some of them, the shock of their lives when they saw flaming red 
placards pasted on the walls above their beds. It look as if the place had been put under quarantine; but the poster contained the following even 
more exciting announcement: The Bread Cards instituted by the authorities are to be found for each of our honored guests and good for ONE DAY 
ONLY at the Bread Card Desk in the lobby to be obtained daily. The honored guests are reminded that from Feb. 22 bread may only be given at 
meals on presentation of this official bread card. We therefore beg guests always to keep the BREAD CARD by them and to give it back 
on paying the bill on the day of departure. THE MANAGEMENT. You could buy and eat all the cake you wanted to, but not even an American millionaire 
could get a crust of bread in Berlin without producing his bread card. It was Red Monday, not only were the red posters conspicuously 
put up in hotel rooms, but all the advertisement pillars of Berlin were plastered with red announcements explaining the intricacies of the new bread 
ordinance." <br>

<b>[1997: artisinal bread revolution] </b><br>
"Using his plastic tongs as a pointer, a waiter at Aquavit quickly indicates the key sectors of his teeming wicker breadbasket. There 
are slices of sourdough bread, seven-grain bread and semolina with golden raisins and fennel. Off to the either side lurk a dried-blueberry-and- 
walnut roll and a stern looking flat Swedish rye bread. The basket sags under the weight. The tongs hover expectantly. The 
pressure builds. For the unprepared diner, it's like a lecture followed by a pop quiz...In a more innocent time, bread was a simple 
affair at most restaurants. The diner was presented with a roll, perhaps, or a few chaste slices of sourdough bread. No more. 
The artisinal bread movement that has gathered force in the last decade seems to have entered a baroque phase. The once-humble 
breadbasket has become a painstakingly composed still life that arrests the eye with beguiling shapes and textures, a flavor festival that 
clamors for attention with waves of spices, herbs and fruits--sometimes all in the same roll. It is symptomatic of the present movement that 
Marcus Samuelsson, the chef at Aquavit, started out with a three-grain bread, upped the ante to five and pushed onward to seven. And 
it was perhaps inevitable that Daniel Bouley, whose Bouley bakery in TriBeCa is the latest in a wave of restaurant-bakery partnerships, should 
devise a bread trolley with 22 different offerings. Bakers, chefs and food historians have a few theories for the bread explosion in general...Most agree that bread, for 
reasons no one fully understands, simply sat there, ignored, while a culinary revolution swept over the land. 'Bread has been 
a disgrace on the American plate for ages,' Said Barbara Haber, a food historian at the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe College... 
...Diners are reeling. Two seconds after unfolding their napkins, they get an invitation to carbo load. A few short years ago, many 
restaurants could not manage to serve bread with a crust worthy of the name. Now, the bread selection is beginning to rival the wine 
list. 'Restaurants and chefs have very sophisticated marketing ideas about their bread baskets...They look for special colors and 
textures and shapes. And everyone wants something custom.'....There is probably an upper limit to creativity, imposed by money. 
Bread is one of the two things that restaurants give away, the other being water, which, unlike bread, costs virtually 
nothing. As the chefs pile nut upon nut, grain upon grain, and the expense spirals upward, more and more restaurants are not only 
thinking the unthinkable but talking about it: charging for bread." <br>

<b>[2011: restaurant economics II: free vs. fee revisited] </b><br>
"After learning the hard way about how rowdy inebriated customers can get waiting for something to come out of the kitchen on a busy night, I can attest to the 
calming influence of hot bread and herb butter! Something tasty to nibble on can also mellow the temperament of guests who have had to wait for a table, been 
subject to a reservation mix-up, or are just plain cranky due to no fault of the restaurant. I've heard veteran guests tell their friends, "you're going to love the bread 
here." That, too, is worth the extra pennies and time to serve it...Bread is something that is very very cheap to make, and customers really enjoy it. I know that it's up to the discretion of each restaurant but I am of the strong opinion that in today's economic climate it's good to keep offering your customers what they expect and that it's not that expensive to offer a great product at a reasonable price. 
..."We're located in the Midwest's heartland and my decision to not offer complimentary bread, for some, is considered a travesty. While I grew up in the Midwest and love a bread basket as much as anyone, I couldn't stand future thoughts of wasted product, theft and the expectation of providing something free simply because "everyone else is doing it.' I understand the theories behind "free bread.' I just didn't want to bow to peer pressure. I also wanted this restaurant to be different. Our current menu includes an oven-warmed baguette with garlic and herb-whipped butter and it is a very popular menu item. Very infrequently, we have a new guest that is looking for that complimentary bread basket and my staff knows to use very gentle words in directing them to the bread offering on the regular menu. Almost always, the guest will order the bread and that's that. 
..."Serving bread after the order is taken has its merits by not filling a customer up on bread. The practice of serving a customer alcohol on an empty stomach, however, raises serious concerns that may outweigh the loss of an appetizer sale. I also have found that if the staff is trained to politely ask if the customer desires bread before automatically serving it will minimize cost. 
..."Last year our total cost of high-quality dinner rolls was more than $75,000, which is not chump change for an independent operation like ours. We surveyed our Facebook fans and our e-mail list. The answer? They would like something to nosh on - not necessarily dinner rolls. We eliminated the free rolls and now give out a basket of oyster crackers, bread sticks and flat bread with an anise honey butter. For an additional $2.75 ($1.25 over cost), customers can order a 16-ounce semolina boule onion loaf with honey butter. 
..."We are well-known for our honey wheat bran rolls. We have never charged for them and refill orders for additional requests as well. I have considered charging for additional rolls at lunchtime only. The last few years have been extremely tough on my restaurant, and although charging for additional rolls is not a make or break policy, every little bit of savings helps. But I am afraid that the negative feedback would outweigh the savings. So, I haven't pulled the trigger. 
..."We used to automatically send out one roll per entree and, in turn, threw away at least 80 percent of them. Now the servers ask after the salads if guests would like bread with their meal. We have saved a ton in wasted dough (pun intended). 
..."We changed our menu about five years ago and discontinued the practice of the free breadbasket. We chose to move our signature bread offering of biscuits, zucchini bread and corn muffins served on a grilled flour tortilla plate to our appetizer page for $6.50 each. Incidentally, we sold 941 of them last year alone. It was not without great debate and apprehension that we finally chose this approach. I agree with you on the point that people tend to skip an appetizer for the table if the bread is brought out first. I battle with my staff on this point regularly. 
..."The price of every item across the board is soaring in this industry from goods to utilities to fuel. We have not raised our prices in five years, but we have cut back costs wherever possible. Our business is stable and I am happy to report has survived these economically challenging years. We are a family owned and operated business of over 20 years. We did not get this far serving free bread. Our personal connection to our customers and our approach - make them feel special and want to chose us over our competitors - are what keep them coming back week after week.

<b>About bakery mechanization</b><br>
"The mechanization of bakery production did not end at the baking stage. It embraced the cooling, slicing, and wrapping of bread, all of which were extremely 
important to a successful bakery operation. Wrapped bread was essential for two reasons. First, its use as an advertising medium could not be overlooked.
 Second, consumer concern about sanitation demanded it. But until 1911, bread was either wrapped by hand with paper and string or merely put into paper sacks. 
At that time, the first wrapping machine in the industry appeared. Unlike the modern machines, it merely applied a wax seal to the ends of a paper wrapper, 
eliminating the need for string. But within three years, the forerunner of the modern wrapping machine was put into operation. Using fully waxed paper,
 it automatically folded the paper around the loaf and sealed the wrapper by means of a heating plate. These early machines were crude affairs, hard to operate, 
and subject to frequent breakdown, but they were far more satisfactory and economical than hand wrapping. By 1930, with improved engineering and design,
 specifically better heat controls and variable speed, automatic wrapping was in full used except in the retail bakeshops"<br>

"Slicing machines were a later development. The first slicer was invented in 1917, but it was destroyed, plans and all, in a fire before it was generally made
 available. It was not until 1928 that another machine was invented which did an efficient job. The mechanized problem of the slicing machine was a difficult one, for
 the sliced had to be held together until they moved into the automatic wrapper. many devices were tried including rubber bands, string, and wire pins. These were
 finally abandoned in favor of a collapsible cardboard bread tray, patented earlier by a St. Louis baker, G.C. Papendick. With Papendick's device, the loaf was
 fitted into a tray and held firmly while being sliced, and the entire unit, slices and tray, was then wrapped. Even then, many bakers hesitated to add such equipment
 to their plant until they were sure the housewife was willing to pay the cost of having her bread sliced."

<a name="heel">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Heel of the loaf</b></font><br>

According to <i>The Oxford English Dictionary</i> (accessed online June 3, 2014) the word "heel," as it applies to bread, has been used from Medieval times forward. 
Curiously? The definition is different from what we Americans think of today:<blockquote>
 
"8. The crust at the bottom (also, sometimes, the top) of a loaf; the rind of a cheese.
 
1362   Langland Piers Plowman A. viii. 181,   I nolde ?eue for i pardoun one pye hele.
 
1611   R. Cotgrave Dict. French & Eng. Tongues,   Esquignonner, to cut, or breake off a lumpe, cantle, crustie heele, or peece from a loafe of bread.
 
a1774   R. Fergusson Poems (1785) 151,   I wat weel They'll stoo the kebbuck to the heel.
 
1814   Scott Waverley III. xvi. 240   The heel o' the white loaf that came from the bailie's.
 
1849   Dickens David Copperfield (1850) xi. 117   The heel of a Dutch cheese.
 
1879   G. F. Jackson Shropshire Word-bk.,   Heel, the top crust of a loaf cut off, or the bottom crust remaining."
 </blockquote>
 <b>Why call it "heel?"</b><br>
Food historians are silent on this topic. Common wisdom assumes it is because the placement of the "heel" on a loaf of sandwich bread corresponds somewhat to the human foot. 
<i>The Oxford English Dictionary</i> also offers a definition of "heel" as something resembling the physical heel of a human foot. American definitions reflect that 
lineage, using bread as an example: <blockquote>
Something resembling the back part of the human food in position, shape, etc. a heel of bread<br>
 
---<i>Random House Unabridged Dictionary</i>, 2nd edition, Newly Revised and Updated [Random House:New York] 1987 (p. 886)
</blockquote>

In the case of modern standard commercial sandwich loaves, we wonder which end would be considered the heel? The 1943 quote below suggests it's the one closest 
to the package opening. Of course, the "heel" at the other end would be an identical twin. Thrifty American cooks repurposed the heels instead of throwing them out.
Julia Child suggested using the heel to cover the stuffed cavity when roasting a turkey (insulator to lock in moisture). Genius!

and fill with remaining stuffing...Remove from the bowl, and place a heel of bread or a piece of foil over the exposed cavity."<br>

Food historians tell us bread has been used to hold other foods for thousands of years. Pizza,
wraps, and bruchetta were all enjoyed by ancient people. Bread bowls (as in, holding soup or
other thick liquid foods) were well documented as far back as Medieval Europe. They were
called "trenchers" back then. These crusty, edible, hollowed out pieces of bread were used to
serve soup on the finest Kingly tables and poorest peasant groaning boards. They were
econmical (good way to use up stale bread) &  efficient (did an excellent job holding the food).
Today, we eat the <a href="foodbreads.html#breadbowls">bread bowl</a>. 500 years ago you didn't.

"If we are to believe fifteenth-century books of etiquette and manuals of instruction addressed to
young men in the household service of personages of rank, the manner of cutting and presenting
table bread was as important as the composition of the bread itself. John Russell, who had been
Usher and Marshal to Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, younger brother of Henry V, wrote or
compiled a <i>Boke of Nurture</i> in which he describes how a servitor, having first cut square
trenchers from large, four-day-old coarse loaves--wooden and pewter trenchers were still
uncommon--was then to prepare the table bread:  'furst pare the quarters of the looff round all
about, then kutt the upper crust for your sovarayne', i.e. lord."<br>

Hess [Penguin Books:New York] 1980 (p. 331-2)

"The [Medieval] table setting for each diner normally consisted of a napkin, a spoon, and a trencher. The latter was a thick slice of
four-day-old bread that served as an edible or otherwise disposable plate. Soaked with gravy it could be eaten by a hungry diner,
but more often it was given to the dog, donated to the poor as alms. In the early modern period bread trenchers were gradually
replaced by wooden or metal ones. According to the Menagier de Paris (Householder of Paris), the trencher, derived from the 
French verb for cutting, trancher, was to be "half a foot wide and four inches height." Ordinary diners sometimes cut their
own trenchers, but those of high station were always served their trenchers by the carver, who cut them in the desired square
shape seen in many medieval illustrations. The function of the trencher was temporarily to hold the food taken from the
shared bowl and to soak up the juice that would otherwise have soiled the tablecloth."<br>

"Laying the table could thus be done after the guests were seated if they were a great many of them. Sometimes a cup and a loaf
were given to each person. John Russell (in the early fifteenth century) noted that the lord had new bread (the upper crust was
particularly reserved for the lord) and the others had one-day-old bread. The household staff had three-day-old bread and the
trenchers were made from that which was four days old. Trenchers of bread were superceded by those of wood or metal in the 
course of the sixteenth century...It was important that bread was cut squarely and tidily. The loaf was round when 
made, but a square shape was regarded as much more elegant. The Goodman of Paris wrote that trench bread should be of 
brown bread 6 inches wide and 4 inches high, but it is not clear if this was before or after cutting. The carver was in charge of
cutting the trenchers for the lord. With his knife he cut off pieces from the bread, as well as the trencher for another
member of the staff, to 'assay', that is to test for poison. He touched another piece of bread on it for assay as well...After this
the carver cut four trenchers and laid them before his lord in a quadrant on top of which he laid three small pieces of bread. He
was enjoined to use his broad knife to move the bread and to hold it on a napkin, thus avoiding any touch. These trenchers
were cut carefully and presented to the lord on the point of the knife."<br>

"The meal would usually start with the Tudor mainstay, pottage. This would be eaten from a communal bowl...a trencher was a
special dish rather like a modern plate. During the Middle Ages these had been made of four-day-old bread and for much of the
sixteenth century bread trenchers were still used...You would take meat from the communal dish, dip it into one of the sauces 
provided...and then put the piece of meat into your mouth. The trencher could be used as a halfway stage between the two, although
it was very bad mannered to pile it high with food..."<br>

<b>Bread bowls</b><br>
Modern bread bowls, used for soup or dips, are a rediscovery of <a href"#trenchers">Medieval trenchers</a>.
American cookbooks confirm hollowed out bread loaves, filled with dips, were popular party fare in the mid-20th century. Our survey of 
magazine & newspaper articles reveals modern bread bowls (for holding soup, chowder & chili) became popular in the
United States in the late 1980s. Unlike their Medieval counterparts, today's fresh bread bowls are meant to be consumed.
