                                           FOOD TIMELINE LIBRARY
1. The following books are in our private collection. We use them (along with newspaper databases, historic magazines, 
library resources & local experts) to answer your food history questions. 
2. Our books are not for sale or lending via Interlibrary Loan. 
3. List prices are what we actually paid. They do not necessarily reflect the current "value" of the book.
4. We also own an extensive historic collection of recipe booklets published by American food companies, old magazines, and 
Betty Crocker ephemera. Catalog here: http://www.foodtimeline.org/cookingbrochures.xls 
5. How is our library organized? By general topic, then chronological or alphabetical order. Definately not Dewey. 
Topics: general reference, USA food history, USA cookbooks, state foods, presidental cookbooks, companies & brand cookbooks, children's cookbooks,
alcoholic beverages, food "biographies," restaurants & foodservice, social customs & etiquette, food & the arts (literature,
fine arts), International foods (by country, the period), children's cookbooks, and holidays. 
6. How are our books selected? Historic merit, scholarly documentation, author reputation, customer demand, "classic" 
items, unusual/interesting culinary contributions. Several editions of standard cook books (Better Homes & Gardens Cook Book, 
The Settlement Cook Book, etc.) trace subtle changes in American taste.
7. Where do we get our books? The Old Book Shop (Morristown, NJ), used book stores, antiquarian dealers, museums, online booksellers 
(Amazon, Alibris, AbeBooks, UsedBookCentral) & donations.
8. DISCONTINUED: If you are interested in information/recipes from any of our items let us know: foodtimeline@aol.com
9. Why is this list so ugly? It's an inventory created for insurance/estate purposes. 
10. How many books are in the Food Timeline library? 2,363.
