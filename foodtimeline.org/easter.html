<b>Easter food symbolism</b><br>
Much written about the symbolism/traditions of Easter foods. These foods work on three
levels:<br> (1) Those items specifically related to Christ (lamb, the "Lamb of God")<br>
(2) Those items traceable to pagan rites of spring (eggs=rebirth, ham=luck, lamb=sacrifice,
cake/bread=fertility)<br>
(3) Modern interpretations & evolutions (candy and toys in fancy baskets)
<p>
"Easter foods are primarily those of Easter Sunday, the day on which Jesus rose from the dead, a
day of special rejoicing for Christians, who rejoice too at reaching the end of the long Lenten fast.
The concept of renewal/rebirth is responsible for the important role played by the egg in Easter
celebrations, a role which no doubt antedates Christianity. There are also special foods associated
with the other days in the Easter calendar...In Europe, there is a general tradition, not confined to
Christians, that Easter is the time to start eating the season's new lamb, which is just coming onto 
the market then...Easter breads, cakes, and biscuits are a major category of Easter foods, perhaps
especially noticeable in the predominantly Roman Catholic countries of south and central
Europe...Traditional breads are laden with symbolism in their shapes, which may make reference
to Christian faith...In England breads or cakes flavoured with bitter tansy juice used to be popular
Easter foods...Simnel cake has come to be regarded as an Easter specialty, although it was not
always so. The most popular English Easter bread is the hot cross bun..."<br>

Easter foods. If you need more information please ask your librarian to help you find these.]

<a name="easterbunny">
<b>Where did the Easter bunny come from? </b><br>
"Among the most familiar Easter symbols [is] the rabbit. The Easter bunny or rabbit is...most likely of pre-Christain origin. The rabbit was known as an extraodinarily fertile creature, and hence it symbolized the coming of spring. Although adopted in a number of Christian cultures, the Easter bunny has never received any specific Christian interpretation."
<br>---"Easter," <i>Encyclopedia of Religion</i>, 2nd edition, Lindsay Jones, editor in chief [Thomson Gale:Detroit] 1987, volume 4 (p. 2580)
<p> 
This delightful custom, like the Christmas tree, was introduced to America by people of German descent. <br>
"The Pennsylvania Dutch imported the Oschter Haws, or Easter Hare, who delivered colored eggs to good children...By the early nineteenth century, entire Pennsylvania Dutch villages would turn out with gaily decorated Easter eggs to play games, including egg-eating contests."

<b>EASTER EGGS</b><br>
Eggs are traditionally connected with <a href="foodeggs.html#eggsymbolism">rebirth, rejuvenation and immortality</a>. This is why they are
often associated with Easter. On a more practical level? In the early Christian calendar eggs were
forbidden during Lent. This made them bountiful and exciting forty days later. Easter eggs are
sometimes decorated with bright colors to honor this celebration. <a href="easter.html#decorate">Russian Faberge and Ukranian Pysanky<a> are two of the
most elaborate forms. Conversely, the abstinence of eggs is associated with Lent. 
<p>
"Eggs were colored, blessed, exchanged and eaten as part of the rites of spring long before
Christian
times. Even the earliest civilizations held springtime festivals to welcome the sun's rising from its
long
winter sleep. They thought of the sun's return from darkness as an annual miracle and regarded
the
egg as a natural wonder and a proof of the renewal of life. As Christianity spread, the egg was
adopted as a symbol of Christ's Resurrection from the tomb.
For centuries, eggs were among the foods forbidden by the church during Lent, so it was a special
treat to have them again at Easter. In Slavic countries, baskets of food including eggs are
traditionally
taken to church to be blessed on Holy Saturday or before the Easter midnight Mass, then taken
home
for a part of Easter breakfast.
People in central European countries have a long tradition of elaborately decorated Easter eggs.
Polish, Slavic and Ukrainian people create amazingly intricate designs on the eggs. They draw
lines
with a wax pencil or stylus, dip the egg in color and repeat the process many times to make true
works of art. Every dot and line in the pattern has a meaning. Yugoslavian Easter eggs bear the
initials "XV" for "Christ is Risen," a traditional Easter greeting.
The Russians, during the reign of the tsars, celebrated Easter much more elaborately than
Christmas,
with Easter breads and other special foods and quantities of decorated eggs given as gifts. The
Russian royal family carried the custom to great lengths, giving exquisitely detailed jeweled eggs
made by goldsmith Carl Faberge from the 1880's until 1917.
<p>
In Germany and other countries of central Europe, eggs that go into Easter foods are not broken,
but
emptied out. The empty shells are painted and decorated with bits of lace, cloth or ribbon, then
hung
with ribbons on an evergreen or small leafless tree. On the third Sunday before Easter, Moravian
village girls used to carry a tree decorated with eggshells and flowers from house to house for
good
luck. The eggshell tree is one of several Easter Traditions carried to America by German settlers
especially those who became known as Pennsylvania Dutch. They also brought the fable that the
Easter bunny delivered colored eggs for good children.
Easter is an especially happy time for children and many Easter customs are for their enjoyment.
Hunting Easter eggs hidden around the house or yard is a universal custom and so are egg-rolling
contests."<br>

"Because the use of eggs was forbidden during Lent, they were brought to the table on Easter
Day, coloured red to symbolize the Easter joy. This custom is found not only in the Latin but also
in the Oriental Churches. The symbolic meaning of a new creation of mankind by Jesus risen from
the dead was probably an invention of later times. The custom may have its origin in paganism,
for a great many pagan customs, celebrating the return of spring, gravitated to Easter. The egg is
the emblem of the germinating life of early spring. Easter eggs, the children are told, come from
Rome with the bells which on Thursday go to Rome and return Saturday morning. The sponsors
in some countries give Easter eggs to their god-children. Coloured eggs are used by children at
Easter in a sort of game which consists in testing the strength of the shells (Kraus, Real-Encyklop
die, s. v. Ei). Both coloured and uncoloured eggs are used in some parts of the United States for
this game, known as "egg-picking". Another practice is the "egg-rolling" by children on Easter
Monday on the lawn of the White House in Washington."<br>

<b>Why do we have Easter egg hunts?</b><br>
"From very early days the finding of eggs has been identified with riches. The relationship is readily apparent. Eggs are a 
treasure, a bounty of nature, and when hens are unconfined they deposit these treasures in unexpected places. To find such a hidden
nest before a hen has started to set and incubate the eggs is a perfect analogy to finding hidden treasure."<br>

<a name="decorate">
<p><b>Why do we decorate eggs?</b><br>
Historians tell us the people have been decorating eggs for thousands of years. The practice was inspired by religion. 
Techniques and styles vary according to culture and period. Decorative eggs were also fabricated from other foods, most
notably confectionery. Notes here:
<p>
"Because eggs embody the essence of life, people from ancient times to the modern day have
surrounded them wtih magical beliefs, endowing them with the power not only to create life but
to prophesy the future. Eggs symbolize birth and are believed to ensure fertility. They also
symbolize rebirth, and thus long life and even immortality. Eggs represent life in its various stages
of development, encompassing the mystery and magic of creation...The concept of eggs as life
symbols went hand in hand with the concept of eggs as emblems of immortality. Easter eggs, in
fact, symbolize immortality, and particularly the resurrection of Christ, who rose from a sealed
tomb just as a bird breaks through an eggshell."<br>
---<i>Nectar and Ambrosia: An Encyclopedia of Food in World Mythology</i>, Tamra Andrews
[ABC-CLIO:Santa Barbara CA] 2000 (p. 85-6)
<p>
"Apparently eggs were colored red to represent the life force as early as 5000 B.C. and given as emblems of friendship during the 
festivals of the spring equinox. No one knows how long ago the custom began in China of giving red eggs to children on their 
birthdays; red for the Chinese symbolizes long life and happiness. The Persians have also exchanged elaborately gilded and 
painted eggs for thousands of years. Christianity readily adopted eggs...to its own symbolic uses. The shell became the symbol
of the tomb from which Christ had risen and the meat of the egg the representation of resurrection, of the new life of the
new Christian, and of the hope of eternal life...Thus, it might be said that most cultures have their own "egg signature"--
their own style and form of egg decoration or of fabricating eggs from other materials. While these "styles" were originally 
religious in character, they have become intricate, elaborate, often costly, and almost uniformly secular. Even within the Western
Christian tradition there are...numerous variations in egg decoration. In certain areas of Germany, Easter eggs were hung on 
trees and bushes, and the Pennsylvania Dutch (really Germans) brought this custom to America...One of the most common 
variations of the fabricated...egg is the egg that opens to reaveal a "surprise" or treasure. The most spectactular of this
genre is probably the famous Nuremberg egg made in 1700. it opens to reveal a gold yolk, which in turn yields an enamel
chick, which contains a jeweled egg, and that contains a handsome ring. The painting of Easter eggs (as opposed to dyeing) dates from 
the thirteenth century, but the art of fabricating ornate artifical eggs with "treasures" inside was a sixteenth-century invention...
Louis XV...secularized the custom by encouraging the decorating of eggs as ordinary gifts...the jeweled egg--was brought to its
greatest point of refinement by Carl Faberge..."<br>

<b>Easter candy</b><br>
The tradition of exchanging decorated candies, chocolates, <a href="foodcandy.html#jellybeans">jelly beans</a> and other 
sweets at Easter flourished in the 19th century. 
Coincidentally, this is the same time folks began exchanging the same type of specialized sweets for
<a href="valentines.html"> Valentines

<blockquote>
<b>[1820s London]<br>
"Egg Comfits:</b><br>
'Have the two halves of an egg made in box-wood; take some gum paste, roll it out, thin, and put into the casts, make it lay
close, cut off with a knife the outside edges quite smooth, let them dry...They are usually filled with imitations of all sorts
of fruits--In Paris they put in a number of nick-nacks, little almanacks, smelling bottles with essences, and even things of value, for
presents. Join the two halves with some of the same paste, moistend with a little water and gum arabic'...
These eggs were covered with syrup in the comfit pan, which, considering the fragility of sugar
paste, must have been a delicate operation. It is still perfectly feasible to make such eggs, although
no one but the most dedicated of experimental confectioners would ever attempt to pan them. The
underlying concept has survived, but removed to an entirely different branch of confectionery, to
enjoy enormous success as the chocolate Easter egg."<br>

<b>"No. 212. Eggs in Rock Sugar.</b>
Make moulds which open in two equal parts, shaped like large eggs; place them on a table, and take sugar prepared as at No. 209, and
fill one half of each mould, while your assistant closes them instantly and completely. They are very light, and look very
natural.
<p>
<b>"No. 213.--Eggs in Grained Sugar.</b><br>
To make egg-shells as thin as natural ones, take moulds in lead, opening in two, and run one side in grained sugar, as for 
bon-bons, (see No. 53); another person must instantly close it, turning it round in his hands till the sugar has taken all round the mould
inside; there must be a person to every two moulds, as only one can be turned in the hand at a time; the egg comes out whole, having neither
opening nor seam; it is empty and transparent, nor can any one imagine how it is made. Fruit, or any thing else, may be imitated in the
same manner. If you choose to break one end of the egg, it may be filled with yellow cream to represent the yolk of a boiled egg."<br>

"Hollow Chocolate Eggs.</b><br>
Take a small cocoanut, saw carefully in two lengthwise and clean out center thoroughly. Dry well, then grease the inside with Nucoa
Butter. Take sweet chocolate coating that has been thoroughly chilled and cover the inside to a thickness of about 1/2 inch. Set
in a cool place and allow to harden. When hard and cool, remove the chocolate crust carefully from the shell. Do not handle too much as they 
scratch easily. Repeat the foregoing operation for as many eggs as you wish, then take two of the halved shells, spread moist
coating along the shells and stick them together. Before sticking them together, drop two or three little pieces of candy inside the shells so
as to produce a rattle when the shells are closed. Now when the shells are stuck together run a band of any color icing around the joint. 
The entire egg can be iced if so desired, or the coating can be given a rough appearance."
<p>
<b>"Easter Bunny Wafers</b><br>
Run cream into a flat rabbit mold in starch, flavoring and coloring to suit. Allow the cream to set, then remove from the starch. Now run a hard
buterscotch wafer...on a greased slab. Run these wafers about 2 1/2 inches in diameter then have a helper put a cream rabbit flatly in the 
center of each wafer. Work quickly as the butterscotch sets rapidly. Placing a couple of very small candy eggs besides the
rabbit looks nice and increases the novelty of the piece.
<p>
<b>"Fried Eggs Made of Candy in a Frying Pan</b><br>
Get some toy skillets; cast a couple of circles of white cream in the center (cast only one if room will not permit two). After the white has hardened
cast a little bright orange cream on top of the white. You will now have a fried egg made of candy. When the egg or eggs harden, with a brush
coat them with a thin syrup, then take sugar and powdered charcoal, rubbed down, and shake this lightly over the
syrup to give a salt and pepper effect."

<a name="easterham">
<b>Why do some people serve ham for Easter dinner?</b><br>
Historians tell us religions sometimes use food (taboos/traditional holiday meals) to forge identity
and create community.
Early Christians embraced ham, in part, to proclaim their religious beliefs.
<p>
According to the <i>Encyclopedia of Religion</i>, Mircea Eliade editor in chief [MacMillan:New
York] 1987, volume
5 (p. 558):<br>
"Among Easter foods the most significant is the Easter lamb, which is in many places the main
dish of the Easter Sunday
meal. Corresponding to the Passover lamb and to Christ, the Lamb of God, this dish has become a
central symbol of
Easter. Also popular among European and Americans on Easter is ham, because the pig was
considered a symbol of
luck in pre-Christian Europe."

<a name="easterbreads">
<b>Easter Breads</b><br>
Bread has long played an important role in religious ceremonies and holidays. This is true in
many cultures and cuisines. Holiday breads are often baked in symbolic shapes and include
special ingredients. Easter breads often feature eggs, a commodity forbidden by the Catholic
Church during lent. <a href="easter.html#hotcrossbuns">English Hot Cross Buns</a>, <a href="easter.html#colomba">Italian Colomba</a> & <a href="easter.html#kulich">Russian Kulich</a> are two prime examples of this
culinary genre.
<p>
<b>Bread symbolism</b><br>
"Easter celebrates the resurrection of Christ but it also celebrates fertility, and the season of
renewal...On Holy Thursday to commemorate the Last Supper, when
Christ shared bread with his disciples, they prepare in absolute silence a brioche or egg bread
called koulitch. On the Saturday night of Resurrection, they walk in procession to church with a
basket of eggs, holding a candle in one hand, and the bread in the other. They exchange a kiss
and ask each other's forgiveness for any offense they might have committed against one another,
as a token of peace for the future."<br>
---<i>The History of Bread</i>, Bernard Dupaigne, Harry N. Abrams :New York] 1999 (p. 137, 139)
<p>
"Easter has always had a close association with food. The word comes from the name for the
Anglo-Saxon goddess of light and spring, Eostre, and special dishes were cooked in her honour
so that the year would be endowed with fertility. Most important of these dishes was a small
spiced bun, from which our hot cross bun derives but from which also the traditional spicy sweet
bread of Greece probably had its origins. The baking of buns associated with religious offerings
goes back to remotest antiquity. The Egyptians offered small round cakes to the goddess of the
moon, each marked with a representation of the horns of an ox, which were her symbol. In
ancient Greece, a similar small, sacred bread containing the finest sifted flour and honey, had the
name bous meaning "ox" and from which the word bun is said to have originated. In time, the
representation of the horns became a simple cross, although it also has been suggested that this
was intended to symbolise the four quarters of the moon. The old association of protection and
fertility, and thus birth and rebirth, was transposed into a Christianised form and the ritual of
baking "hot cross buns" became standard practice of the Easter celebration in English society. In
the Baltic region of Russia, their Easter cake is kulich, a yeast dough of enormous proportions
lavishly decorated with crystallised citrus peel. In traditional households it is presented on a table
decorated with decorated eggs and the younger members of the family visit to share the eggs
and bread."<br>

<b>Hot Cross Buns</b><p>
"The practice of eating special small cakes at the time of the Spring festival seems to date back at
least to
the ancient Greeks, but the English custom of eating spiced buns on Good Friday was perhaps
institutionalized in Tudor times, when a London bylaw was introduced forbidding the sale of such
buns
except on Good Friday, at Christmas, and at burials. The first intimation we have of a cross
appearing on
the bun, in remembrance of Christ's cross, comes in <i>Poor Robin's Amanack</i> (1733):  Good Friday
comes
this month, the old woman runs, with one or two a penny hot cross buns' (a version of the once
familiar
street-dry "One-a-penny, two-a penny, hot cross buns'). At this stage the cross was presumably
simply
incised with a knife, rather than piped on in pastry, as is the modern commercial practice. As yet,
too, the
 name of such buns was just cross buns: James Boswell recorded in his Life of Johnson (1791):  9
Apr. An.
1773 Being Good Friday I breakfasted with him and cross-buns.' The fact that they were
generally sold hot,
however, seems to have led by the early nineteenth century to the incorporation of hot into their
name."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 164)
<p>
"The pagans worshipped the goddess Eostre (after whom Easter was named) by serving tiny
cakes, often
decorated with a cross, at their annual spring festival. When archaeologists excavated the ancient
city of
Herculaneum in southwestern Italy, which had been buried under volcanic ask and lava since 79
C.E., they
found two small loaves, each with a cross on it, among the ruins. The English word "bun"
probably came
from the Greek boun, which referred to a ceremonial cake of circular or crescent shape, made of
flour and
honey and offered to the gods. Superstitions regarding bread that was baked on Good Friday date
back to a
very early period. In England particulary, people believed that bread baked on this day could be
hardened in
the oven and kept all year to protect the house from fire. Sailors took leaves of it on their voyages
to prevent
shipwreck, and a Good Friday loaf was often buried in a heap of corn to protect it from rats,
mice, and
weevils. Finely grated and mixed with water, it was sometimes used as a medicine. In England
nowadays,
hot cross buns are served at break are served at breakfast on Good Friday morning. They are
small,
usually spiced buns whose sugary surface is marked with a cross. The English believe that hanging
a hot
cross bun in the house on this day offers protection from bad luck in the coming year. It's not
unusual to see
Good Friday buns or cakes hanging on a rack or in a wire basket for years, gathering dust and
growing
black with mold--although some people believe that if the ingredients are mixed, the dough
prepared, and
the buns baked on Good Friday itself, they will never get moldy."<br>

"Hot cross bun, a round bun made from a rich yeast dough containing flour, milk, sugar, butter,
eggs,
currants, and spices, such as cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves. In England, hot cross buns
are
traditionally eaten on Good Friday; they are marked on top with a cross, wither cut in the dough
or
composed of strips of pastry. The mark is of ancient origin, connected with religious offerings of
bread, which
replaced earlier, less civilized offerings of blood. The Egyptians offered small round cakes,
marked with a
representation of the horns of an ox, to the goddess of the moon. The Greeks and Romans had
similar
practices and the Saxons ate buns marked with a cross in honor of the goddess of light, Eostre,
whose
name was transferred to Easter. According to superstition, hot cross buns and loaves baked on
Good
Friday never went mouldy, and were sometimes kept as charms from one year to the next. Like
Chelsea
buns, hot cross buns were sold in great quantities by the Chelsea Bun House; in the 18th century
large
numbers of people flocked to Chelsea during the Easter period expressly to visit this
establishment."<br>

"Bath buns, hot cross buns, spice buns, penny buns, Chelsea buns, currant buns-all  these  small,
soft,
plump, sweet, fermented' cakes are English institutions...The most interesting of the recipes is
perhaps the
simple spiced fruit bun, the original of our Good Friday hot cross bun without the cross. These
spice buns
first became popular in Tudor days, at the same period as the larger spice loaves or cakes, and
were no
doubt usually made form the same batch of spiced and butter-enriched fruit dough. For a long
time bakers
were permitted to offer these breads and buns for sale only on special occasions, as is shown by
the
following decree, issued in 1592, the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Elizabeth I, by the London
Clerk of the
Markets:  That no bakers, etc, at any time or times hereafter make, utter, or sell by retail, within
or without
their houses, unto any of the Queen's subject any spice cakes, buns, biscuits, or other spice bread
(being
bread out of size and not by law allowed) except it be at burials, or on Friday before Easter, or at
Christmas,
upon pain or forfeiture of all such spiced bread to the poor...If anybody wanted spice bread and
buns for a
private celebration, then, these delicacies had to be made at home. In the time of James I, further
attempts
to prevent bakers from making spice breads and buns proved impossible to enforce, and in this
matter
the bakers were allowed their way. Although for different reasons, the situation now is much as
it was in
the late seventeenth century, spice buns appearing only at Easter--not, to be sure, on Good Friday
when
bakeries are closed, but about a fortnight in advance..."<br>

Sufficient for twenty-four buns." (p. 319-320)

<b>"Good Friday Buns</b><br>
(Commonly called Hot Cross Buns). --Rub a quarter of a pound of butter into two pounds of flour. Add a pinch of salt; then mix a wine-glassful
 of fresh, thick yeast with a pint and a half of warmed milk; and stir these into the flour till it forms a light batter. Put the batter in a warm place
to rise. When sufficiently risen, work into it half a pound of sugar, half a pound of currants, half a nutmeg, grated, and a quarter of an ounce of powdered mace. Knead
these well into the dough, make it up into buns, and place them on buttered baking-tins. Make a cross on them with the black of a knife, brush a little
clarified butter over the top, and let them stand a quarter of an hour before the fire. Bake in a good oven. When bread is made at home, hot cross buns may be made by mixing the currants, &c.
with bread dough after it was risen. Time, one hour to let the dough rise; twenty minutes to bake. Sufficient for two dozen buns. Probable
cost, 1s. 6d. for this quality." (p. 260)<br>

<b>Colomba</b><br>

Colomba is one of several special breads celebrating Easter in Italy. This dove-shaped panettone-like confection is generally described as the most popular Easter bread in the 
country. Some theories exist regarding its genesis. The dove symbolizes spring, Christ, and peace. 
<p>
"The colomba, a pannetone-like sweet bread shaped like a dove, is Italy's best known Easter bread. Originally from Lombardy, it is now 
mass-produced and eaten everywhere in the country." <br>
---"Festivity and Food," <i>Oxford Companion to Italian Food</i>, Gillian Riley [Oxford University Press:New York] 2007 (p. 199) 
<p>
"Colomba pasquale. 'Easter dove.' Dove-shaped Easter cake, said to have been created in Milan to honor the legend of two white 
doves who settled on a Milanese war chariot until the city won the battle of Legnano in 1176. Pavia also claims the cake was created 
in the shape of a dove by a young girl who brought it to the Lombard conqueror of Pavia, Alboin, in 572, who was so impressed that he 
allowed her to go free." <br>
---<i>Dictionary of Italian Food and Drink</i>, John Mariani [Broadway Books:New York] 1998 (p. 79) 
<p>
"Lombardy claims la colomba, a delicate panettone-like sweet bread shaped like a dove. It has become the national Easter bread of Italy and is made 
industrially and shipped all over the country. Even so, many local specialties remain. The dove, a pagan symbol of the coming of 
spring as well as the sign of the Holy Spirit in Catholicism, is the inspiration for a sweet called mascardini in Palermo, pasta raffinata in Noto, 
and caneddate in Syracuse, where it is shaped like a dove sitting with little candies at its base. It tastes nothing like the 
la colomba, for it is made of pasta forte, a mixture of sugar, flour, and water spiced with cinnamon and cloves; some bakers add finely pestled 
almonds." <br>

<a name="kulich">
<b>Kulich</b><br>
"The most famous Russian easter bread, kulich, also has a tall narrow shape. This shape is Slavic
and of great antiquity...The kulich is based on a baba dough, with more sugar, plus additions of
candied peel, almonds, raisins, and saffron. The bulging top is iced and decorated, usually with
Cyrillic letters standing for 'Christ is risen'. Traditionally the kulich is taken to be blessed at
midnight mass on the eve of Easter Sunday. In some families it replaces bread for the entire Holy
Week. It is served with Paskha, a sweetened confection based on curd cheese."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University
Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 266)<p>
<p>
"Russian Easter Loaf. Kulich. Many Russian families still treasure an heirloom recipe for kulich. The traditional loaf is saffron-
flavoured and somewhat dry in texture, but it may also be made rich in butter and cake-like, as in the second recipe below. Old-fashioned
cooks still treat their kulichi very gently upon removal from the oven. They turn the bread out on to a large down-filled pillow
and carefully roll it from side to side until it is completely cool, so that the loaf does not lose its shape. Kulich may be
decorated with a silver or coloured dragees or, for a dramatic effect, crowned with a large red rose."<br>
---<i>A Taste of Russia</i>, Darra Goldstein [Jill Norman Book:London] 1985 (p. 108) [NOTE: this book contains a recipe for Kulich. We can scan/send if you like.]
<p>
"Krendel' and Kulich are ancient festive cakes. They use the same rich yeast dough, to which nuts, spices and dried fruit may be
added, but the krendel' is wound into a figure of eight whereas the kulich is baked in a tall mould like a baba. The first is common at
name-day parties and other celebrations. Kulich appears only at Easter, when it is the pride of the table. In some families it
replaces bread for the entire Holy Week...To bake a kulich you will need a tall cylindrical tin or...a deep round tin which allows
plenty of room for the dough to rise...Kulich should be lightly browned on top when done...A cylindrical kulich is sliced from the top
 in rounds with the first slice preserved as a lid. It is traditionally eaten with paskha, an enriched mixture of curd cheese, 
spices, nuts, dried fruit and sugar. The word paskha means Easter, and the blend of dairy fats celebrates the end of Lenten 
prohibitions."<br>

"Paskha (as sweetened cheese mixture) and kulich (a rich yeast bread with raisins and almonds) were the highlights of the Easter
table. These distinctive desserts were especially savored as they maked the end of the long Long Lenten fast when all meat, egsg, and
dairy products were forbidden to devout Orthodox believers. In the countryside especially, baskets containing colored eggs, paskha, and kulich
were taken to the midnight Church service on Easter Eve. As the worshippers gathered, they stood in the darkness, each with an unlit
taper in hand, waiting for the service to begin. At midnight the priest lit the first taper to mark the resurrection of 
Christ. From this taper, all the others were lit, and soon the entire church was aglow. The priest then led a candlelit procession out of the church
and circled the building three times; he finished by blessing all the dishes and baskets of foods that were arrayed inside and
outside the church. The parishioners reclaimed their baskets of foods and hurried home to begin the Easter festivities."<br>

<blockquote>
<b>[1861]<br>
"Kulich.</b><br>
Prepare dough from 6 lbs flour, 1/2 glass good yeast, and 5 glasses milk heated to the temeprature of milk fresh from the 
cow, or a little warmer. When the dough rises, add 10 egg yolks, 5 whole eggs, about 1 lb melted Finnish butter, 2-3
teacups sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, and [for flavoring] 1/2 teaspoon finely ground cardamom, 10 drops lemon or rose oil, or 1 lot
vanilla drops. Add about 1 glass each raisins and almonds, saving some for decoration. Knead everything together and let rise. 
The dough must be rather thick so that it does not stick at all to the table. When the dough has thoroughly risen, light the oven.
Punch down the dough, shape it into kuliches, and set them to rise in a warm place until the oven is completely ready. There is no 
need whatsoever to hurry to set the kuliches in the oven. Before baking, they need to rise fully, which can take rather a long time because of
the heavy dough. After the kuliches have risen, paint them with an egg beaten with milk and decorate with raisins and whole or
shredded almonds. Almost everyone likes these kuliches; the dough is completely different from a bun dough (bulochnoe). Saffron kulich
is made exactly the same, except the cardamom is omitted. For these proportions add 1/2 teaspoon saffron ground into a powder. Before using the
saffron, wrap it well in paper so that it does not lose its fragrance and dry it out in a very warm oven. Mash with butter [when you use it].
More or less saffron may be added according to taste.<br>
