<font size="4" color="#003366">Where are they located?</font><br>
<a href="http://www.statcounter.com">Statcounter</a> tracks Food Timeline patrons by country
and city. Results vary according to time, day, and month. Over half of our readers are based in the USA.
<p>
<font size="4" color="#003366">When do FT readers visit?</font><br>
There is a predictable rhythm to FT usage. In the mornings (7AM New Jersey Time) our
European and South Pacific patron counts are significantly higher. This wanes as the day
progresses 
and U.S. patrons come online. Statcounter reveals most FT hits are made in the beginning of the
week and slack off as the weekend approaches. School year (September-June) is busier than
summer. Holiday planning periods are busy, but real-time holiday traffic is almost non-existent.
<p>
<font size="4" color="#003366">Site visits vs. reader interaction</font><br>
Statcounter confirms between June 5, 2004-May 1, 2013 Food Timeline pages have been
loaded 31 million times. We
invite our readers to ask questions and they do! Since the site's inception (March 1999) we have
answered 25,000+ food questions sent from all points of the globe. Question traffic
does not always corrolate neatly with site visit stats. Sunday evenings during the American school
year may not report significant visit stats but they are exceptionally busy for FT questions. Why?
Students (surprise?!) leave their homework to the last minute. Media attention sometimes generates 
temporary service "spikes." Blog entries (reddit.com, I-am-bored.com,
roadfood forum) can surge thousands of hits on FT for a nano-blip of time. Think:
Warhol's 15 minutes of fame. 
<p>
<font size="4" color="#003366">What about social media?</font><br>
We <a href="http://twitter.com/foodtimeline/">tweet</a> & <a href="http://pinterest.com/foodtimeline/">pin</a> to reach
people who prefer accessing information in this format. FT answers/exchanges generally exceed SMS character limits and we
respect our patron's privacy. <a href="foodfaqa.html#super">E-Mail</a> remains the best way for us to correspond with readers in 2013. Also lets us 
scan/send information. FT editor is on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/lynneolver">LinkedIn</a>.
<p>
<font size="4" color="#003366">Market strategy</font><br>
If you fill a niche, people will come. Pure and simple. Our site began as a public educational
service and so it remains. We have never paid seach engines for premium placement, solicited
reciprocal links, partnered with book vendors, or sold advertising. FT traffic grows because we add (credible/vetted) content readers want 
and answer their questions
in a timely manner. We still hand code html & today's readers comment the site is "ugly." We acknowledge: what was cutting 
edge in 1999 is now stale.
Conversley? FT looks so old it's become vintage. Medium & content blend perfectly. Quick load across all platforms turns out to be
 a major plus. FT readers are truly amazed to get personalized answers from Web sites. Lesson here: if you invite customers to ask questions, you better respond!
