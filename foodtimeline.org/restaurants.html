 <a name="foodservice">
  Historians tell us the genesis of food service dates back to ancient times. Street vendors and public
  cooks (caterers) were readily available in Ancient Rome. Medieval travelers dined at inns, taverns,
  monestaries and hostelries. Colonial America continued this tradition in the form of legislated Publick
  Houses. The restaurant, as we know it today, is said to have been a byproduct of the French Revolution.
  Modern food service is a product of the Industrial Revolution. Advances in technology made possible mass
  production of foodstuffs, quick distribution of goods, safer storage facilities, and more efficient cooking
  appliances. Advances in transportation (most notably trains, automobiles, trucks) also created a huge
  demand for public dining venues. Another thought to ponder: how military foodservice impacted
  civilian industry.
<p>
"Foodservice organizations in operation in the United States today have become an accepted way of life, and we tend to regard them
as relatively recent innovations. However, they have their roots in the habits and customs that characterize our
civilization and predate the Middle Ages. Certain phases of foodservice operations reach a well-organized from as early as 
feudal times...Religious orders and royal households were among the earliest practitioners of quantity food production...Records
show that the food preparation carried out by the abbey brethren reached a much higher standard than food served in the inns
at that time...The royal household, with its hundreds of retainers, and the households of nobles, often numbering as many as 150
to 250 persons, also necessitated an efficient foodservice...In providing for the various needs, strict cost accounting was 
necessary, and here, perhaps, marks the beginning of the present-day scientific foodservice cost accounting..."<br>

While public eateries existed in <a href="restaurants.html#romanfast">Ancient Rome</a> and <a href="restaurants.html#chineserestaurants">Sung Dynasty China</a>, restaurants (we know them today), are generally credited
to 18th century France. The genesis is quite interesting and not at all what most people expect. Did you
know the word <i>restaurant</i> is derived from the French word <i>restaurer</i>  which
means to
restore? The first French restaurants [pre-revolution] were not fancy gourmet establishments run
by ex-aristocratic chefs. They were highly regulated establishments that sold restaurants (meat based consommes intended to "restore"
a person's strength) to people who were not feeling well. Cook-caterers (traiteurs) also served
hungry patrons. The history of these two professions is historically connected and often difficult
to distinguish.
<p>
According to the current edition of Larousse Gastronomque (p. 194-5), the first cafes (generally defined
as places selling drinks and snacks) was established in Constantinople in 1550. It was a
<a href="restaurants.html#coffee">coffee house</a>, hence the word "cafe." Cafes were places educated people went to share ideas and new 
discoveries. Patrons spent several hours in these establishments in one "sitting." This trend caught
on in Europe on the 17th century. When cafes opened in France they also sold brandy, sweetened
wines and liqueurs in addition to coffee. The first modern-type cafe was the Cafe Procope which
opened in 1696.
<p>
The French Revolution launched the modern
the restaurant industry. It relaxed the legal rights of guilds that [since the Middle Ages] were
licensed by the king to control specific foods [eg. the Patissiers, Rotisseurs, Charcutiers] and
created a hungry,
middle-class customer base who relished the ideals of egalitarianism (as in, anyone who could pay the
price could get the same meal).  Entrepreneurial French chefs were quick to capitalize on this
market. <a href="restaurants.html#menus">Menus</a>, offering dishes individually portioned, priced and prepared to order, were introduced to the public
for the first time.
<p>
<b>Who started the first restaurant?</b> <br>
There are (at least) three theories:<p>
<b>1. Boulanger, 1765</b><br>
"In about 1765, a Parisian 'bouillon seller' named Boulanger wrote on his sign: 'Boulanger sells
restoratives
fit for the gods'...This was the first restaurant in the modern sense of the term."<br>
---<i>Larousse Gastronomiqe</i>, completely revised and updated [Clarkson Potter:New York]
1999 (p.
978)
<p>
<b>2. Mathurin Roze de Chantoiseau in Paris, 1766</b><br>
"According to Spang, the forgotten inventor was Mathurin Roze de Chantoiseau, a figure so
perfectly emblematic of his
time that he almost seems like an invention himself. The son of a landowner and merchant, Roze
moved to Paris in the
early 1760s and began floating a variety of schemes he believed would enrich him and his country
at the same
time."<br>
http://dir.salon.com/books/review/2000/03/24/spang/index.html
<p>
<b>3. Beauvilliers, 1782</b><br>
"However, the first Parisian restaurant worthy of the name was the one founded by Beauvilliers in
1782 in
the Rue de Richelieu, called the Grande Taverne de Londres. He introduced the novelty of listing
the dishes
available on a menu and serving them at small individual tables during fixed hours."<br>

<b>About restaurants</b>


<br>
"...France was the birthplace of what we now call the restaurant...this happened toward the end of
the eighteenth century. With the exception of inns, which were primarily for travelers, and street
kitchens...where in Europe at that time could one purchase a meal outside the home? Essentially
in places where alcoholic begerages were sold, placesewquipped to serve simple, inexepensive
dishes either cooked on the premises or ordered from a nearby inn or food shop, along with wine,
beer, and spirits, which constituted the bulk of their business. Such tavern-restaurants existed not
only in France but also in other countries. In Germany, Austria, and Alsace, Brauereien and
Weinstuben served delicatessen, sauerkraut, and cheese, for example; in Spain bodegas served
tapas. Greek taverns served various foods with olive oil..where meals were exempt from taxes,
served a variety of fortifying dishes such as stews, meat with sauce, and organ meats...All of these
places...were apt to serve plain and simple fare rather than more elaborate culinary creations...For
a genuine meal one had to look either to a good inn or go to a rotisseur or traiteur (caterer, from
the Italian trattorie). In France, these two guilds, together with the charcutiers, had been granted a
monopoly on all cooked meat other than pates...Only common people actually ate in the traiteur's
shop, perhaps seated at a table reserved for guests in some establishments. Even a moderately
well-to-do person would have preferred to order food delivered to a private home or a room at an
inn or hotel or an elegant salon rented for the occasion...In 1765 a man by the mame of Boulanger, also known as
"Champ d'Oiseaux" or "Chantoiseau," opened a shop near the Louvre...There he sold what e called <i>restaurants</i> or
<i>bouillons restaurants</i>--that is, meat-based consommes intended to "restore" a person's strength. Ever since the late
Middle Ages the word <i>restaurant</i> had been used to describe any of a variety of rich bouillons made with
chicken, beef, roots or one sort or antoher, onions, herbs, and, according to some recipes, spices, crystallized sugar,
toasted bread, barley, butter, and even exotic ingredients..."<br>
---"The Rise of the Restaurant," Food: a Culinary History, Jean-Louis Flandrin & Massimo
Montanari [Columbia University Press:New York] 1999(p. 471-480)
<p>
"Restaurant...The word appeared in the 16th century and meant at first a food which  "restores"
(from restaurer, to restore), and was used more specifically for a rich, highly flavoured soup
thought capable of restoring lost strength...Until the late 18th century, the only places for ordinary
people to eat out were inns and taverns. In about 1765, a Parisian   "boullion-seller" named
Boulanger wrote on his sign:  Boulanger sells restoratives "fit for the gods"...This was the first
restaurant in the modern sense of the term. Boulanger was followed by Roze and Pontaille, who
in 1766 opened a maison de sante (house of health). However, the first Parisian restaurant worthy
of the name was the one founded by Beauvilliers in 1782...called the Grand Taverne de Londres.
He introduced the novelty of listing the dishes available on a menu and served them at small
individual tables during fixed hours. One beneficial effect of the Revolution was that the abolition
of the guilds and their privileges made it easier to open a restaurant. The rest to take advantage of
the situation were the cooks and servants from the great houses, whose aristocratic owners had
fled. Moreover, the arrival in Paris of numerous provincials who had no family in the capital
created a pool of faithful customers, augmented by the journalists and businessmen. The general
feeling of well-being under the Directory, following such a chaotic period, coupled with the
chance of enjoying the delights of the table hitherto reserved for the rich, created an atmosphere
in which restaurants became an established institution."<br>
---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, completely revised and updated edition [Clarkson
Potter:New York]  2001 (p. 978)
<p>
"The Restaurant Revolution<br>
An eye-witness, Grimod de La Reyniere advances three reasons why restaurants emerged in
France with the French Revolution: the rage for English fashions, including the taking of meals in
taverns; the influx of large numbers of revolutionary deputies from the provinces; and cooks
seeking re-employment after the break-up of the aristocratic households....We need to remember
that the near universal way to serve meals until this time [1825] was to place the pot of pots on
the table for all to share. The grander the meal, the more dishes. In fancy dining, the artistic
creation was at the table...Hotels served limited ranges at fixed time...The caterers (traiteurs) did
not provide portions, but  whole courses'--an entire joint, say--and  anyone who whished to
entertain a few friends must order them well in advance'. With the restaurant, artistic creation
became the individual plate. In one blow, high quqlity became publicly available; even more
significantly, cooking/sharing was individualized...Restaurants hastened the emergence of the
sovereign consumer. At the table of a first-class
restauranteur, any person could dine as well as a prince..."<br>

"Restaurant. According to contemporary dictionaries, a restaurant is simply an eating place, an
establishment where meals are served to customers. By this definition, restaurants--by whatever
name they have been given--are almost as old as civilization. The ruins of Pompeii contain the
remnants of a tavern which provided foods and wines to passers-by...the prime function to these
early  eating places' was to cater to the needs of people away from home who, unless they had
brought their own food and cooks with them, were obliged to take whatever was available--or go
hungry. From the second half of the 17th century there were cafes, public places where people
could meet and talk, eat and drink....In England there were also taverns which, catering to a
socially superior clientele, employed well-known cooks and offered an extensive choice of dishes. 
     The restaurant, as it was conceived in Paris towards the end of the 18th century, had a
different vocation. Its principal advantage was that it offered diners a choice: according to
Brillat-Savarin [he was lawyer and gourmand who wrote the Physiology of Taste], restaurants
allowed people to eat when they wanted, what they wanted, and how much they wanted, knowing
in advance how much this would cost. The top restaurants of the day boasted a vast menu, with a
choice of 12 soups, 65 entrees...and 50 desserts. Prior to this, French catering was highly
regulated and shared between various corporations [guilds]...The regulations surrounding these
trades gave each one certain privileges. The rotisseur, for example, roasted meat but was not
allowed to bake dishes in the oven, nor to make  ragouts'[stews]...By 1771 the world
 restauranteur' was defined...as  someone who has the art of preparing true broths, known as
 restaurants', and the right to sell all kinds of custards, dishes of rice, vermicelli and macaroni, egg
dishes, boiled capons, preserved and stewed fruit and other delicious and health-giving
foods...The word  restaurant', used to describe an eating house, first appeared in a decree of
1786...Restaurants were...an important consequence of the Revolution and concurred with its
aims in promoting egality around the table. Eating was no longer the privilege of the wealthy who
could afford to maintain a cook and a well-supplied kitchen."<br>

<b>Restaurants in early America</b>
<br>
<a href="../www.foodtimeline.org/foodcolonial.html#tavernfare">Colonial taverns and inns</a> sold food, but they were not generally
known for their cuisine. Nor was the food offered on menus. The French restaurant concept was introduced to the newly
established USA in the very last years of the 18th century. Food historians place the genesis of grand city
restaurants, often based in fine hotels, to the first quarter of the 19th century. 
<p>
"The French Revolution encouraged the growth of restaurants by abolishing the monopolistic
cooks' guilds and by forcing the aristocrats' former chefs to find new, proletarian uses for their
talents...Travelers to France excitedly brought the news of these Parisian restaurants to an
American public that already enjoyed a spiritual kinship with France ever since that country allied
itself with our own Revolution. French culture had already had a considerable effect on our
own...This affinity for French cooking convinced a former cook to the archbishop of Bordeaux to
open his own French-style eating house in Boston in 1794. His name was Jean Baptiste Gilbert
Payplat, and he called his establishment by his nickname, "Jullien's Restarator," where he became
known as the "Prince of Soups," echoing the original meaning of the word "retaurant."...But the
growth of the concept of freestanding restaurants depended ultimately upon a large enough
number of people willing to accept it and pay for it. In 1800 the total population of New York,
Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore, and Charleston combined was only 200,000, but soon it began to
soar. New York grew fastest--160,000 inhabitants by 1825...By 1805 New York had four
coffeehouses, four oyster houses, four tea gardens, two victualing houses, and a cookshop, as
well as forty-two combination boardinghouses and taverns and these increased rapidly for absorb
the new prosperity...The food available in these new eating houses--which went in and out of
business at an amazing rate of failure--continued to be for the most part coarse, heavy, and of
mediocre or poor quality. Game was plentiful, including venison, pigeon, racoon, and elk. Turtle
was considered a delicacy...Fresh meat went bad quickly, so many workers slaughtered the pigs
that freely roamed the streets consuming refuse, and Broadway was lined with vendors selling
roast pork. Others hawked oysters, fast becoming a passion with Americans...Once the food was
set on the table, the customers tore into it with what one observer called "inconceivable rapidity,"
and other defined as a technique of "gobble, gulp and go." This was pretty much the standard
procedure in most eating houses and taverns. Even in the grand, new, modern hotels like New
York City's Hotel (1794), a service philosophy of "come-and-get-it" was accepted as normal, and
communal dining rooms serving up fixed meals at set hours were till the rule, although the
spendiferous Tremont House in Boston, which opened in 1828, inaugurated "French Service" in
its two-hundred-seat dining room, where guests might dine at individual tables and use th new
four-tined fork. By the 1830s the "American Plan," by which travelers were forced to pay for
room and board whether they ate a meal or not, was becoming standard in the hotel industry. In
lesser hotels and taverns, it was not so much a question of "come-and-get-it" as it was
"try-to-to-eat-it." <br>

"Restauranteurs vs Traiteurs<br>
While competing in the marketplace, cooks have, since ancient times, formed guilds. A little
booklet of <i>Notes on the History of the Company of the Mistery of Cooks of London</i>,
published by the Cooks' Company perhaps in the early 1960s, dates the Fraternity's formation to
1311-12. The trades regulated themselves and were regulated in terms of fair trading and health,
were taxed and given some protection by the City and crown. That is, they operated as a
profession, with its mutual promotion and restrictive trade practices--limiting entry through (often
exploited) apprenticeships, sharing tricks of the trade, and fixing prices...The guild of
cook-caterers, the cuisiniers, paralleled the hierarchy in the court kitchens...Do not forget we are
talking about public cooks: cuisiniers are not to be confused with queues, master cooks employed
in noble households and convents. Furthermore, the guild of cuisiners was forever splitting and
being challenged by new specializations...The tradesmen sold goods to be carried away, but a
further offshoot of the cuisiners was the traiteurs--eating-house keepers or caterers. They were
popular with the modest people, for they sold small quantities at low prices. From statutes in
1559, they specialized in weddings and banquets, held on their own premises or elsewhere...When
Antoine Beauvilliers opened the first great restaurant, La Grande Taverne de Londres--in 1782,
according to Brillat-Savarin, and in 1786 according to others--a new trade, deriving partly from
English taverns, had broken from the the traiteurs...The caterers had an exclusive right to sell
cooked meat dishes, but limited themselves to selling whole cuts of meat, not an individual
helping. That monopoly was contested in 1765 by Boulanger, a seller of bouillons. While the
traiteurs claimed the exclusive right to sell ragout, stock fell outside their monopoly and was sold
under the name restaurant, in the sense of  restorative'."<br>

"When he went to Paris in the early eighteenth century, Joachim Nemeitz quickly discovered what
was wrong with the French capital: the food...Forced to eat at an innkeeper's or traiteur's
(cook-caterer's) table d'hote, the simple visitor to Paris would soon discover that he "does not fare
well
at all, either because the meat is not properly cooked, or because they serve the same thing every
day and rarely offer any variety."...Throughout the eigheenth century, many a traveler would have
cause for similar complaints...food served by French innkeepers and cook-caterers, though
inexpensive, would further ruin...health...For centuries before the first restaurants opened their
doors, travelers and Parisians without their own kitchens had depended upon the inns, cookshops,
and wineshops...Early eighteenth-century Paris was, in fact, home to thousands of retail food and
drink merchants, all organized by monarchial decrees into twenty-five different guilds. As defined
in their statutes, the retail food trades were characterized by extreme divisiveness and
exaggerateed compartmentalism...Master cook-caterers held the right to serve full meals to large
parties...The cook-caterers (traiteurs), it is said, quickly brought legal charges against one
particularly aggrandizing restauranteur named Boulanger who dared to sell a dish (sheeps' feet in
white sauce) that was not a restaurant but a ragout (anything composed of several different
ingredients and cooked in sauce). After a series of appeals, we are told, the courts eventually
decided in favor of the cook-caterers, and restricted the "restauranteurs" to selling bouillons...The
retail food trades were notoriously difficult to delimit, The futility of enforcing divisions among
the food trades derived in part form the combinative nature of the work itself...Already in 1704,
almost three-quarters of the master traiteurs were also cabaret-keepers; in 1748 the traiteurs'
guild noted that "most of our masters" also have the privileges of pastrycooks or
roast-meat-sellers...A 1760 decision of Parliment instructed that, in order to prevent monopolies,
the Paris
caterers should henceforth elect their four "syndics in charge"...The combination of titles, while
fairly common in all the retail food trades, was particularly prevalent among the traiteurs. It is
evident that the cook-caterers of Paris had long had their fingers in numerous pies, and that by far
the majority of them would have been well within their legal rights had they run businesses that
sold a variety of foods and a wide range of potables. Such an accumulation of tasks was easily
possible, but it did not distinguish the first restauranteurs from the established cook-caterers.
Indeed, many of the first restauranteurs were also master traiteurs with close business ties to many
of the other established Paris food and drink trades."

<b>African American caterers</b><br>
Historic newspapers and scholarly articles provide but brief glimpses into the catering businesses run by blacks in the late 19th century. 
They do confirm general observations regarding being edged out by new immigrant arrivals. W.E.B. Dubois observed and studied this trend.

"The African Amercian caterers in particular were comparatively well-to-do; they employed other members of their community,
met with prominent white families, and were social leaders and noted abolitionists...Philadelphia caterers developed
reputations for particular dishes, such as  terrapin stew and chicken croquettes, which were seen as African American specialties
and prestigious foods on the tables of socially prominent white families...African Americans continued to dominate the catering
business in northeastern cities into the 1890s...African American caterers also held positions of respect in southern cities
throughout the era of segregation."<br>

"For more than  a century the Negro has cominated the catering field in Philadelphia. Thsi buisness has been intimately linked
with the history of the Quaker City from its earliest days until the present. One of the first successful Negro ctaerers was Peter
Augustine, who started and establishment on Third street above Spruce in 1816. His fame was world-wide. Often he sent his terrapin for
which he was noted, to Paris. The firm of Augustine & Baptiste, his successor, continues to provide eatables for some of 
Philadelphia's oldest and wealthiest famlies. For 100 years this business has been kept in the family. Mrs. Clara Augustine and Miss
Tillie Baptiste now conduct it on Fifteenth street, betwen Locust and Walnut streets. Among others of the old guild of caterers was
Thomas J. Dorsey whose culianry accomplishments won for him both name and wealth. Henry Jones was equally as well known and
successful. James Prosser was given credit for being one of the pioneer caterers and is said to have systematized and
stabilized the business. His establishment was at Fourth and Market streets. A contemporary of Prosser was James Porter Sr., who
conducted a restaurant at Eighth and Market strets. He was the first steward of the exclusive Philadelphia Club, which in the beginning
was housed in the old Napoleon residence on Ninth street above Spruce. George Porter, a son, was associated with him. Prominent 
Negro caterers in Philadelphia of a later date were Henry Minton at Fourth and Chestnut streets and subsequently Twelfth street, near 
Walnut and Richard Thompkins on Fourth street, near Walnut. The catering and restaurant business was brought to a degree of 
perfection by these men of antebellum days and by many who followed. Years ago the Negroes practially controlled these 
profitable avenues of endeavor and were materially responsible for Philadelphia becoming famous as 'a city of good food.'

<center><font size="5" color="#003366"><b>Personal chefs & private cooks</b></font></center><p>
The rich and famous have long enjoyed the services of personal chefs. Until recently, personal chefs were retained by wealthy families, royalty, top government officials, prosperous businessmen, and the like. Personal chefs traveled with their employers, serving them in battlefields, summer retreats, foreign lands, and voyages. Napoleon's personal chef is reputed to have invented Chicken Marengo for his finicky boss on the battlefield. Jacques Pepin traveled with Charles De Gaulle as his personal chef. Oprah Winfrey's personal chef was elevated to adjunct celebrity status by helping her employer lose weight. 
<p>
The modern American personal/private chef industry descends from this grand culinary tradition. After World War II America entered an age of economic growth. Baby Boomers reaped the benefits of higher education and unprecedented job opportunities. Those attaining "Yuppie" status freely spent their newly acquired wealth on expensive goods and premium services. Savvy entrepreneurs capitalized on the growing demand for specialized personal services. Personal financial planners, personal trainers, personal nutritionists, personal shoppers, personal party planners, & related fields proliferated. Personal and private chefs took the general 
concept of catering (cooks for hire) from special occasion to everyday. Before long, having one's own personal chef was THE ultimate status symbol. Brand-name chefs were actively recruited for lucrative positions. 
<p>
The industry mushroomed as people with cooking experience seeking alternative work opportunities were drawn into the mix. Both chefs and clients grew at a remarkable pace. When the economy slowed in the 1990s, the personal chef industry reinvented itself. Chefs began to penetrate the middle class market, targeting dual-income career couples. The new hooks were economics (less expensive option that eating out), health (balanced, specialized diets), and convenience (professional meals ready to heat). The economic problems facing our country today [2009] present significant hardship for the personal chef industry. New clients are difficult to source. Old clients are scaling back or dropping this service altogether. Time for another reinvention. 

<b>Personal vs Private chef?(industry definitions):</b><br>
"What is the difference between a personal chef and a private chef? A private chef is employed by one individual or family full time, and often lives in, preparing up 
to three meals per day. A personal chef serves several clients, usually one per day, and provides multiple meals that are custom-designed for the clients’ particular 
requests and requirements. These meals are packaged and stored, so that the client may enjoy them at his or her leisure in the future...Who hires personal chefs? 
The typical client mix includes two-income couples with or without children, career-focused individuals, those with special dietary or health needs, seniors and those
 who enjoy fine dining. How many personal chefs are out there? The current number of personal chefs is estimated at 9,000 serving 72,000 customers. Industry 
observers predict the number will double in the next 5 years. What do personal chefs do? Personal chefs design and execute menus for clients. They plan, purchase 
and prepare meals (usually once a week) either at the clients’ home or in a rented professional kitchen. Meals are packaged and stored, either in the clients’ 
refrigerator or freezer with heating-instruction labels."<br>---<a href="http://www.personalchef.com/personal_chef_faqs.php">American Personal and Private 
Chef Association</a>
<p>
"While there are many similarities between personal chefs and private chefs, it's important that we distinguish between these two culinary professions. A private chef 
is one who is employed by a specific person or organization exclusively. She earns a paycheck and is responsible for providing her culinary services to one person 
or group. She works scheduled hours, cooks menus to satisfy the needs of her employer, whether a family or an organization...a personal chef is a chef for hire who
 works for herself as a small business operator. There is no exclusivity agreement involved, and she can choose the number of clients with whom she will associated
 and for whom she will prepare custom menues. As the profession began to gain popularity among culinarians and the attention of the media, many critics called 
personal chefs a fad profession that would be around only as long as it was fashionable. However, over time, this supposed fad became a trend and gave chefs and 
cooks around the world the opportunity to work with food on their own terms. The personal chef trend has become a legitimate career path in the culinary industry
 and a viable alternative career for culinarians looking to leave traditional cooking situations."<br>

<p>
<b>Who was the first personal chef?</b><br>
Industry experts do not credit a particular person with this honor. Candy Wallace, founder ot the American Personal and Private Chef Association, states: 
<p>
"Culinary history has not officially recorded when the first personal chef opened his doors for business. Was it hundreds of years ago, when a talented chef cooked 
for several affluent families traveling from one estate to another? Or was the first personal chef someone who cooked for a friend's family that had fallen on hard 
times and needed help with the day-to-day chores of the household? History provides us with clues, but determining when the personal chef profession emerged is 
open to discussion." <br>---<i>Professional Personal Chef</i> (p. 1)

"A Personal Chef. A Chicago company called Room Service has been offering "white glove dining in your home" since February. Bob Horwitz, a partner and vice
 president, figures he has it easier than a Southern California delivery service because "I can cover 12,000 people in one block. Out there, it would probably be that 
many in 10 miles." Room Service's partners raised $750,000 to open the business, which delivers selections from eight well-known Chicago restaurants in 10 
specially equipped vans costing $26,000 each. Driven by waiters or waitresses, they are stocked with heating ovens, refrigerators and running water. Within an
 hour of a customer's phone order, a tuxedo-clad Room Service employee picks up a slightly undercooked meal from the restaurant of choice and delivers it to
 home, office or apartment. There, the waiter or waitress sets up the meal, complete with placements, napkins, heavy-duty plastic cutlery, salt and pepper and wet
 towels. Most meals (at an average cost per delivery of $35) require a few extra minutes of cooking time. Horwitz said the service, for which the customer is 
charged 20% over the menu price plus a $3 delivery fee, is geared to upper-income customers....In Philadelphia, Steve Poses, a restaurateur and caterer, recently added a service called Personal Chef to his 
Commissary restaurant and takeout operation. "Today everyone needs a personal chef," he said. "Unfortunately, not everyone can afford one." The service sets up

"Two incompatible types emerged in the 1980's: the couch potato and the insatiable restaurant goer. But by the dawn of the 90's, a few fortnate people were
 finding a way to reconcile their interests in staying at home and their desire to enjoy good food: hire a chef. Personal, or private, chefs have joined that arsenal of 
service people, from personal trainers to personal bankers, that smooth the lives of today's rich and famous and, increasingly, more down-to-earth professionals,
 too. Some chefs...are working full time for the wealthy and he well known, even living in their houses. But others may cook dinners only a few evenings a week for
 professional singles or couples, or just come in for special occasions. Carole Rydell, placement coordinator at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, 
N.Y., said she saw a slow, steady increase in the number of requests the school received for private chefs in the last seven years. 'We get requests from wealthy 
people for someone to serve on their yacht,' she said. 'But at the lowest end, we get requests from doctors and lawyers and people in finance and advertising who 
entertain a lot for business or social reasons.' She said the requests increase during the summer, when people hire chefs for their vacation or weekend homes."<br>

"Pursuing Rosie Daley through a supermarket takes some agility. She zips through the produce section at Whole Foods Market like a kid in a candy shop, grabbing

 flowers and, later, bags of bulk whole-wheat flour and other grains. There's reason to tail her: Daley is Oprah Winfrey's personal chef. She knows what Winfrey

"When Stephanie Hersh got her fist job as a private chef for a family of four in Milton, Mass., in 1989, she did what she though private chefs do: she spent each day 
preparing haute cuisine for dinner. At the end of the first week, her employer sat her down and said they needed to talk about menus. As Ms. Hersh recalled it, her
 employer was reassuring but firm, telling her: 'Not that this hasn't been wonderful--it's jut not the way we eat. We like foods like macraoni and cheese and meatloaf
 and lasagna.'...Ms. Hersh promptly switched gears and began making simpler meals. There was a time when private chefs provided five-course meals for the
 leisure class. Now, both the clientele and the cuisine are changing. Because of time-crunched, nutritionally conscious, two-career families, a new breed of private 
chef has been spawned: one who goes into a home and cooks affordable meals that are meant to appeal to those who are tired of restaurant and takeout food. 
Now, there is even a business-support association for those wishing to start a personal chef service: the United States Personal Chef Association, which has 650 
members in 46 states. It was founded in 1991 by David MacKay and his wife, Susan Titcomb, who is a personal chef in Albuquerque, N.M. Work as a personal
 chef usually offers an easier life than in restaurants. Four days a week, Nancy Davis, a former restaurant chef who runs a personal chef service in Austin, Tex.,
 called Chef on the Run, dons her chef fatigues, loads her car with cooking equipment and groceries, and spends the day cooking in clients' kitchens--a venue she 
says she vastly prefers to a restaurant kitchen, with its high stress level and nighttime hours, which makes social life difficult. Ms. davis leaves 10 individually 
packaged entrees wand side dishes for two in the refrigerators of those clients who are on an every-there-week schedule. Her portions are large, and clients 
sometimes stretch two meals from one. Although she makes things like lemon-grass chicken and crayfish enchiladas, she will also accommodate blander palates. 
Her charge is $260 for 10 meals for two people...It often happens that clients who are initially skeptical about the prospect of a stranger in their kitchen cooking
 what they fear could turn out to be no more than expensive Lean Cuisine quickly become converts to the luxury of sitting down to professionally prepared meals 
withing minutes of arriving home from work...'When you look at the economics, it's a bargain compared to going out to eat three times a week,'...'Even so, most 
people regard us as somewhat extravagant, and the notion of having someone come to your home to cook is considered a but much.'...Members of the 
United States Personal Chef Association are not required to be trained chefs--though some are--and they range from retired jewelers to hairdressers and former 
military personnel."<br>

only 1,000 American families employed cooks 10 years ago compared with at least 100,000 families today. Cooking schools ike Peter Kump in New York have
 established referral services. Dozens of personal-chef placement services have sprung up, primarily in large cities..'I was out with several well-known chefs, and
 as 
we left the restaurant, I heard one rich guy say 'There goes so and so. He's my chef,'...'Can you imagine that? Wealthy people used to put chefs in business by 
backing their restaurants. Now forget about the restaurant--they just want to own the chef.'. Al Martino, who owns Chef's International, a placement service in 
New York says that former assistants to celebrity chefs like Daniel Boulud, Alice Waters and Wolfgang Puck are in the highest demand. 'The very young and newly
 rich haven't lived long enough to educate their taste,' Martino says. 'Employing a brand-name private chef is a way of appearing to have taste.'"<br>

"Local cooking school officials and industry groups say a raging stock market, strong economy and long workdays have left people with more cash and less time, 
feeding the demand for personal chefs whose cuisine ranges from Asian fusion to macaroni and cheese. The product of a prosperous, health-crazed age, personal 
chefs have been popular on both coasts and now are gaining grounding the Midwest. "The more two-income households there are, the more people you find
 looking for personal chefs," said Tara Foulks, director of career services at the Cooking and Hospitality Institute of Chicago. The number of people seeking 
personal cooks through the school has roughly tripled in the last two years, Folks said. Once reserved for the aristocracy, chefs are cooking for a different clientele 
these days: health-conscious upper-middle-class parents and professionals sick of skipping meals or gorging themselves on fast food. According to the American 
Personal Chef Association (yes, there is one), some 100,000 U.S. households are sitting down to professionally cooked meals at home."<br>

"Personal chefs are a growing specialty -- and the ultimate in convenience foods. They take care of everything -- the meal planning, shopping, cooking and cleanup.
 Organized through the United States Personal Chefs Association (USPCA), the profession attracts people who love to cook and are good at it but don't want the 
stress and long hours of restaurant kitchens or the high pressure and late nights of catering. As personal chefs they get the good parts of cooking for a living -- the 
smiles on their clients' faces and the thank you's. They also get to control their own schedules.Born in the boom years, the USPCA has grown from about 500
 people in 1995 to about 5,000 in all 50 states today, including about 100 in the Washington metropolitan area. Despite the current economic slowdown, aspiring 
personal chefs continue to fill up the organization's classes. Maybe that's because personal chefs don't just cook for millionaires. Their clients range from families 
with two working parents and too little time to cook, to singles who like good food but don't know how to cook, to people on special diets for medical reasons. 
Although USPCA chefs usually charge a set fee for their whole package (four portions each of five different dinner entrees), that fee is generally based on the 
estimated cost of a mid-priced restaurant meal in their locality. In the Washington area that means $17 to $21 per person, one of the highest in the country. It's not a
 paltry sum but it's well under the cost of many restaurant tabs."<br>

"A power shift is astir in America's kitchens, and it has nothing to do with those little buttons on your blender. In the not-too-distant future, the country's most 
sought-after chefs may no longer be the celebs overseeing trendy urban restaurants and starring in TV cooking shows. Takeout food from restaurants and grocery 
stores may no longer be the automatic in-a-pinch choices for the harried, hungry masses. There may not even be a pinch. The emerging pacesetters are chefs who
 cook in customers' homes and empower them to specify the cuisine, menus, calorie content, spicing levels and dinner hour. These pros more closely resemble your
 grandmother than Escoffier: They also do your shopping, wash the dishes, even take out the garbage. They're graduating from cooking schools by the hundreds, 
and they are beginning to reshape the chef-diner relationship. "This is the kitchen equivalent of day care," says Clark Wolf, a New York-based food and restaurant 
consultant. "Just as we have accepted other people taking care of our kids with our instructions, we have accepted other people cooking for us with our
 instructions." What people want the most isn't found in any restaurant or grocery store. "What I'm selling people is time, not so much food, or I'm selling them 
health," says Jan Sims, who runs the 7-month-old personal chef service And What's for Dinner in Topeka, Kan. The mouth- filling slogan for her business: "Meals
 Like Mom Made, Made in Your Place to Your Taste." When in-home chef services came to national attention in the mid- 1990s, the prime customer base was
 affluent couples, usually with families. But the number of personal chefs has mushroomed since then, and today they're increasingly filtering into mainstream markets
 such as Sunbelt retirement communities and middle-class homes in the heartland. The United States Professional Chef Association, one of the industry's largest
 training and certifying organizations, places the number of full-time in-home chefs at 6,000, and the customers using them at 100,000 or more. Five years ago,
 "there were maybe just a few hundred personal chefs," says the association's president, David MacKay. "Today they're in every state and in every city above 
50,000 (population)." A cottage industry As the number of in-home chefs has grown, the profession has taken on some of the trappings of a cottage industry. Most 
services are solo operations, sometimes advertised in free supermarket-shopper newspapers or by note cards pinned to bulletin boards. The chefs usually have at
 least an associate's degree (or the equivalent) from a culinary school. A service with 20 clients can bring in $30,000 to $40,000 a year. Typically, personal chefs
 visit a home once or twice a month. They prepare a dozen or more meals at a time and store them in the refrigerator or freezer for the client to reheat later. Clients
 pay about $14 to $20 per person per meal (usually a meat, starch and vegetable), with extras negotiable."<br>

"Most personal chefs take food and cookware to a client's home, prepare a couple of weeks' worth of meals, some of which are frozen, and leave the place spic
 and span. Others cook and package meals at a commercial kitchen, since [Westchester County, NY] health codes prohibit chefs from selling the food that they 
prepare in their own home...Chefs must also have certification in safe food handling. Increased sophistication about food, spurred in part by star television cooks 
and celebrity restaurateurs, helped create this new niche in the food service industry, said Candy Wallace, executive director of the American Personal Chef 
Association, founded in San Diego in 1995. 'We also get a lot of clients with dietary restrictions and people watching their weight,' she said,' People can
 custom-tailor their food. You can't really do that in a restaurant, but if you hire a personal chef, you can sit there and watch while your meal is cooked if you want.'
 Ms. Wallace's organization counts 3,000 members, she said, 1,000 more than in 2001. The industry is also an outgrowth of the country's convenience culture.
 'Over the years, we started with a baby sitter in the house and we have a house cleaner,' said Nancy Rossnagel of Pleasantville...'Having a chef was the next logical
 step.'...Being a personal chef offers unrivaled flexibility...One pitfall in a profession with such obvious upside potential is frequent client turnover."<br>

"As lives get increasingly busy with careers, kids, commutes and other chaos, a growing number of people are turning to personal chefs to make sure that there's a 
hot meal on the table at the end of a long day. Hiring a professional to cook for you isn't a whole lot different from hiring someone to clean your house or walk the
 dog, and it's not just for the wealthy, said John Moore, executive director of the United States Personal Chef Association. "It's not 'Lifestyles of the Rich and 
Famous,'" Moore said. "People don't have personal chefs because they have tons of money, they have them because it solves a problem. It puts dinner on the table.
"Personal chefs typically prepare several days' worth of customized meals in advance, potentially for several clients. The meals are prepared and packaged, ready 
to be popped in an oven or microwave whenever a client wants to eat.Some chefs charge a flat rate; others are paid by the hour. The chef does the grocery 
shopping, along with the cleanup, and those costs are added to the bill.Total costs usually range between $15 and $20 per person per meal, depending on the kind 
of food prepared and other related costs. That's not much different from a meal at a restaurant, Moore said."Except that people don't have to go out, pay for 
parking or leave a tip," Moore said. "And they get to eat a meal that was custom made just for them."Personal chefs have the potential to make more money than 
their restaurant counterparts, about $25 per hour on average, compared with about $14.75 for a head cook or chef in a restaurant, Moore said.As a result, the 
personal chef industry has gained numerous "restaurant refugees," who see the profession as a way to both get away from hectic restaurant schedules and make 
more money, Moore said.The association estimates that there are just over 5,000 personal chef businesses operating in the U.S. and Canada, up from about 
1,500 a decade ago."<br>

"It takes a certain kind of personality to be a person's private chef. If that person is, say, R&B artist Keyshia Cole, then the daily menu might be low carbs, high 
protein and little feedback other than "that was good." If that person is a major league baseball pitcher, the Zone Diet might become a way of life, and the way you
 cook. Chef Barry Kraemer has that certain kind of personality, and he has cooked, professionally and personally, for Cole and the pitcher."When you're hired by a
 celebrity, or a family, to cook for them, you become a one-man show of housekeeper, dog walker, babysitter, chef, garbage man, grocer and go-to guy all in one,"
 says Kraemer of the 10- to 14-hour days he has worked making low-carb meals for Cole and others. (Cole was shooting a video during Kraemer's tenure.) His 
job, with the help of Cole's trainer, was to "transform her body and sculpt her like a body builder." Says Kraemer of his work: "It's challenging, and I love it. But if 
you're looking for the 'attaboys,' this job's not for you." The chef says it's rare if he actually has contact with the famous people he's cooked for, other than an 
occasional "hello." The former Arden's Garden sales rep started catering for a few of his clients several years back and finally made the switch to full-time private 
chef when he answered Cole's trainer's ad on Craigslist. Today he runs a personal chef and catering company, Sage Kitchen. "If I didn't love serving people and
 taking care of them, I could never succeed at this," Kraemer says. "Because a lot of times you don't get any feedback at all." He also must like long, arduous 
workdays, because most are spent shopping (often going to several stores to find that one particular requested item) and prepping for not just the day but the entire 
week --- only to have the whole menu changed at the last minute, or a party of two at 8 turning into a party of 12 at midnight. "I just keep the freezer and pantry 
stocked and anticipate all the changes," Kraemer says. "And the answer to everything is 'yes.' "Jobs may last from a couple of months to years. It can be lucrative, 
but often when the show is over, or that transfer to another team happens, Kraemer is left holding the kitchen tongs. Kraemer, who lives in Norcross, is self-taught, 
learning to cook from tasting and doing. He gives his clients an extensive questionnaire once he's hired so that he can assess exactly what they want. The 43 
questions cover everything from low-glycemic food preferences to dessert. The job requires an inordinate amount of organization, and Kraemer says that the 
kitchen must always look like "you're on TV" because guests --- from television executives to personal friends --- could drop in at any time."These are people who
 are used to being cared for," Kraemer says. "They have unpredictable schedules. It's a little like a cooking contest I have with myself every day.""<br>

 "86, and bartenders' number code. 
 Practicing barkeeps of the nation aren't going to like this explanation, but indications are that 86
 may well have come from a number code created by the comparatively effete soda fountain
 clerks of the nation...Originally, according the the American Thesaurus of Slang, it was a
 password used between clerks to to indicate: "We're all out of the item ordered." The transition
 from this meaning--common enough in soda fountains of the 1920's--to the bartender's sense of
 "Serve no more because of the shape he's in" is fairly obvious. The number code developed by
 the soda clerks was very extensive, incidentally. The head  fountain manager was 99, the
 assistant manager was 98--which also meant "pest"...and for some reason, 33 meant a cherry-flavored Coca-Cola, 55 meant

 who derived the expression from the California beverage code--Section 86--which prohibits
 serving alcoholic beverages to persons in an intoxicated states. At. P.J. Clarke's on Fifty-fifth
 Street in New York City, the explanation is this: "In the early days of this country, when much of
 the distilled liquor was served 100 proof, a bartender would cut off an offensive or intoxicated
 customer by  \86ing him.' That is, by cutting the proof of the liquor to 86."

"“86” (not from Chumley’s or Empire State Building) 
"Eighty six," in restaurant lingo, means to be out of an item. It is sometimes claimed that it comes from Chumley's, at 86 Bedford Street, or that it comes from the Empire State Building, where an elevator takes you to the 86th floor.

I found the earliest citation so far -- in a Walter Winchell column from 1933. Winchell, the great Broadway slang man, records this bit of slang from Hollywood. This 1933 date and the fact that Winchell does not claim any New York connection rules out both Chumley's and the Empire State Building theories; both Chumley's (1927) and the Empire State Building (1931) were new. Slang for the Empire State Building would hardly be unknown.

Other New York theories for "eighty six" seem equally dubious, and it is unlikely that Walter Winchell would not record them, had they existed."<br>

<b>Men & women dining together in restaurants</b><br>

When did men and women begin dining in public together? Excellent question! We examined three cities: Paris, London and New York. While evidence suggests some mixed dining happened as early as the 18th century, this practice was not fashionable until the late 19th/early 20th century. The primary drivers were rise of the middle class (economic), growth of the hotel industry (restaurants catered to traveling couples), and demise of restrictive Victorian culture (social). 
Did you know? Long before it was fashionable for men and women to be seen dining in public together, they dined "out" in private rooms. Fine restaurants and hotels established separate dining rooms for ladies. Tea rooms, ice cream parlors and department store restaurants catered exclusively to female clientele. 
<p>
<b>PARIS </b><br>
"After the 1760s, restaurateurs no longer advertised special 'apartments' for ladies alone, but they were quick to offer private rooms 
for intimate meals." <br>
---<i>The Invention of the Restaurant</i>, Rebecca Spang [Harvard University Press:Cambridge MA] 2000 (p. 80)
<p> 
"By 1788, one description of the restaurants of the Palais Royal commented, 'Honest women, 
and those of good reputation, never go there'--but an 1803 guidebook instructed its readers: 'one may not lunch with a lady in 
a cafe, but one may have dinner with her in a restaurant.' Who was that woman in the restaurant, and how could one know 
for sure? Whoever the women were, their presence immediately separated a restaurant from a table d'hote or a cafe." <br>
---<i>ibid</i> (p. 83) 
<p>
"...women had never been absent from restaurant dining rooms in Paris. Charlotte Bronson of Boston, on her Paris honeymoon [1830s], 
wrote copious letters to her parents and siblings in which she noted the site of every evening's meal and repeatedly assured her 
correspondents that eating in restaurants was 'quite the common thing for ladies' and 'very fashionable' among them. When she dines 
at the Cafe de Paris, there were 'many ladies'..." <br>
---(p. 199) 
<p>
"Martha Amory, a honeymooning American of the 1820s, dined with her new spouse in one of the intimate private rooms of the Trois 
Freres Provencaux, but she did not find it a very 'novel' experience..." <br>
---(p. 209) 
<p>
<b>London</b><br>
"Those restaurants account for the very slow breakdown in the extreme formality of the Victorian restaurant, which began 
with the 
introduction of the grill room in hotels towards the end of the [19th] century...In the grill room the fare would be simpler, but it would be served primarily to a male gathering. Ladies would usually eat with 
their families in their hotel rooms. It was the Ritz at the Savoy who started the movement towards eating out in mixed 
mixed company, though only with suitable safeguards. Ladies had to wear hats and were to be accompanied. The regulations which had to 
be obeyed before you could spend our money in a top class restaurant appear in retrospect a trifle ludicrous unless you remember 
how important it was to protect the restaurant's reputation." <br>

<p>
"One of the big shifts in eating out during the last 500 years is the full accommodation of women from the late 19th century 
onwards, mirroring the march of women into the work force and public life. Later in the 20th century children also began to be 
accommodated, as the novel idea that families could eat out together for fun began to take hold." <br>

<p>
"Much to the surprise of foreigners, [17th century] taverns were also frequented by women...Women could and did dine in taverns 
without compromising their honour, and Mrs Pepys regularly met her husband and their friends for a meal at a favorite 
haunt." <br>
---ibid (p. 35-36) 
<p>
"At the end of the [18th] century, John Britton records occasionally meeting women at the modest eating-house in Holborn where he dined. Earlier 
Dr. Johnson and the Ivy-Lane Club had entertained Charlotte Lennox, her husband and a woman friend to a bohemian supper at the Devil 
Tavern in Fleet Street; the party went on all night and was probably an exceptional occasion. The social life of genteel women was focused in the 
home with occasional visits to assembly rooms and routs, while men pursued their friendships and interests outside in coffee-houses, 
taverns and chop houses. In the summer, however, women were able to enjoy eating out at London's many tea and pleasure 
gardens." <br>
---ibid (p. 63)
<p> 
"A significant development of the 19th century was the arrival of the restaurant and modern hotel, which both provided acceptable 
public surroundings for mixed dining. In 1851 the influx of visitors to London to see the Great Exhibition focused attention on the shortage 
of suitable venues for men and women eating together. Women could eat alone at confectioner's shops, ad they had done since the 
beginning of the century, and in 'Parisian cafes' at the fashionable Thames-side resorts such as Windsor, Richmond and 
Greenwich...More conventional or less confident women could eat in the separate ladies' dining rooms provided by some 
establishments. At the end of the century the cafes and refreshment rooms introduced in shops and department stores...offered 
another alternative for women up in town. However, for families or mixed parties there were few places where a meal could 
be eaten...Increasing middle-class demands for respectable eating places, suitable for members of both sexes, undoubtedly 
encouraged the growth of restaurants." <br>
---ibid (p. 79-80) 
<p>
"In 1868 Frederick Gordon, a leading entrepreneur, leased Crosby Hall, a 15th century building in Bishopsgate, to convert it into 
a restaurant. The dining room was open to men and women, and waitresses, not waiters, attended the tables. The provision of a 
ladies 'boudoir' and retiring rooms with female attendants shows that Gordon was actively seeking women customers." <br>
---ibid (p. 81) 
<p>
"Escoffier made no secret of the fact that he enjoyed cooking for women, so Ritz set out to alter the custom of centuries. Not only 
did he succeed in an astonishing short space of time, he also managed to change British law. With the help of allies and 
society leaders such as Lady de Grey and Mrs Keppel, it became fashionable for women to frequent the Savoy and subsequently 
other top class hotels and restaurants. When the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, dined at the Savoy with Mrs. Langtry it was the 
ultimate recommendation." <br>

<b>New York City</b><br>
"The Manhattan business lunch disrupted the domestic circle. No longer was it possible for families to gather at home for a leisurely 
midday meal. For older New Yorkers, this break in tradition marked the beginning of the modern era. It was yet another reminder 
that the city was now a money-driven powerhouse where the gentler manners of the Knickerbocker era no longer applied and 
women could take their meals outside the house. The propulsive energies carrying New York into the future conspired against 
private life, and private dining. 'As the fathers, brothers, and sons do not go home to dinner, the mothers, wives and 
daughters have no inducements to eat their meals in solitude,' Putnam's observed in 1853. 'So while the male members of the family 
are eating their little dinners at Delmonico's, Frederick's, or Sweeny's, as the case may be, the female members are solacing 
themselves with fricandeaus, meringues, and ices at Thompson's, Taylor's, or Weller's; so that it may be said that nearly 
half of the people of New-York dine out every day in the week but Sunday. Where women fit in remains a puzzling question. To a 
great extent, public dining was segregated by sex, either explicitly or implicitly. Unescorted women were not admitted to most hotel 
dining rooms and fine restaurants, and, by preference,they did not venture into masculine haunts like the downtown lunch rooms and 
oyster saloons. Yet not all doors were closed. Charles Richard Weld, an Englishman, paid a visit to the same Taylor's mentioned 
by Putnams and, with some surprise, noted the presence of female parties at several tables. For the benefit of his English 
readers, he added that 'this in not at all uncommon in New York.' In fact, at the Brevoort House he witnessed the very same 
phenomenon: a part of women who sat down, ordered, ate...and departed...The evidence is scant and contradictory. Did the 
gender policy depend on the type of restaurant, the management, or the neighborhood? It is difficult to say." <br>
---<i>Appetite City: A Culinary History of New York</i>, William Grimes [North Point Press:New York] 2009 (p. 63-64) 
<p>
"Profound cultural change was sweeping over America. Women, increasingly part of the labor force in large cities, were slowly 
asserting their rights, and the pressures of a modern economy were breaking down old barriers segregating the sexes. These were 
formidable...With the new century moving briskly along, women still could not go into a bar...If they entered a restaurant without 
a male escort, they were directed to the ladies' cafe, if one existed, or to a lunchroom specifically designated for women. All 
this was about to change. When the Cafe Martin announced that women would be allowed to eat in the main dining room, it read the 
future correctly. The old rules were up for revision." <br>

electrical device which projects them as moving letters on a screen. The system is designed for transmitting from a central depot or studio brief news reports, sports
 items and other such material for display on a number of 'receivers' simultaneously. Mr. Peck, who heads Peck Television Corporation of 66 Broadway, has been 
perfecting the mechanism for at least two years. He said arrangements are under way to install receiving equipment in more than 200 restaurants and other
 semipublic places in the city in the near future. Mr. Dempsy sent the first message over the system, lauding the idea as one which will not conflict with other

"...the Sumerians...had a written language. Thanks to them, we have the first written dinner menus. A clay tablet B.C. lists a
proper meal for the gods. No doubt this was a kind of kitchen memorandum for the benefit of priests in training. The gods, according
to this listing, might be served chickens, ducks, or doves; they were partial to the meat of sheep and goats and that of
cows, and they also enjoyed fish. For dressing these deified entrees either olive oil or sesame oil might be used. For garniture
dates, givs, and cucumbers were acceptable, as were pistachio nuts, apricots, prunes, and dried raisins. A god might also have
a sweet tooth, for the memorandum ends with a reference to cakes. He sometimes drank a wine made from sesame seeds. Since
a Sumerian king was considered a living deity, we can assume that these celestial meals were actually served to the
king himself who consumed the food as a deputy of the gods."<br>

"From the early 1770s, at the latest, the use in restaurants of a printed menu, or carte, that
allowed each customer to choose his or her own restoratives marked another distinctive
innovation in service. Before the emergence of the restaurant, a menu had always been a list of all
those foods to be served during a particular meal (as at a banquet today). Cookbooks
recommended them and chefs in wealthy households composed them, but all the items on the
menu were brought to the table in the course of the meal. A table d'hote had no menu; the eaters
(whoever in the course of the meal might be) and the food (whatever it might be) arrived at the
same moment. The restaurant's role as a place for the exhibition and treatment of individual
weaknesses, however, necessitated a new sense of the menu: the creation of a list of available
items from which each consumer made personal choices at the most convenient moment. In the
restaurant, the vagaries of each customer-patient's malady demanded different dietary treatments;
no two souls or nervous systems were "sensitive" in the same way. When ordering from a
restaurant menu, the patron therefore made a highly individualistic statement, differentiating
him-or herself (and his or her bodily complaint) from the other eaters and their conditions. By the
mere
presence of a menu, the restaurant's style of service demanded a degree of self-definition, and
awareness and cultivation of personal tastes, uncalled for by the inn or cookshop...Restaurants
had printed menus because they offered their customers a choice of unseen dishes...While a
restaurant's fare might not be uniform...its monetary transactions were...the printed menu allowed
restaurant patrons to calculate costs "before spending a penny." There in print, set and fixed
before his or her very eyes, the restaurant customer saw prices and dish names, concoctions and
costs. No longer required to share each of the dishes brought to a table d'hote, but permitted to
concentrate on the ones he or she explicitly requested, the restaurant patrons could make
preference as much a matter of finance as of taste...In a restaurant, the ostentations potlatch of
baroque expenditure was replaced by the equally conspicuous and significant economy of
rationalized calculation."<br>

<b>Looking for information on the origins and evolution of classic French menus?</b><br>
We are often asked to provide the sequence of items comprising the "Classic 12 course French menu." The classic French style of menu 
making and courses is complicated. The number of courses, and the number of dishes served at each course, are period and 
meal dependant. Our research confirms "classic" meals generally offer 4 to 8 courses. Examples of 
<a href="restaurants.html#12course">12 course menus</a> are
rare, perhaps suggesting they are not "standard" at all. Note: number of <a href="restaurants.html#covers">covers</a> does not mean number of courses.
<p>
"Composition of the Classic Meal...formal meals consisted of several 'courses'--usually there or four but at times five or more--each composed of several dishes brought
 to 
the table at the same time. Here is how A.-B.-L. Grimod de La Reyniere describes such a meal in his 1805 <i>Almanach des gourmands</i>: 'An important dinner normally 
comprises four courses. The first consists of soups, hors d'oeuvres, releves, and entrees; the second, of roasts and salads; the third of cold pasties and various 
entremets; and lastly, the fourth, of desserts including fresh and stewed fruit, cookies, macaroons, cheeses, all sorts of sweetmeats, and petits fours typically presented 
as part of a meal, as well as preserves and ices.' In describing the different courses, Grimod de la Reyniere puts different types of dishes in the same category. Some are
 defined by aspect and mode of preparation...Others are defined by their position and function in the sequence..."<br>
---<i>Arranging the Meal: A History of Table Service in
 France</i>, Jean-Louis Flandrin, translated by Julie E. Johnson [University of California Press:Berkeley] 2007(p. 3-4) 
<p>
"Many nineteenth-century authors suggested or justified a reduction in the number of courses and dishes. We have seen that between the sixteenth century and the 
seventeenth, fewer course came to be served at aristocratic tables. But their number was far from fixed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Important dinner...
usually had five courses--soups, entrees, roasts, entremets, and dessert...Menon's Cuisiniere bougreoise, published in 1746, offers one three course menu and two 
four-course menus, which also differ in how the courses are distributed."<br>
---<i>Arranging the Meal</i>  (p. 95)
<p>
<b>Details on the courses served in Grimod's period</b><br>
"A contemporary grand dinner was composed of four services: the first was made up of soups, hors d'oeuvres, releves and 
entrees. There might also be a visit from some savoury flying saucer or assiette volante, i.e. things that must be eaten as soon as
they are taken off the spit, out of the oven or off the hob; Grimod gives these examples: 'minute' cutlets, steaks, chicken 
croquettes, ortolans and other little birds on skewers, little pates, cheese ramequins or any form of souffle. The second service
 comprised of roasts and salads, with the obligatory groses pieces decorating the ends of the table. In general, these remained
 untouched, for they were more to please the eye than the appetite and could be anything from a vast mille-feuille to a Nerac
terrine, a heap of crayfish or a blue carp. The third service involved cold pates and entremets, either sweet or savory...
The final service was our modern dessert, with fruits, compotes, jams, biscuits, macaroons, cheeses, petits fours and sweets
as well as ices. At a large, formal dinner, the first service could contain anything up to a hundred dishes. In general, a
colour, either white or brown, predominated...This colour consideration became universal in nineteenth-century cooking."<br>

"The order of the dinner service is soup, fish, flesh, fowl. These may be supplemented to any extent with entrements and entrees. 
Mets are the principal dishes. Entremnents, the dishes served between the mets. Entrees, dishes which are served between 
any of the courses.<br>
<b>First Course:</b> Canapes of caviare, with small bits of anchovy toast, or in their season muskmelons, are sometimes served as the
first course, but ordinarily oysters or clams on the half shell is the first dish presented. The smallest-sized shell-fish are preferable to the large ones. One half 
dozen are served on each plate and placed symmetrically on or around a bed of cracked ice; a quarter of a lemon cut lengthwise is placed
in the center. Cayenne pepper and grated horse-radish are passed with this sauce, also very thin slices of brown bread buttered and
folded together, then cut into small squares or triangular-shaped pieces. The plates holding the shell-fish may be placed on the 
table before dinner is announced; but as there is no place to conveniently lay the folded napkin except on the plate, it is as well not
to serve the mollusks until the guests are seated.<br>
<b>Second Course: Soup</b> It is better to serve a clear soup when the dinner is to be of many courses, as heavy soups are too
hearty. The choice of two kinds of soup may be offered. Grated Parmesan cheese may be passed with clear soups, dice of fried
bread with cream soups, and toasted cracker biscuits with any kind of soup. One ladleful of soup is sufficient for each
person, and a second portion is not offered. An anecdote is told of a punctilious person who, being asked if he would be helped
again to soup, answered 'Thanks, not to-day.' Hors d'oeuvres, which are radishes, celery, olives, etc., are passed after the
soup. Salted almonds are taken at an time through the dinner.<br>
<b>Third Course: Fish</b> Fish, if boiled of fried, is served upon a napkin. If baked no napkin is used, and a little sauce is spread on the
dish. Boiled potatoes are served with boiled fish, and are more attractive when cut with a potato-scoop into small balls. 
Cucumbers dressed with oil and vinegar are also served with fish.<br>
<b>Fourth Course: Entrees</b> Entrees can be served between any of the courses, or they may be omitted altogether; but a variety of 
attractive dishes come under this head, and usually one is served after the fish.<br>
<b>Fifth Course: Vegetables</b> A vegetable, such as asparagus, artichokes, cauliflower, is served at this time, although the French reserve
the vegetable until after the joint. Only one vegetable besides potato is permitted with a meat course, and if more are wanted they are served as a 
separate course.<br>
<b>Sixth Course</b> The joint with one green vegetable and potato.<br>
<b>Seventh Course</b> Frozen punch, when served, comes between the meat and game courses. It is not passed, but a glassful standing on a
plate, with a coffee spoon beside it, is placed before each person. If preferred, a cheese omelet or souffle may be used instead of punch for
this course.<br>
<b>Eighth Course: Game or Salad, or Poultry and Salad</b> Game is usually not passed, but the portions are laid on the individual
plates by the butler. This is done in order to serve it as hot as possible. A small cold plate is simetiems given for the salad; crescent-shaped
plates are made for this use. With ducks, celery and small squares of fried hominy are served. When game or poutry is not used, cheese may
be served with the salad, or cheese-straws instead of cheese. When salad is served with game or poultry, cheese and crackers may be
served immediately afterward as a separate course, or they may be passed after the dessert.<br>
<b>Ninth Course</b> Sweet puddings, souffles, Bavarian cream, etc.<br>
<b>Tenth Course</b> Ice-cream or any frozen dessert. Cakes and brandied peaches, preserved ginger, or wine-jellies may be passed with
ice-cream.<br>
<b>Eleventh Course</b> Fruit, fresh or glace, and bonbons.<br>
<b>Twelfth Course</b> Coffee, liqueurs. <br>
Of the courses given above, the first, fourth, fifth, and seventh, and a choice of either the ninth or tenth, may all, or any one of them,
be omitted. Black coffee in small cups is passed on a tray, with cream and sugar, in the drawing- and smoking-rooms after the guests
have left the table. Appolinaris or other sparkling water is passed later, and is usually welcomed."<br>

<b>Releves & removes</b><br>
"Releve," is a French term which means "remove." In Classical French menus it can 
mean something similar to a "course." Typically it is served after the soup and before the entree. It is generally a substantial dish very similar to the entree. Today's diners are confused because we generally expect simpler menu constructions. It makes no sense to serve two "main" courses. 
Wealthy 17th-19th century diners (French, English) were used to meals composed of several courses. Classic menu presentation was an edible sign of power. NOTE: We have no clue if people actually ate more food back on those days. A multiplicity of dishes does not mean everyone scarfed everything like a cheap buffet. We do know they probably spent more time at the table based on the amount of time it took to set up, serve, remove numerous courses required by grand meals. 
<p>
<b>Definitions & notes: </b><br>
"Remove.--Dish which in French service relieves (in the sense that one sentry relieves another) the soup or the fish. This 
course precedes those called entrees." <br>
---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i> [Crown Publishers:New York] 1961 (p. 805) 
<p>
"Remove. In the days when food was served in the grand manner, this was a dish which 
'came to remove' (in other words, followed) another, usually the soup. Grimod de La 
Reyniere distinguishes between ordinary entrees and grosses' (large) entrees. The latter 
came to be called releves, he says, because when they arrived, the soup was removed, 
being at each end of the table'. As examples, he gives stuffed top loin of veal with cream, 
calf's head a la financiere, and a large freshwater fish, served with sauce and garnish. 
This was the order of a classic menu: hors d'oeuvre; soups; releves of the soups; fish 
(providing that fish was not one of the releve dishes); releves of fish (later eliminated); 
roasts, sometimes followed by releves of roasts; and finally desserts." <br>
---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, Completely updated and revised [Clarkson Potter:New York] 
2001 (p. 977) 
<p>
"The verb relever was already used in the seventeenth century to mean 'to clear away one dish and replace it immediately with another.' 
Nut the noun releve ['remove' in English culinary terminology] does not appear to have entered the vocabulary of the table until the 
eighteenth century. It is often used to designate the large spit-roasted entrees de broche that replaced the soups--usually during the 
first course, although they sometimes introduced the second...These releves could also be all kinds of dishes other than 
roasted meats...Prior to the nineteenth century, there were always as many releves as soups, but this later changed. We have already seen that 
releves appeared in menus at various points that did not always match their order of consumption. In the royal menu of 21 June 1751, the 
four releves were noted after the sixteen entrees and may have introduced the second course; similarly, in <i>Les Soupers de la Cour</i>, 
the 'Soup releves' constituted a 'second course' each time they were mentioned. But they could also appear elsewhere in the menu: 
about the same period, in the support for ten place settings from <i>la Cuisiniere bourgeoise</i>, the spit-roasted joint of butcher's meat 
listed as a releve for the soup occurs immediately after the soup it replaces." <br>
---<i>Arranging the meal: A History of Table Service in France</i>, Jean-Louis Flandrin, translated by Julie E. Johnson with Sylvie and Antonio 
Roder [University of California Press:Berkeley CA] 2007 (p. 76-77) 
<p>
"Formal dinners in the old style, a la francaise, had evolved from earlier medieval and Renaissance models, and a 'set' system in the course 
of the eighteenth century...Among the sides on the table were tureens of containing two or more varieties of soup. These would be served first, then the tureens 
and the soup plates were removed and the former replaced by dishes called releves, 'removes' in English--perhaps roast mutton and 
turkey en daube, or two large fishes. The guests could also begin eating the entrees, the 'entries' to the meal proper, which might include 
cheek of veal, cutlets, tongue, vol-au-vent, sole, chicken, sweetbreads, and eels. Two large entremets completed the picture: say, 
a cake and a fish. Around the large creations clustered little dishes, the hors d'oeuvres, placed literally 'outside' the main 'works.': 
hors d'oeuvres stood spatially apart, not temporally first as they do today. They were what me might call 'side dishes' and consisted of 
things as small pies, anchovies, tuna in marinade, oysters, eggs, artichokes, and radishes. They sometimes remained in place during the first and 
second courses, while the larger dishes were changed. The second course began after all or most of the dishes of the first 
course had been removed from the table...This consisted of the really big pieces...accompaniments to these are dishes were salads, vegetables, 
and sweet entremets: creams, jellies, ices; to our way of thinking, the second course was like a second complete meal. The last 
course, dessert, was cheeses, sweets, pastries, and fruit--but might include meat pates as well." <br>

1991 (p. 198-199)
<p>
In Classical French cooking "releve" is also applied to large cuts of meat. Chapters 7-9 
of Escoffier's <i>Guide Culinaire</i> [1903] is devoted to recipes for meat releves, including 
butcher's meat (includes lamb), poultry, and game. This book also provides extensive 
notes on proper accompaniments for each type of meat. Ask your librarian to help you

<b>How was the term "menu" derived ?</b><br>
Word derivations/origins/first use can be found in large, unabridged dictionaries. The <i>Larousse
de la
Langue Francaise</i> [Librarie Larousse:Paris] 1979 (p. 1140) confirms the word "menu" has
Latin roots.
The term has been used in the French language since the 1080. The word "menu" as it relates to
food
dates in French print to 1718. The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> (2nd edition) confirms the
English word
"menu" was borrowed from the French. The French borrowed it from the Latin word "minutus,"
meaning
detailed list. According to the <i>OED</i>, the first instance of the word "menu," as it relates to food, in
English
dates to 1837. There are other meanings of this word which pre- and post-date the food
relationship.

<b>When were children's menus introduced?</b><br>
The earliest references we find in print to children's menus in America (developed specifically for children, not a separate list of 
choices printed on the adult menu) surface in the early 20th century. The development was a perfect convergence of period 
scientific, social, and economic trends: <ol>
<li> Domestic scientists promoted the new discovery that 
healthy, growing children required special nutrition and foods. They were not just tiny adults, as previously thought.
<li> It was acceptable for modern women to dine in public during without male accompaniment during the day.
<li> Savvy marketers capitalized on a brand new market: selling to parents via their children. 
</ol>
Childern's menus were were offered by department stores,
fancy hotels, railroads, and catering companies. Colorfully decorated menus featuring games and nursery rhymes where developed by companies 
hoping to upsell wealthy people with small children. By WWI, <a href="restaurants.html#playspace">indoor playspaces</a> & 
<a href="restaurants.html#smokefree">tea rooms</a> 
encouraged modern upscale homemakers (or their nannies) to bring their children to department stores while they shopped and socialized.
<p>
"When children rode the train, special efforts were made to add to their dining pleasure. It might begin with the steward, cookie
jar in hand, passing through the train handing out complimentary between-meal snacks. When he seated children in the dining car, 
he might hand each one a peppermint stick. The colorful children's menu, sometimes with a happy story or interesting facts included, 
often named the meal as to enhance the fantasy children experience when traveling by train. So chicken soup, a broiled lamb
chop, mashed potatoes, carrot sticks and ice cream became the "Engineer's Special Dinner." Children's mealtime favorites included
spaghetti, a broiled hamburger with French Fried potatoes, and French toast...Every effort was made to ensure that all children
ate and enjoyed their meals, and that memories of the experience lingered with them. They were, after all, the next generation
of riders."<br>

""A special bill-of-fare for children is now a feature in the dining cars of the Canadian National Railways. The items have been
selected after consultation with a well-known dietitian and the menu is presented as a suitable guide for use with children of all
ages up to ten. Parents traveling often feed their children food bought prior to the journey, rather than make use of the dining 
car service, because of a feeling that it would be a difficult task to choose from the regular menu. The children's menu, for each
meal, breakfast, dinner and tea contains four combinations of fare; breakfast ranging in price from 40 cents to 60 cents, dinner form 
50 to 85 cents and tea from 35 to 65 cents. As the dining car steward passes through the cars, announcing the calls for meals, he 
gives one of these special bills to each passenger traveling with a child. In addition to the menu proper, there are pictures printed in

<center><font size="5" color="#003366"><b>Modern table service</b> [French, Russian, English & American]</font></center><p>
In all societies and times, grand meals composed of several courses require a plan for serving. Modern European table service
traditions center on four distinct, yet related, styles of service: <a href="restaurants.html#frenchservice">French</a>, <a href="restaurants.html#russianservice">
Russian</a>, <a href="restaurants.html#englishservice">English</a> & <a href="restaurants.html#americanservice">American</a>. In Western cultures, 
<a href="restaurants.html#butlerservice">Butler service</a> also figured in. 
<p>
<b>The evolution of modern table service</b><br>
The evolution of classic European table service was slow and complicated, especially in England. There, you have not only service a la Francaise but service
 l'Anglaise competing with Service a la Russe. Food historians generally place the beginning of the evolution in dawning decades of the 19th century. The switch is
 in serious motion by mid-century. By the 1880s-1890s, Service a la Russe reigned supreme.
<p>
"By the close of the eighteenth century the traditional service of meals in the French manner, as it had evolved from the baroque age,
was already under strain. It had begun reasonably enough. A set of dishes was placed on the table from which people either helped 
themselves or were assisted by the servants. Everything was arranged in perfect symmetry, and when one course ended the dishes
were cleared and replaced by the next, equally symmetrical course. The rule that dishes were multiplied in dozens according to the
number of guests meant that a table could end up with as many as hundred dishes on it at a time...By 1800...the range of containers
and other tableware had increased hugely...The consequence was that a vast amount of food went uneaten and...it was inevitably
cold or, at best, lukewarm...in 1838...[in England we find]...a version of the French system known as service a l'anglaise
...This sort of...[service] would have already been regarded as old-fashioned among the upper classes, who were eagerly adopting
changes which had their origins in France...In June 1810...the Russian diplomat Prince Borisovitch Kourakine served his guests in an 
entirely novel manner [service a la Russe]...That new service, with the opportunities it presented for the ostentatious display,
began to gain acceptance and can be seen from the fact sourtouts a la russe in 1810. Careme...did not favour service a la russe and
the traditional method of a la francaise lingered on until the 1850s...In France it was to take until the last decade of the nineteenth
century for service a la russe to become the norm. Even then for state dinners and great occasions service a la francaise was retained
for its spectacular effect...Only when service a la russe was finally universal could Escoffier establish the sequence of 
courses that remains familiar to this day: hors d'oeuvre or soup, fish, meat with vegetables, sweet, savoury and dessert. In
England the move to the new method of service was equally slow. Service a la francaise continued into the 1870s and 1880s, with the 
usual two great courses followed by dessert. The vast majority of Mrs. Beeton's 'Bills of fare' are intended for this system, but she
also takes note of the new one...The effect of a la russe, apart from the hot food, was to multiply the course, but the result
was a welcome contraction of the time spent at table. Under the old system a meal could last for hours. A dinner a la russe lasted
an hour and a half at the most...[Service a la Russe] triumph is...connected with the emergence of an extremely rich new
middle class. The opportunity for lavish display and the need for a small army of servants effectively marked service a la russe
as the choice only for those who could afford it..."<br>
---<i>Feast: A History of Grand Eating</i>, Roy Strong [Harcourt:New York] 2002 (p. 294-299) 
<p>
"Felix Urbaine Dubois, sometime chef for the King of Prussia...is credited with doing something for the cause of hot food by being the
prime mover in the displacement of service a la francaise by service a la russe. The former phrase means the method, dating
from the Middle Ages...Service a la russe made its appearance in France and England around mid-century, but was not universally
adopted until the 1890s."<br>

<p>
"The nineteenth-century displacement of "French service" by "Russian service" is reputed to be a major event in the history of
table serve. Yet the period when this transition occurred is difficult to pinpoint. It is not even certain that this tableservice
innovation changed anything regarding the order in which dishes were presented. The order of presentation, however, did not remain
static throughout the nineteenth century. All sorts of minor changes were taking place, some perhaps resulting from the new 
serving customs. In their 1856 Cuisine classique, Dubois and Bernard wrote, 'Table service today is generally based on two methods, '
French service and Russian service, which where a common goal but start from conflicting if not opposite principles. each method has
its proponents and opponents, converts and critics, but both are practiced equally. Cooks to the Prussian King and advocates of the
Russian style...predominated at prestigious French and English tables...This Russian service, which apparently came to prevail in 
France only during the second half of the nineteenth century, was already being discussed fifty years earlier. In the 1804 Almanach
des gourmandes, [by] Grimod de La Reyniere..."<br>

<b>Mrs. Beeton's observations regarding Service a la russe [1861]</b><br>
"Note.—Dinners à la Russe differ from ordinary dinners in the mode of serving the various dishes. In a dinner à la Russe, the dishes are cut up on a sideboard, and 
handed round to the guests, and each dish may be considered a course. The table for a dinner à la Russe should be laid with flowers and plants in fancy flowerpots 
down the middle, together with some of the dessert dishes. A menu or bill of fare should be laid by the side of each guest. Note.—Dinners à la Russe are scarcely 
suitable for small establishments; a large number of servants being required to carve; and to help the guests; besides there being a necessity for more plates, dishes,
knives, forks, and spoons, than are usually to be found in any other than a very large establishment. Where, however, a service à la Russe is practicable, there it, 
perhaps, no mode of serving a dinner so enjoyable as this."<br>

<b>Ancient Roman dining service</b><br>
<i>Around the Roman Table</i>/Patrick Faas describes four styles of ancient Roman dining service. None specifically mention where the tables were placed in the dining area. 
"1. The buffet: tables and respositoria, containing beautifully displayed dishes, brought in by servants. Reclining guests helped themselves from such exhibits, without much further assistance...2. Roasts brought in whole and carved in the dining room. The pieces were elegantly displayed on a the central tables, from which the guests helped themselves...3. Plate service: each guest was given an individual plate with a set portion, as in modern restaurants...4....each guest [was given] their own table. This style was inherited from the Etruscans, and can be seen on ancient frescoes. It is much like traditional Japanese meals, except that Roman gentlemen would recline instead of kneel...This was also how the nobility ate solitary meals...5. The Athenian way of serving food was a cross between 1 and 4, but many little dishes, as in 4, on a central table." (p. 70-71) 

<p>
<a name="frenchservice">
<b>Service a la Francaise [FRENCH SERVICE]</b><p> 
"Based upon the banquet styles of the sixteenth century, service a la francaise is the most elaborate and labor intensive of all
serving styles. Traditionally, French service at small banquests in large private homes divided a meal into three separate
courses, with much of the food cooked or finished tableside, from a rolling cart or gueridon, in the dining room. (Tableside
cooking first began in Russia and was then further developed into a flourishing service style in France...)As guests entered
the dning room, the first course was already set up...Hot items were brought into the dining room on silver platters and paced on the
gueridon, or covered warmer. After the guests finished a service, they got up and left the table while it was cleaned and reset
for the next service. This second course was the releve or remove. The first two services of between ten and forty itmes, including
soups, game, and roasts. Many of hese items wer eplaced on the table on platters with serving utensils for what might be referred
to as family-style service today. A third service, the entremets, included a vareity of desserts, savories, puddings, fruits,
and nuts."<br>

<p>
"Formal dinners in the old style, a la francaise, had evolved from earlier medieval and Renaisance models, and 'set' as a system in the course of the eighteenth
century. Diners...would arrive at table to find it laden with food. Dishes, candles, salts, and ornaments had been placed with careful attention to the hierarchy of dishes
and the position they could therefore command upon the table, to symmetry (dishes for dinner a la francaise often came in pairs), and to the relative heights of fruit pyramids
and decorative objects. Order was especially important because of the crowding of the table: table-servants are warned to take care lest dishes 'look as if they had fallen down
like hailstones.' The whole was designed to give an impression of opulence and abundance. The guests at Baroque and Rococo dinners a la francaise sat much closer to each other than we do, round the edges of the huge table which was required
 for the laying out of all the dishes...They were expected to eat from the dishes placed in the immediate vicinity of their places. It was permissible to ask a servant to pass a 
helping of something placed some distance away, especially if the host had recommended it as he spoke is 'menu' at the beginning of the feast, but it was not done to ask too often. People were more
obliged than we are to notice what neighbours were missing and could not reach, or carve, or cut without their help."<br>

"Throughout the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, service a la francaise, or French-style service, remained de rigueur in elite American homes, and visitors' 
accounts suggest that dining at Jefferson's table was no exception. This mode of entertainment gained favor in France among medieval nobility and soon spread
throughout much of Europe. Although dining etiquette developled over the centuries, the tenets of service a la francaise remained largely unaltered and were
heralded in early America. Fashionable hosts strictly followed the style's edicts, which reflected hierarchy, balande, and symmetry so admired in the period. French-style
service commonly dictated two to four courses, each consisting a of an even number of dishes placed symmetrically around a centerpiece, such as a large roast or a 
decorative serving vessel. Dishes were divided into classes and hierarchally arranged, with those belonging to lesser classes surrounding those of greature stature. The
number of diners determined the quantity of dishes served. A three-course dinner for eight, for example, could require as many as twenty-four separate dishes. As the
number of guests increased, so did the variety of foods presented. Service a la francaise was more than simply a style of eating; it was a mode of entertainment--one that began
the moment guests entered the diningroom. There to greet them stood a table fully set with silver, glass, and great platters and tureens filled and at the ready, encouraging
the appetite and impressing the senses. Above all, service a la francaise emphasized an orderly and grand presentation of dishes that showcased a host's resources and
culinary savoir-faire. Evidence suggests that Jefferson regarded French-style service as at once the epitome of fashionable entertaining and a mere template. It guided
his decisions and influenced his taste, but, in the end, he used the principles of this revered serve to create a dining style that was uniquely his own. Jefferson combined
French-style elegance and cuisine with his own democratic sense of style, inspiring one guest to note, 'In his entertainmnets, republican simplicity was united to
Epicurean delicacy.'"<br>

"English and family servce conjures nostalgic images of families gathered around a steaming roast on Sunday afternoon...In
restaurants and country clubs, this style of servcie is usually reserved for private rooms or special group dinners, where
guests want to mimic a home-style setting while still being waited on. Plates are preset and the server moves clockwise around
the table when clearing used plates. As with Russian and butler service, all food is fully cooked in the kitchen. The host,
or perhaps the maitre d'hotel, carves the meat (or whatever the main dish happens to be), and passes it to the nearest diner who
in turn passes it along the table...The host generally serves soup into bowls, which are then passed around the table. Side 
dishes arrive from the kitchen in large serving platters and guests help themselves, or the host may plate the side dishes before
passing the plates. Alternatively, serving dishes can be placed on a sideboard, from which the server plates of all the food, 
and then presents it to the guests. Variations on this less formal style of serving are becoming popular in the United
States, especially new American restaurants and grills that want to create a more family-like ambience...Family style is similar

various other tureens. Here again, the servants assisted with the serving. Warm plates may have been brought in from the kitchen 
or fetched from a plate-warmer by the fire. The hot dishes can be seen to be standing on placemats to prevent scorching the table's

"A few French and Italian restaurants here follow the European custom of not serving water at the table when wine is ordered. Is that proper? Water

to drink. But French etiquette demands that water be served at formal diners. And American authorities on etiquette all include a glass of water
in table settings. Of course, doctors advise that water should be drunk between meals, not with food. But a sip of water in the midst of dinner
clears the palate and quenches the thirst, which wine does not do."<br>

<center><font size="5" color="#003366"><b>Why do American restaurants serve water with lemon/lime slices?</b></font></center>
<p>
Food historians confirm citrus (lemons, limes, oranges) have been paired with water (soda, mineral) in several chemical 
states (hot, warm, cold, ice) for thousands of years for various reasons (taste, flavor, color, medicinal). Think: hot 
tea with lemon, lemon-lime soda, <a href="foodbeverages.html#lemonade">lemonade</a>, & lemon ices. 
<p>
The current practice of adding lemons to ice in restaurants possibly descends from Temperance times. Fancy lemon cocktail
 garnishes might have been repurposed to non-alcoholic beverages. The earliest print reference we find for pairing lemon 
slices and water is from the early 20th century. Perrier promoted this combination for the temperance inclined.

<b>[1980s]</b><br>
By the early 1980s, the "gourmet" bottled water market was in full swing. Trendy restaurants proudly served 
personal-size French bottled water to guests. In 1983 we find a curious juxtopostion of articles addressing this
particular topic. One promotes lemons for bottled water; the other declares this practice an unforgivable gaffe. 
<p>
<b>[1983] </b><br>
"Good for more than just traditional uses, lemons lend themselves to a number of wholesome uses around the house, too. Here are 
some ideas: --Add a squeeze of lemon to colas, Diet cola, especially, tastes better. --Use a lemon wedge in chilled bottled

"Considering the status bottled waters now enjoy, we can probably expect that soon a new brand of connoisseurship will develop 
and vintage waters may not be far away. If the wines differ from year to year, why not the waters of a particular spring or 
well?...Should the waters of May cost more than those of December and is 1983 any better than 1982? And should all bottled waters 
be served in the same shaped glass?...All of this came to mind after reading a letter of complaint about waiters who serve 
bottled waters that have been opened before being brought to the table. Such a practice is unacceptable when wine is served, because 
there is always the chance that the wine being poured is not really the bottle's original contents. The label, therefore, ay not accurately 
describe what is being poured. It might be of humbler origins than the label indicates...Etiquette then dictates that wine should 
be opened in front of the customer. Why not water? It is perfectly possible for a domestic club soda to be poured into a bottle 
marked Perrier, or even for tap water to be used...Another annoying 
practice when serving bottled water is to add ice cubes to chill it...The custom of automatically adding lime or lemon to bottled 
water also seems to be a mistake., for if the clarity and purity of the water itself is to be appreciated, why add the sting of 
citrus unless it is requested? Even when customers ask to have bottled water plain, it often arrives with the lime already 
in it." <br>

Mr. Joseph Horn and Mr. Frank Hardart launched their restaurant empire in 1888 in a tiny 15
stool

lunchroom in central Philadelphia with $1,000 borrowed from a family member and a recipe for

coffee.  The restaurant was successful and before long the Horn and Hardart Baking Company

operated several lunchrooms throughout Philly. In 1900 Mr. Hardart traveled to Berlin and visited

the Quisiana Company Automat, a "waiterless restaurant." He was soon convinced the automat 

represented the food service wave of the future. It was simple, efficient and sanitary. Mr. Hardart

ordered automat machinery for his company. In 1902, the very first Horn & Hardart automat

opened at 1818 Chestnut St, Philadelphia. In 1912 the first H & H opened in New York City,

smack in the middle of Times Square. 
<p>
Automat technology was patented by inventor John Fritsche and assigned to Joseph Horn and Frank Hardart.

doors, etc. You can read the patents full text via <a href="http://foodtimeline.org/google.com/patents/">Google</a> (search the three last names listed above).

<p>
Inexpensive lunchrooms and <a href="restaurants.html#cafeterias">self-service cafeterias</a> were wildly popular in the dawning decades of the 20th century. 
They offered both full and self service. Automats introduced another layer of technology between the diner and the food.
Like today's self-service check-out systems, people had to be trained on the equipment before it caught on. 
<p>
<b>What did Americans think of German automats?</b><br>
"More economical yet is it to lunch at an 'automat.' Here you put your money, 10 pfennigs (2 1/2 cents), into a slot. For this sum you can get any 
number of kinds of wine--and all kinds very poor, I imagine--and a great many different things mounted on a half of a roll--slices of hard boiled
 eggs with onion, smoked salmon, sausage slices, queer salads--and some sweets. The food is on tiny boat dishes which set on porcelain paddles 
under great glass bells. All the handless paddles are fastened to a central axis and on the back in the front of the glass is the name of the 
thing--in both German and English--and beside this a slot for your money. you drop in your coin, the paddles commence to move, and when the
 first weighted one arrives at a box just outside and below the bank it includes, released its burden, and this comes down a little chute into the 
box. What you get to eat in these places may be very good for Germans, but it is likely to give other people of less sturdy digestion wheat used to
 be called 'heartburn." <br>
---"The World's Cooks: Unique German Restaurants," Jane Eddington, <i>Chicago Daily Tribune</i>, February 28, 1913 (p. 11)
<p>
<b>The American experience</b><br>
Our survey of historic newspapers sugggest automats were not immediately embraced by the American public. Articles confirm
the sharp rise in "cheap eating houses." We find no print evidence heralding the glories of the automat or praising its food
in the early decades. In the 1920s Horn & Hardart postitioned their new restaurants in upscale locations. Newspaper
ads announced grand openings. 
<p>
"Today--at 47-51 East 59th Street, between Park and Madison, surrounded by such modern Apartments as the new Sherry-Netherland and New
Savoy Plaza, and convienent to Bloomingdale Shoppers--a large, beautify new Horn & Hardart Automat-Cafeteria invites your 
inspection. How well New York's most modern form of Restaurant Service harmnizes weith this ultra-modern towering district!. A
Noted Author says: 'This is the Day of the Automat-Cafeteria. It is to Food what the Motor-Car is to Travel, what the Radio
is to Music. It is the most metropolitan. You see for yourself and serve yourself..' Your eyes range over socres of square feet of 
Cracked Ice with an array of hundreds of Salads and Cold Dishes. Beautiful Savory Roasts and delicious Dinner Dishes speak for themselves
on the Steam Table. IN the unique Automat Section, all kinds of Desserts, Cakes, and Rolls have their own little Show Windows. 
Display! That is the story--a great modern display of 'Excellent Foods' at 'Sensible Prices' that everyone can pay...36 Convenient Horn
& Hardart Automat-Cafeterias, Restaurants and Sandwich Shops, all supplied by the great Horn & Hardart Bakeries and Kitchens, and
serving 300,000 New Yorkers every day. The only System of its kind in New York and the only System by which uniformly
Excellnt Fod can be served simutalniously everywhere to everyone."<br>

<p>

Newspaper articles chronicle company growth, challenges and consumer trends. Slug (fake) nickels were a serious problem for 
a while. Horn and Hardart restaurants were popular during the Great Depression years and WWII
because they served inexpensive yet tasty selections. Customers could (and did) sit for hours over a cup of coffee
and piece of pie. Automats were respectable places for unemployed and other folks who had (literally) two nickels to rub
together. 
After the war automat dining began to fade. American demographics migrated to the suburbs. Family-friendly dining 
grew with the Boomer generation. By the 1960s, Horn & Hardarts company's committment to high quality food at low cost 
became an economic drain. 

<p>
The original Philadelphia H & H automat closed in 1968. Horn & Hardart filed for bankruptcy in 1971. The last automat (200 E 42nd St., NYC) closed

its doors April 10, 1991. A portion of Mr. Hardart's original imported automat machines from

Chestnut St. are currently housed in the National Museum of American History (Palm Court), Washington DC.

<a name="automatfood">
<b>What about the food?</b><br>
Meals were planned by award-winning chefs

and recipes were stored in a safe. Quality control was tantamount to the operation. Every day the

founders and top executives met at what they called the "Sample Table," to ensure their 
<a href="restaurants.html#automatrecipes">recipes</a>

were followed to their satisfaction. Consider this review:<blockquote>
"Nickels in slots at Horn & Hardart Automats, which once upon a time yielded only buns, bean
pots, fish cakes, coffee, and such, can nowadays be played cafeteria-wise. Handful of nickels will
load your tray with quite a meal, hot and well prepared. Of the 40 automats, I think you'd
particularly like the ones at 545 Fifth Avenue (corner of 45th), and 106 West 50th (new
Rockefeller Center), and 104 West 57th."<br>

<a name="automatrecipes">
<b>How do I find authentic Horn & Hardart recipes?</b><br>
Evidence suggests that the original recipes used by H & H were closely guarded secrets:<p>
"In the heyday of Automats, recipes were stowed in a safe, and they told not only how to make
the food but where to position it on the plate."<br>---Last Automat shuts its many little doors
forever," <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, April 12, 1991 (p.2). <p>This might explain why there are
only a few H & H attributed recipes printed in books and circulating on the Internet. Are they
authentic? Maybe. We are still researching the topic. According to an article printed in the
<i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> [August 8, 1994, section D, p. 1: Horn & Hardart foods are back], 
"Entrepreneurs Aaron J. Katz and Albert A. Mazzone have recreated recipes from the old Horn &
Hardart restaurants..." This article does not indicate whether these recreations were made from
original recipes or the product of a good chef's professional approximation. Here are the recipes
commonly attributed to Horn & Hardart:
<blockquote>
<ul>

Melt the butter, blend in the flour and slowly add the milk, stirring constatnly, preferable with a wire whisk. Add the mustard, 
salt and pepper and mix well. Cook for two minutes. Remove from the fier and add the cheese, mixing until well blended. Meantime, cook

<center><font size="5" color="#003366"><b>Amuse bouche</b></font></center><p>
According to the food writers, amuse-bouche, the practice of offering tiny works of edible art before dinner,
is a French practice that may have originated in the late 20th century as a part of Nouvelle cuisine. The
first mention of "complimentary amuse-bouche" in the <i>New York Times</i> appeared in an advertisement for New Year's Eve dinner at
Gitane, South Orange NJ [December 29, 1985 (p. NJ17)]. 
References to this item are negligable in the late 1980s-mid 1990s. From the late 1990s to present
references to amuse-bouche proliferate.
<p>
"Eating a chef's amuse bouche -- the bite-sized, predinner course sometimes known as an
"appeteaser" -- can be like hearing a great opera singer hum in the shower or watching a pro
quarterback play catch in his backyard. Tiny in scale and largely unrestricted by the concerns of
full-scale menu offerings, amuse bouche dishes often serve as a chef's sketch pad. And many
chefs call the modest little offerings one of their favorite preparations to dream up....An
increasingly popular offshoot of ritzy French traditionalism, amuse bouche literally means,
"mouth pleaser." Striving to excite the palate in a mere one or two bites, an amuse bouche often
takes shape as a dish that never would work as an entree. That allows chefs freedom to stretch
out and challenge culinary conventions while pampering guests with a typically free,
unannounced sampling of things to come."<br>
---"Amuse Bouche: A Tantalizing Teaser that Whets the Appetite," Andy Battaglia, <i>Nation's Restaurant News</i>, May 1, 2000 (p. 41)
<p>
"The amuse bouche (ah-MYOOZ boosh), or palate teaser, is a tiny predinner mouthful that arrives compliments of the
chef. The amuse may be a small fry, but it's becoming the big catch at fine restaurants across the country."Amuses aren't
new, but they're more popular than ever," says Jean Joho, chef-owner of Chicago's Everest. He offers every patron his
signature creation, cauliflower fondant with caviar...Though hors d'oeuvres are also miniature morsels, they're not amuses.
"An hors d'oeuvre or canape is something that's passed around when people are standing up at a cocktail party or
reception," Kinch says. "Amuses are usually served with a knife and fork." Or a cup. Kinch and other chefs sometimes
offer a soup or consomme amuse, served in espresso cups...When the nouvelle cuisine movement ushered in an era of
smaller portions, amuses gave diners an extra bite and chefs an extra chance to strut their culinary stuff. But when the
popularity of nouvelle waned, so did that of the minimouthfuls. "Amuses became unfashionable during the late '80s, but
recently they've returned to fashion," Joho says. "I'm a fan of serving them because it's a way of being creative."
Traditionally, an amuse is offered before the appetizer, but it may show up at other times. "You can have a predessert
amuse," Kinch says . "A sorbet or granita served between the main course and dessert fits the amuse category.""<br>
---"Bite-size amusements Tiny palate teasers whet trendy diners' appetites," Cathy Hainer, <i>USA Today</i>, February 26,
1999 (p. 9)
<p>
"Amuse-bouche...are today what hors d'oeuvres were to America in the 1950s: a relatively unknown freature of French
culinary tradition that, once introduced, immediately became standard fare. Chefs at many fine restaurants offer guests an
amuse-bouche...before the meal is served." (inside book jacket)  "I vividly recall my first trip to France in 1980...I grabbed
a cab and raced to Paris, worried I might miss my reservation at Jamin, Joel Robuchon's famed restaurant...Once I was
seated...a tiny bite of ethereal food was placed in front of me. It was my very first exposure to the custom of greeting a
diner with amuse-bouche." <br>

Our research suggests "Chefs Tables," as we know them today, are a modern twist on a century-old French tradition. Historic newspaper articles confirm this 
dining option was available, by invitation only, in the US in the second half of the 20th century. Chef's Tables, as a public dining option, were actively promoted by 
celebrity restauranteurs in the 1990s. What is old becomes new. 
<p>
We find nothing in our French culinary history resource specifically discussing Chef's tables. The tradition of chefs, cooking staff and waitstaff dining together before 
serving the night's meal is hundreds of years old. This reason entirely practical: <ol>
<li> Staff needed to be fueled before the long night ahead. 
<li>Waiters tasting the day's special offerings were better informed when it came to making suggestions to patrons.

"Pat Nixon and Spiro Agnew were guests several years ago at 'chef's table' dinner at the Century Plaza Hotel. In fact, 
celebrities are often invited to the chef's tables in fine hotels in the United States. The custom of inviting selected 
people to dine at the chef's table, located in the chef's office in the hotel's kitchen, was started in France at least 
100 years ago. Invitation to dine where the chef and his assitants have their meals are usually reserved for special 
occasions and generally are issued to preview a new entree, to introduce a new chef or to taste the menu the chef
 recommends for a special dinner. It has always been the custom to keep seating at the 'chefs table' to 10 or fewer."<br>

"In Europe, the chef's table for more than a century has been the place for entertaining friends and
family of the chef. After reading about the custom, Charlie Trotter decided to have a chef's table
in his kitchen when he opened his eponymous restaurant in Chicago in 1987...Chefs' tables are proliferating in all parts of
 the country."<br>

<p>
Charlie Trotter's currently offers diners a <a href="http://www.charlietrotters.com/restaurant/cuisine/menu.asp?menuID=15">
kitchen table</a> experience.

"Most agree the chef's table got its start in Europe more than a century ago. Chefs, who worked long hours, wanted to see their family and friends so they fed them in the kitchen. The concept has evoled into a feast of a dinner than can include six to 12 smaller-sized courses, specially concocted after guests choose their wine or other beverages. many cheftfs' tables are so popular they are booked for weeks, often months, in advance. Trotter, for example, claims his table is the most sought after in Chicago. So who would be willing to shell out as much as $100 to $150 a person...to dine in a busy kitchen? Some are celebrities who want to avoid pointing fingers and autograph hounds...Some are business types looking to stage the ultimate power meal. And still others are out to impress a date or celebrate a special occasion. David Brill, a restaurant consultant, puts it another way. 'Basically, it's for the chef's friends...'...Even Trotter admits that life at a chef's table doesn't always go as planned...He also runs into the occasionally rowdy group that has to be asked to quiet down while in his kitchen. On the flip side, a chef's table helps set a restaurant aparat in cities that are saturated with eateries."

Food historians tell us food served in coffee houses was  generally a prix fix affair with a set menu established daily by the proprietor. Similar to the bills of fare
served at contemporary taverns, inns, and boarding houses. The primary purpose of coffee houses was intellecutal stimulation, sharing news, conducting business
 transactions and fostering social comraderie. Food was served, but it wasn't featured. Some <a href="restaurants.html#americancoffeehouses">
American coffee houses</a> also proffered finer dining options. These early bills of fare were not preserved. What we know about the foods 
served in these establishments is gleaned from primary sources: inventories, ledgers, letters, and journals. 20th century
<a href="internet.html#cybercafe">Cybercafes</a> run a close parallel. A short course in the genesis of European coffee houses:</b>
<p>
"Once the Ethiopians discovered coffee it was only a matter of time until the drink spread through trade with the Arabs across the narrow band of the Red Sea...
While coffee was first considered a medicine or religious aid, it soom slipped into everyday use. Wealthy people had a coffee room in their homes, reserved only for 
ceremonial imbibing. For those who did not have such private largesse, coffe houses, known as kaveh kanes, sprang up. By the end of the fifteenth century, Muslim
pilgrims had introduced coffee throughout the Islamic world in Persia, Egypt, Turkey, and North Africa, making it a lucrative trade item. As the 
drink gained in popularity throughout the sixteenth century, it also gained its reputation as a troublemaking brew. Various rules decided that people were having too much fun
in the coffee houses...Why did coffee drinking persist in the face of persecution in these early Arab societies? The addititive nature of caffeine provides one answer...
yet there is more to it. Coffee provided an intellectual stimulant, a pleasant way to feel increased energy without any apparent ill effects...In 1616 the Dutch, who dominated the
world's shipping trade, managed to transport a [coffee] tree to Holland from Arden...At first Europeans didn't know what to make of the strange new brew. In 1610 traveling
British poet Sir George Sandys noted that the Turks sat "chatting most of the day" over their coffee, which he described as "blacke as soote, and tasting not much
unlike it."...Europeans eventually took to coffee with a passions...In the first half of the seventeeth century, coffee was still and exotic beverage, and like other such rare
substances as sugar, cocoa, and tea, initailly was used primariy as an expensive medicine by the upper classes. Over the next fifty years...Euroepans were to discover the social
as well as the medicinal benefits. By th 1650s coffee was sold on Italian streets by aquadedratajho, or lemonade vendors, who dispensed coffee, chocolate, and liquor as
as well. Venice's first coffeehosue opened in 1683...Surprisingly...the French lagged behind the Italisans and British in adopting the coffeehouse...It wasn't until 1689 when 
Francois Procope, and Italian immighrant, opened his Cafe de Procope directly opposite the Comedie Francaises, that the famous French coffeehouse took root...The
French historian Michelet described the advent of coffee as "the auspicious revolution of the times, the great envent which created new customs, and even
modified human temperament."...The coffeehouses of continental Europe were egalitarian meeting places where..."men and women could, without impropriety, consort
as they had never done before. They could meet in public places and talk."...Coffee arrived in Vienna a bit later than in France...Coffee and coffeehouses reached Germany in 
the 1670s. By 1721 there were coffeehouses in most major German cities...Coffee and coffee houses took London by storm. By 1700 there were more than two
thousand London coffeehouses, occupying more premises and paying more rent than any other trade. They came to be known as penny universities, because for that price
one could purchase a cup of coffee and sit for hours listening to extraordinary conversations...Each coffeehouse specialized in a different type of clientele. On one, 
physicians could be consulted. Other served Protestants, Puritans, Catholics, Jews, literati, mercahnts, traders, fops, Whigs, Torries, army officers, actors, lawyers, clergy,
or wits....Not that most coffeehouses were universally uplifting places; rather, they were chaotic, smelly, wildly energetic, and capitalistic."<br>

"The first British coffee house was opened in Oxford in 1650 by Jacob, a Turkish Jew. Two years later, Pasqua Rosee, who was either Armenian or Greek, opened one
in London. Coffee has been seen as a subversive substance at various points in its history. At one time, Islam perceived the convivality it fostered as a threat to 
religious life; the mosques were empty, the coffee houses full."<br>

Coffee accelerates digestion, corrects crudities, removes cholic and flatulencies. It mitigates headaches, cherishes the animal
spirits, takes away listlessness and languor, and is serviceable in all obstructions arising from languid circulation. It is a 
wonderful restorative to emaciated constitutions, and highly refreshing to the studius and sedentary. The habitual use of coffee would
greatly promote sobriety, being in itself a cordial stimulant; it is a most powerful antidote to the temptation of spiritous
liquors. It will be found a welcome beverage to the robust labourer, who would despise a lighter drink."<br>

<b>About coffee houses in colonial & early America</b><br>
Early American movers and shakers met in coffeehouses, taverns and other public dining venues. Coffee houses, descending
from <a href="restaurants.html#coffee">European roots</a>, became hotbeds of commerce and political discourse. Why coffee houses? Because
they offered decisionmakers a place to conduct business without the aid (or distraction) of alcohol. It is interesting to 
note that early American coffee houses were not alcohol-free. In order to stay is businesss, a savvy owner had to cater
to all beverage tastes. Special rooms or whole floors were designated "coffee" areas. 
<p> 
"New York coffee houses in the eighteenth century followed the European mould as centres of business and politics but failed to emulate their literary cast...Coffee 
houses frequently doubled as court house and council chambers...and during the Revolution were a vital nexus for spreading the news. The Exchange Coffee House
 was opened in the 1730s and became an unofficial auction house and commodity exchange. It moved several times and was soon ecliped by the Merchants' at the
 corner of the present Wall and Water Streets...During the war of Independence the Merchants' was effectively the seat of the revolutionary government...When the
 British occupied the city, it became the loyalist centre of trading and news..."<br>

"Toward the end of the seventeenth cnetury the fashion for coffee and chocolate houses of the kind then the rage in London (which had two thousand of them by 
1698) hit American shores as a diversion from the more ruffian taverns. In 1670 Dorothy Jones of Boston announced she would be serving coffee and chocolate
 in her new establishment, and the idea caught on fast. In the same year the New York Merchants' Coffee House opened, later earning the reputation as being
 "birthplace of the American Union." Coffeehouses were considered somewaht more civilized than taverns for gentlemen to meet it, although alcohol and food 
were served in both. In the next century coffee houses grew into lavish establishments, like New York's Tontine Coffee House, which was built in 1794 on the
 corner of Wall and Water Streets. It housed the stock exchange and insurance offices...the Tontine had...a tearoom, a dining room, mahogany furniture, and
 crystal chandeliers, all of which drew a rising middle class whose expectations of comfort were increasingly a matter of competition among tavernkeepers...New
 York's Tontine eventually offered at least a dozen dishes a day."<br>

  "Slaves did the cooking (everyone but the poorest Romans had at least one or two),
  leaving the mistress of the house free to oversee the acquisition of supplies and the state
  of stock on hand. The richest people even had well-paid cooks (coci); those unable to
  afford a regular cook hired on when needed for a banquet."<br>
  ---<i>A Taste of Ancient Rome</i>, Ilaria Gozzini Giacosa, tranlsated by Anna Herklotz,
  forward by Mary Taylor Simeti [University of Chicago Press:Chicago] 1992 (p. 21)
  <p>
  "The Roman matron didn't cook. In all other countries and provinces a woman's place
  was in the kitchen, but in Rome cooking was a slave's job...Famous gourmets, like
  Lucullus and Apicious, were a dab hand with the pots and pans but so too were emperors,
  like Vitellius and Heliogabalus. True gourmets found cooking too important to leave it to
  slaves:  Alexis also makes it clear in the play  The Pit' that the art of cooking is a fitting
  occupation of the freeborn. For the cook in that play is far from being a bumpkin. Indeed,
  the cookery writers Kerakleides and Glaucus of Locris also clearly state that the art of
  cookery should not be left to slaves or even to ordinary freedmen.' (Anth. XIV-661e)...On
  special occasions a hired cook came to demonstrate his arts. The plays o f Plautus, form
  the third century BC, feature many commercial cooks. They are independent-minded,
  humorous figures, with a tendency to boast. As freelance businessmen they sometimes
  had their own retinue of slaves--kitchen helpers, but also waiters, flautists and dancers--so
  that they could provide complete party service. The chef was called the archmagirus, or
  magirus, the sous-chef was the vicarius supra cocos, and there were other cooks below
  him. Some rich people owned hundreds of cooks, whom they took with them when they
  travelled. Others hired additional cooks only for parties. Most cooks, however, were
  slaves, with all the restrictions that that implied...Cooks were for sale in the slave markets
  as bakers, grinders, buyers, carvers, chefs and so on. The question of finding the right
  person for the right job. This was no simple matter, because the slaves were in

  "Cooks were highly paid and sought-after professionals. From the fifth century BC many
  cookbooks were written by philosophers, physicians, cooks and gourmets for the
  instruction of philosophers, physicians, cooks and gourmets. Unfortunately, with the
  exception of a compilation or recipes that survived in two manuscripts from the late
  fourth or early fifth centuries inder the name of Apicius, and the massive work of
  Atheneus from the end of the second or the beginning of the third century, none survived.
  The Deiphosophistae of Athenaeus is, on the other hand, a treasure trove of information,
  gossip, legend, literary quotation, ethnography, potted history, philosophical and medical
  lore and the like, all centered around dining, food and drink. ..They claim that the good
  cook must penetrate nature, know something about medicine, about the seasons, the
  setting and rising of the stars, in order to be able to prepare food that is nourishing and
  will be  properly digested and exhaled'...On a less exhalted plane, cooks claimed to know
   what was good for digestions, for promoting regularity, and for averting all sort of
  sicknesses and plagues and chills."<br>

     "Chef. A person who prepares food as an occupation in a restaurant, private house
     or hotel...Chefs have occupied an important role in society from the 5th century
     BC onwards and in the Middle Ages, with the creation of guilds, they constituted
     a hierarchical community. In France, in the reign of Henri IV, the guilds split up
     into several separate branches: rotisseurs were responsible for la grosse viande
     (the main cuts of meat), patissiers dealt with poultry, pies and tarts, and
     vinaigriers made the sauces. The traiteurs (caterers) included the master chefs, the
     cooks and the porte-chapes (the chape was a convex cover to keep dishes hot), and
     they had the privilege of organizing weddings and feasts, collations and various
     meals at home. These chefs cuisiniers (head cooks), as they were now called,
     served a period of apprenticeship, at the end of which they had to create a
     masterpiece of meat or fish. High-ranking chefs were revered, and some of them,
     like Taillevent, were raised to the nobility. The most famous of all was
     undoubtedly Careme. Under the Ancien Regime, a distinction was made between
     the officier de cuisine, who was the actual cook, and the officier de bouche, who
     was in fact the butler...From the 19th century onwards, chefs wore a large white
     hat to distinguish them from their assistants...It seems that the hat first made its
     appearance in the 1820s."<br>

     "Chef is a French word, which has entered other languages, denoting a
     professional cook. It is a contraction of the phrase chef de cuisine hence originally
     a description of rank as much as, if not more, than, occupation...Although there
     had obviously always been cooks in charge of other cooks--there is the 15th-century description of the chief cook whos job was tasting and testing, not
     cooking--the phrase itself did not appear before the beginning of the 19th century,
     passing quickly from France to England and other countries...Before that chefs
     were called cooks, sometimes qualified as man-cooks, master-cooks, cook-maids,
     professed cooks, principal cooks, or even (in the case of La Chapelle on the title-page of <i>The Modern Cook</i>, 1733)  chief cook'. In particularly grand and
     conservative establishments in France before the Revolution, the head cook might
     be called ecuyer de cuisine, supported by ranks of specialists such as rotisseurs,
     patissiers, and so forth, as well as a body of cuisiniers...The adoption of a new
     professional description must surely reflect a change in cooks'
     circumstances...Into this vacuum floated the possibility of a new breed of cook:
     the artist-cook, described with eloquence and conviction by the most influential
     practitioner and writer of the decades, Antonin Careme, who both orchestrated
     developments in contemporary haute cuisine and acted as role model to many
     aspiring cooks...Careme offered an intellectual platform for cooks to redefine their
     professional status, while the way in which high cookery was developing towards
     stratified working methods to achieve complex culinary ends gave practical
     reasons for at least some cooks to rise to the top of the heap...In his own writings,
     Careme refers to the rank of chef de cuisine..It was the invation of territory
     hitherto occupied by the steward of the household (in England) that gave the cook
     new status...when the cook began to compose his own menus as well as design his
     own pieces montees and supervise the order of service, it was a defininate
     extension of his duties into the realm of steward, and would be utter conquest
     when the clerk of the kitchen and provision of all supplies became subject to the
     chef as well. The job definitions of the British cook and author Charles Elme
     Francatelli (1805-76), a student of Careme's, indicate the shifts in function. At the
     outset of his career he was the chef de cuisine...In its passage into other languages,
     particularly English, the word chef has come to stand alone, and describe function
     more than status...Victor Hugo, discussing Careme's patronage of the arts during
     his time with James de Rothschild, calls him cuisiner...never chef; the French
     trade association was one of cuisiniers, not chefs...It was in fact the organizational
     reforms by Escoffier's generation that caused the extension of the term  chef' to a
     wider body of workers....Chefs were invariably male, largely because a large
     restaurant kitchen was a man's world. Women who worked commercially
     remained cook, cuisiners, or "meres" such as Mere Poulard of omelette fame.
     Since technology and social progress have allowed the entry of more women into
     the once all-male brigades, so they have also been given the same titles."<br>

     <b>Who was Antonin Careme?</b><br>
     Careme was one of the most famous culinary figures of the 19th century. He is credited for several significant
     professional reforms and elevating the profession of chef to the status we know today.
     <p>
     "Careme, Marie-Antoine( known as Antonin) French chef and pastrycook (born Paris,
     1783; died Paris, 1833). Born into a large and very poor family, the young Careme was
     put out on the street at the age of ten, to be taked in by the owner of low-class restarurant
     at the Maine gate; where he learned the rudiments of cookery. At 16, he became an
     apprentice to Bailly of the Rue Vivienne, one of the best pastrycooks in Paris. Amazed by
     Careme's abilities and willingness to learn, Bailly encouraged him, in particular by allowing
     him to study in the print-room of the National Library. Here Careme copied architectural
     drawings, on which he based his patisserie creations; these were greatly admired by
     Baily's customers, including the First Consul himself. Careme met Jean Avice, an
     excellent practitioner of cuisine, who also advised and encouraged him. Then the young
     man's talents became noticed by Tallyrand, who was a customer at Bailly's and he
     offered to take Careme into his service.
          Careme's genius. For 12 years Careme managed the Tallyrand kitchens. The culinary
     and artistic talents of his chef enabled Tallyrand to wield gastronomy effectively as a
     diplomatic tool. Careme also served the Prince Regent of England, the future King
     George IV, and was then sent to the court of Tsar Alexander I; he was responsible for
     introducing some classic Russian dishes into French cuisine, including borsch and
     koulibiac. Careme numbered among the other employers the Viennese Court, the British
     Embassy, Princess Bagration and Lord Steward. He spent his last years with Baron de
     Rothschild and died at 50,  burnt out by the flame of his genius and the charcoal of the
     roasting-spit' (Laurent Tailhad), but having realized his dream:  To publish a complete
     book on the state of my profession in our times.'
          The works written by Careme include <i>Le Patissier pittoresque</i> (1815), <i>Le Maitre d'hotel
     francais</i> (1822), Le Patissiere royal parisien (1825), and, above all, <i>L'Art de la cuisine au
     XIXe siecle</i> (1833). This last work was published in five volumes; the last two were written
     by his follower, Plumery...
          Careme's contribution. A theoretician as well as a practitioner, a tireless worker as well
     as an artistic genius., Careme nonetheless had a keen sense of fashionable and
     entertaining. He understood that the new aristocracy, born under the Consulat, needed
     luxury and ceremony. So he prepared both spectacular and refined recipes, including
     chartreuses, desserts on pedastals, elaborate garnishes and embellishments, new
     decorative trimmings and novel assemblies. A recognized founder of French grand
     cuisine, Careme placed it at the forefront of national prestige. His work as theoretician,
     sauce chef, pastrycook, designer and creator of recipes raised him to the pinnacle of his
     profession...Careme was proud of his unique art: sensitive to decoration and struck on
     elegance, he always has a sense of posterity. He wanted to create a school of cookery
     that would gather together the most famous chefs, in order to  set the standard for beauty
     in classical and modern cookery, and attest to the distant future that the French chefs of
     the 19th century were the most famous in the world'...Careme was also concerned with
     details of equipment. He redesigned certain kitchen utensils, changed the shape of
     saucepans to pour sugar, designed moulds and even concerned himbself with details of
     clothing, such as the shape of the hat."<br>

<b>Why (in history) were most chefs men?</b><br>
Chefs were traditionally men for the same reasons as lawyers, doctors, professors, military
  officers, clerics. In most cultures, professional positions of power were restricted to free
  males. Only recently have women begun to break these ranks.
<p>
<b>Who was the first recorded chef in the world?</b><br>
     Interesting question. The food history books do not offer a simple answer. Instead,
     they describe the history and evolution of the profession we now call  chef'. In
     sum, people have been cooking grand meals for others for thousands of years.
     They were not called chefs, however. The culinary profession was stratified by
     guilds during the Middle Ages. Some of these guilds (think labor unions) had the
     word "chef" in the title. "Chef cuisiner," or head cook was one of these. Many
     significant professional reforms were made in the early 19th century, including the
     eventual elevation of chef cuisiner (chief cook) to one in charge of all aspects of
     kitchen management. Many of the most famous "chefs" (as we think of them
     today) were not called such during their own times. 
     <p>
     Food historians generally credit Apicius (4th century?), a Roman cook, for
     recording (writing) the first cookbook. There is much discussion regarding the
     both the author and the cookbook. You will find a brief discussion in Alan
     Davidson's Oxford Companion to Food (p. 24). In a broad interpretation of the
     term  chef' Apicius might be the answer you are looking for. Certainly, recipes
      <a href="foodfaq3.html#firstrecipes">were recorded</a> long before Apicius

<b>ABOUT CHEF'S UNIFORMS</b><br>
The history and evolution of the chef's uniform is a fascinating and complicated topic. 
 Christine Crawford-Oppenheimer, former reference librarian at The Culinary Institute, observes much of the "popular"  literature circulating on  this subject falls 
into the category of  folklore. Her research confirms contemporary chef's uniforms descend from the long march of practical occupational costumes. Case in point? The "Toque 
Blanche." The term, on its most basic level, means a fitted white headcovering. Primary evidence confirms headgear worn by head chefs through the years varied according to 
culture and period. Long before the "Toque Blanche" denoted a striking headpiece visually calling out kitchen rank, it referred to a respected gastronomic fraternity. 
 It was not until the 20th century that tall, white, pleated culinary crowns reigned supreme.  Black chef's toques offer their own curious parallel history.
Scholars like Ms. Crawford-Oppenheimer challenge us to question tantalizing stories of chef-wear resulting from cooks hiding in early Greek [Byzantine]
 monasteries and <a href="restaurants.html#100pleats"> 100 pleats for 100 ways to prepare eggs</a>.  "Facts" repeated by several sources have an insipid way of becoming their

"Evolution of chef's dress...this dress is not really of great antiquity but is the outcome rather of gradual evolution. It appears to have been
completely standarized only during the full blossoming of the hotel industry in this [20th] century. Cooks in medieval kitchen
kitchens appeared to work in a variety of costumes of which some sort of apron would seem to be the only common denominator. Bt
Victorian times...There is no doubt that working dress (apart from its functional purpose) plays an important part in establishing morale and in 
heightening or diminishing job prestige...Because of the nature of the work he has to do it is equally important that it is worn with intelligent
regard for its purpose, which includes, importantly, the maintenance of hygiene and the aiding of cool working."<br>

<b>The Toque, folklore:</b><br>
"The tall white hat, or toque, symbolizes the art of fine cooking throughout much of the world. Some sources say that the toque originated in Assyria in the mid-seventh-century B.C., when 
King Assurbanipal lived in fear of being poisoned. He required the head cooks in wealthy households to wear pleated cloth headdreses similar to those worn by the 
royalty. This headgear served both to identify the cooks of a particular household and to encourage allegiance. A second legend traces the toque back to antiquity, when
rulers presented master culinarians with bonnet-like caps studded with laurel leaves, emblems of the ruler's office, in a ceremony that marked the beginning of all
official feasts. Yet another tale situates the origin of the toque at the end of the sixth century A.D., when barbarians from northern Europe overran the Byzantine Empire. To
escape persecution, philosophers and artists fled to Greek monasteries for refuge, where they found themselves in the company of Orthodox priests who enjoyed good
food. This legend tells that many of the refugees became cooks in the monastery kitchens, adopting the cassock and headgear of the priests to disguise themselves. However, they
chose to wear white instead of traditional black, as  a mark of individuality. Of course, none of these accounts can be verified and most likely the chef's toque 
evolved over time, with no single country or culture entirely responsible for its creation. The French word <i>toque</i>, by was of the Spanish <i>toca</i>, originally referred to a head
covering worn by both men and women. Eventually, the toque took the shape of a small, round, close-fitting or "crown" of cloth with a gathering of material that was often 
pleated to cover the top of the head. By the sixteenth century, the characteristics of the hat varied from country to country...we must credit the famous chef Antonin Careme...
with bringing the modern toques into the kitchen. He is said to have been inspired to change his floppy, beret-style cap when he saw a woman wearing a stiff, white hat on the
street one day. <br>
---"The Chef's Uniform," The Culinary Institute of America, <i>Gastronmica</i>, Winter 2001 (p. 89-90)
<p>
"In the days of the ancient Greek and Roman empires, at festivals which lasted weeks...the Master Culinarians, prior to serving the food, 
were called before the rulers who crowned them with a bonnet-like cap, studded with laurel leaves, an emblem of their office. This ceremony
marked the beginning of the feast...at noted Papal dinners, where the food was prepared by monks, we find only that expert culinarians
wore the white cap, whereas the novices remained bareheaded...during the reign of Napoleon Bonaparte, the ordinary skull caps came into style
and these were worn by apprentices, workers, and expert chefs, varying only in colors according to rank. During the same period, deeds of 
exceptional value and creative skill in cookery were rewarded by allowing the creator to wear the white cap--Toque Blanche--for
a period of time befitting the merit of his deed...M. Boucher, chef of the Prince de Tallyrand in the early part of the 18th century, is 
credited with having brought the Toque Blanche into mode...An interesting and unusal story is told of Germain Chevet. Chevet, who was the
creator of a rose of rare beauty, was ordered to cultivate this specie exclusively for Louis XIV, King of France. When Chevet arrived in Paris, 
during the outbreak of the French Revolution, he founded a restaurant bearing his name at the Palais Royal which became the favorite
meeting place of the gourmets. This restaurant was surrounded by beds of the famous King's rose, and Chevet insisted that each 
member of his culinary staff wear a fresh rose in the crown of his Toque Blanche every day..."<br>
---"La Toque Blanche," Alfred G. Wagner, Chef, <i>Culinary Review</i>, January 1939 (p. 27)
<p>
<b>The facts:</b><br>
"Of course, the matter of kitchen headgear immediatedly brings to mind the outlandish tower of cloth that is the true chef's hat, or 
toque (French for a soft, brimless, usually small hat). Could it be that this evidence had evolved or been invented for venerable chefs
with career-weakened eyes?...The origin of the chef's toque are somewhat obscure. The distingushed gastronomical authority Andre Simon said that it is a copy
of the had worn by Greek Orthodox priests and dates from a time of upheaval (some say the sixth century A.D.) when "many famous cooks to
escape persecution sought refuge in monasteries." Other investigations into the subject, however, make it clear that
regardless of what may have happened in early Greece, monasteries, today's toque was reinvented around 1900. In both France and England
in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, those cooks who bothered with headgear at all wore a soft cotton hat, or  bonnet, 
that looked very much like a nightcap. The great transition from shapeless to shaped can be attributed with some certainty to Marie-Antoine
Careme, the renowned chef of the early nineteenth century, who at the time was in the service of the English ambassador to Vienna, 
Lord Stewart. As Careme wrote in his <i>Maitre d'Hotel francais</i> (1822), 'Meditating ceaselessly on the elegance of our work, I had
dreamed for a long time of ways to change the manner in which we wear our cotton cap; for it appeared to me absolutely necessary not to change the 
cap itself, whose whiteness allies it so well to the rest of our uniform, and whose extreme cleanliness is the handsomest endowment of
the cook. Professionals distinguish themselves by it, and by the order that they bring to their work...At the time that I had the 
idea of wearing my cap thus trimmed with a circle of cardboard (one could make it an octagon), which lends it more grace, I found
myself in Vienna during my last stay in 1821. Every day around eleven in the morning, I repesented the dinner menu to his 
Excellency Lord S--------. The Ambassador looked at me, smiled, and said: 'This new style better suits the cook.' I pointed out to his
Excellency that a cook should be the image of good health, while our ordinary cap is more reminiscent of the state of
convalescence. My Lord agreed, and I never gave up my new headgear. My young men took it up, and several cooks of Vienna admired
their newly fashionable selves, never doubting that they would find devotees in Paris.' Careme's modest effort at bestowing a little
"grace" on the chef's cap ushered in a new era of experimentation. The following decades tossed up a number of new styles, from 
pill-box shaped porkpie hats...to tam o'shanters...from black berets ato great cotton puffs swept backwards. Out of the welter of 
invention arose the modern toque, which Phillis Cunnington and Catherine Lucas, two historians of English costume, call 'one of the 
tallest hats ever to dignify a man.' Dignify, they suggest, is the true meaning of the toque; high hats have quite frequently adorned
the leaders of social groups and lent them a commensuraltey imposing physical stature."<br>
---<i>The Curious Cook</i>, Harold McGee [Macmillan:New York] 1990 (p. 28+)
     <p>
 
     "Unlike Talleyrand or the Prince Regent...Lord Stewart met his celebrity chef in the
     kitchens--Careme's domain. And here, in 1821, he first noticed a difference in his chef's
     appearance. Antonin had take to wearing a raised hat, a sort of toque, in contract to the
     white nightcaps usually worn in kitchens in those days. When Stewart, in his halting
     French, asked why, Antonin said he felt a chef should not dress as for a sickbed--perhaps
     after the unfortunate demise of La Grande Bagration who never recovered from the
      'almost total inactivity' that overcame her on her diet of pure Careme. Antonin's insistence
     on stiffening his white hat was imitated first by the chefs of Vienna, then Paris, and then
     everywhere. Antonin later published an illustration of the cap, stiffened with a round of
     cardboard and later still he even suggested--in an early example of celebrity-chef product
     endorsement--the best place to buy one: the bonnetier M. Pannier, on the boulevard de la
     Madeleine in Paris."<br>

<b>Black caps?</b><br>
"The mystery of the 'Black Hat Chefs' has been solved thanks to William J. Spry, executive chef, Hotel Dorset, NYC...Spry, who is a 
native of England, wrote to his friends there to get the factual history...Here is what he reports: 'In the Middle Ages, British cooking
was known as Baronial Cooking. As a tradition the main course of a meal consisted of huge roasts, barons of beef, lamb, wild boar, or 
venison were roasted on a spit above a large roaring fire, which in most casts was beneath a huge chimney breast. The task of suervising
this operation was of course undertaken by the Master Cook. This mean that anyone operating a spit was in danger of his hat 
receiving a large amount of soot and debris falling down the chimney. Thus for all practical purposes, the Black Cap was more 
serviceable than a white one, and so it evolved that the Master Cook always wore a short Black Cap. As the kitchens of these Baronial
Halls were quite often a considerable distance from the dining hall, the cap of the cook was pressed flat to enable him to carry the
huge platter on his head..."<br>

<p>
"The great Alexis Soyer even when in 'whites' did not wear the high bonnet, the toque...but a somewhat flamboyant creation which 
approximated to a tasselled beret in black velvet. Even after Soyer's day the white hat was by no means de rigeur amongst all chefs
and in the last ten years of the nineteenth century there were many instances of chefs like M. Claudius...who wore a headgear
something like a librarian's black skull cap. Indeed, in a cookery book published in 1919 there is a photograph of Victor
Hirtzler who was chef of the Hotel St. Francis, San Francisco, wearing a dark skull cap very much of this pattern. He is dressed
otherwise in the chef's costume familiar today. In this country [UK], a similar black skull cap is still worn by the master cook...at the 
famous English-style restaurant, Simpson's in the Strand. It has accordingly been inferred that this is specifically an English
cook's distinctive insignia but as has already been noted there is pictorial evidence that chefs of other nationalities have, 
in relatively recent times, sported a head-dress not dissimilar."<br>

a leap year. In 1843 he published Les Classiques de la table, in which he devoted many pages to the history of gastronomy. He also wrote several articles. As principal 
steward of the emperor's household, he looked after the wardrobe, the furniture and the provisions of the court. When Louis XVIII succeeded Napoleon, it is said that at first

     "Almost as distinguishing as the toque blanche is the veste blanche, or double-breasted
     white jacket. Its military style is no accident of fashion. The earliest chefs were servants of
     kings and could very possibly have been called upon to serve on the battlefield as well as
     the dining hall. Much less has been written about the chef's coat than about the toque.
     Most references suggest that white was chosen to emphasize good sanitation. Jackets
     ranged from long-sleeved coats fashioned after papal dress to costumes derived from
     rural dress, which included a jacket covered by a long apron and worn with a knotted
     kerchief around the neck. The jacket protected the chef from the heat, as it still does
     today. The coat has other advantages, as well. A split at the cuff seam allows the cuffs to
     be turned back, giving the chef a neat an professional appearance that would be lost
     through rolled-up sleeves; at the same time it ensure protection to the forearms and wrists
     in the event of a splatter or spill. The double-breasted design offers a quick fix for hiding
     soiled areas, since the panels can easily be reversed to regain a crisp, white, professional
     appearance."<br>

<b>Chef's Pants and Apron</b><br>
"The history of the chef's checkered pants is the most difficult to document. Most sources assume that this fabric was chosen
to camouflage spills. While bakers wore white, chefs turned to either regular black-and-white checks or a houndstooth pattern, 
with the exact color and pattern varying from place to place. Some believe that the houndstooth check originated in the costume
of the English master huntsman. Designed with built-in safety features, chef's pants sometimes have snaps instead fo a zipper
so that they can literally be torn away to prevent bodily burns in the event of an accidental spill. The pant legs are
straight, not cuffed or rolled, so that liquids cannot be trapped at the ankle. The very first chef's uniform was no more than
an apron worn to protect clothing from inevitable splashes and spills. The messier the work, the longer the apron. Butchers
wore long aprons; skilled artisans and craftsmen wore theirs shorter."<br>

Cooking schools, as we know them today, descended from culinary/cooking training programs run by ruling households, 
<a href="restaurants.html#militarycookingschools">military organizations</a> and religious 
establishments (monestaries, abbeys, colleges). Feeding large numbers of people required massive numbers of well-trained staff. Early cooks learned by doing via 
apprenticeships. Antonin Careme is generally credited for elevating the respect of the chef and codifying kitchen staff in 
the 19th century. 
<p>
Who started the first cooking/culinary training school, where and when? The answer depends upon the country and the definition of "school." Early classes enrolling
 tuition-paying students were generally conducted in private quarters, often the teacher's home. These cooking schools catered to women students. Men training for
 top-level culinary positions continued to learn their craft working for master chefs apprenticeship-style well into the 
20th century.
<p>
<b>[17th & 18th century England]</b><br>
"Cookery schools have been going for longer than might imagined, even if most female cooks have commonly learned either at theri mother's knee, or by steady
 climb through the ranks of domestic service. The career of the 17th-century author Robert May is an example of the classic professional formation of the male 
cook. As a child, he worked with his father, cook to a family well entrenched at the English court, then spent his teenage years in the kitchens of a prominent 
French diplomat and lawyer in Paris...He was then formally apprenticed in London to the cook to the Grocers' Company and the court of the Star Chamber before
 returning fully traned to the paternal stove. This model was to hold good well into the 20th century. A necessary foundaton for educational activity...was a didactic
 literature. The earliest recipes might have been, for the most part, the aides-memoire of professional cooks...but by the late 16th century...there were works that 
specifically addressd women...This literature also reveals the existence of schools of cookery, for books were often the outcome of a successful teaching career, or
 were the teaching materials converted to print. From the earliest such book published in England, <i>Rare and Excellent Receipts by Mrs. Mary Tillinghast</i> (1678) '
 Printed for the Use of her Scholars only', to the book 'published for the convenience of the young ladies committed to her care' by Elizabeth Marshall (1777) who ran a pastry 
school in Newcastle-upon-Tyne from about 1770-1790, there were several such instances. The most celebrated is perhaps Edward Kidder, author of 
<i>Receipts of Pastry and Cookery for the Use of his Scholars</i> (c. 1725), who ran a school in several locations in London through the first quarter of the 18th 
century. If an obituarist is to be believed, upwards of 6,000 students passed through his hands. Note that the chief subject of instruction, as in many other schools in
 Britain, and in America where they also existed, was pastry...Many authors turned to teaching. In the late 1670s, Hannah Wooley offered to instruct ladies whos
 lives were dislocated by the Civil War and Restoration and who were thus forced to turn to service for an income...In the 19th century the purpose of culinary 
education changed somewhat. While still pursing...the aims of the early teachers with schools for the middle classes...the same groups saw the need to instruct
 those less fortunate..."<br>

"Four different types of cooking schools emered in America during the nineteeth century. The first was an expansion of the pastry lessons offered by experts during 
the eighteenth century.. The shift between private lessons and public courses was made by Elizabeth Goodfellow, who opened a pastry shop in Philadelphia in 
1808. She subsequently offered lessons, which turned into formal classes offered to the public, and thus establishing 
America's first cooking school."

Vanderbilt's daughter, Blot opened the New York Cooking School, which was America's first French cooking school. It mainly catered to the wealthy and lasted

"Juliet Corson...targeted unemployed working-class women, with the hope that after taking cookery courses they might find employemnt as domestics. Beginning in 
1872, she began lecturing on cooking at charitable institutions in New York City. In November 1867 she launched the city's second New York Cooking School,
 which offered a series of twelve lessons...In 1878 the Boston Cooking School was launched inder the auspices of the Women's Education Association. Maria
 Parloa was the first teacher...The final type of cooking school to emerge during the nineteenth cetnury was based at colleges and universities. The interest in 
cooking schools also influenced college programs. These originally were intended to prepare women for life as homemakers and later were vocationally directed. 
The first known cookery program at a college was at Iowa Agricultural School in Ames (later Iowa State University); in 1876 the school offererd a course in 
domestic economy, which included cooking. The teacher was Mary B. Welch...A kitchen was constructed and in 1878 Welch began teaching the course using

"Culinary experts took to the classroom in the last quarter of the century. Four cooking schools stand out as representative examples of such successful ventures. 
These cooking schools provided helpful cookery and housekeeping information for homemakers as well as career training for women who planned to put skills
 learned in the classsroom toward earning a respectable living. Juliet Corson founded the New York Cooking School. Three outstanding culinary experts, Miss 
Parloa, Mrs. D.A. Lincoln, and Fannie Farmer were associated with the Boston Cooking School, and the Philadelphia Cooking School brought to the attention 
of nineteenth century cooks Sarah Tyson Rorer. All became popular culinary teachers, and each produced cookbooks widely accepted by their readers."<br>

are carried away with the purely spectacular features of military work...At the State Camp...a cooking school has been established, and it is safe to say that no feature of the excellent training established at Peekskill will prove, in time

outfit. The first steps toward such an organization have been taken, and by the time the National Guard, or any part of it, has to be called out for service again the problem of self-sustenance should have been solved. When the next term of active service comes it will

"Cooking School for Soldiers. But of more general importance in the interior of our man-at-arms is the new school for army cooks being built under Gen. Sharpe's direction at Fort Ripley, Kan. This
institution, which will be competed by June 1, will contgain a big cooking school on the groundfloor and barracks above for the eighty student cooks and student bakers. Grouped about two big ranges, 
two classses in session at a time will learn the noble art of tickling the military palate. Each range will be large enough to cook the meals of an entire comapny. The food prepared will be eaten by 
the student cooks themselves and by the...men in the guardhouse. This soldier cooking school, now in temporary quarters at Fort Riley, is one of the most interesting of our military
institutions. Among its student cooks officers and enlisted men, in cap and apron, may be seen working side by side. The corps of instructors is made up of veteran army cooks--some of them colored--
who have made great reputations as culinary artists. When it became known that the army's famous cooks were being detailed for this educational work companies possessed of good ones 
ceased to boast of their merits. Indeed, so secretive have the companions become as to the skill of their superior chefs de cuisine that the commissary department no longer hears of them who mght be
wanted for teachers at fifty cents extra per day--the instructor cook's pay.  So civilian cooks have had to be obtained to fill up the corps of culinary teachers.<b>Get Sergeants Pay</b> All
of the student cooks are men who have volunteered to take the course. There is no dearth of these among the privates, inasmuch as a graduate cook, as soon as he is assigned to an organization, commence to 
draw full seargeant's pay, besides such extra allowance from the company's fund as his skill deserves. Not every private who applies is received at the school, however. Eligable must have a
common school eduation and must have at least two and one-half years before their enlistments will have expired. Besides the extra pay the company cook is relieved from guard and police
duty, but he must take his turn at drill and target practice. Each company is allowed two cooks and generally two 'kitchen police,' who do the kitchen drudgery. The course of the army cooking\
school is four months. The student cook starts in with scullery work and next he learns the handling and cleaning of the range. Then he takes up cooking proper--first the theory and afterward
the practice. In the course of his theory work he must muster some hard problems in food econony and must acquire considerable executive ability. After being taught: to keep accounts and to estimate the
cost of the items...to be required...The student-cook receiving the highest mark in his class at the end of the four months' coruse recieves a prize of $15, and there is always a second prize of 
$10. There is also a school for army bakers at Fort Riley. This occupies a separate building and will continue to do so, even after the new cooking school is completed but the student-bakers will
share the new barracks of the student-cooks. In fact they all belong technically to one institution the 'School of Bakers and Cooks.'"<br>

  "Until the late nineteenth century, delicatessens were primarily run by Germans and Alsatians in
  this country. The word itself derives from German and means delicacies, but is used not only to
  describe a shop, but also is the word for the products sold in a shop. Eventually Jews, too, went
  into the business...Delis were especially attractive for the observant as the stores were open on
  Sundays, selling canned and packaged goods, often duplicating the services of grocery stores.
  More than anything else the delicatessen became the "Jewish eating experience" in this country.
  A deli was a little restaurant with a counter, a few stools and smoked beef, pastrami, frankfurters,
  potato knishes, rye bread, club bread, mustard, and pickles," recalled Norman Podhoretz, editor
  of <i>Commentary Magazine</i>, who grew up in Brownsville, Brooklyn...As Jews became more affluent,
  two distinct types of delicatessens emerged. "An offshoot of the kosher restaurant is the kosher
  delicatassen and lunchroom"...The other type of delicatessen that emerged as Jews became
  assimilated and moved uptown or to Brooklyn or suburbia was the carry-out, or "kosher style" deli.
  It looked and smelled like a kosher delicatessen, but coffee was served with cream. The
  overstuffed pastrami and corned beef sandwiches were served followed by a piece of New York
  cheesecake...The quintessential Jewish "kosher style" delicatessen today is the Carnegie on Fifty-fifth 
and Seventh Avenue in New York."<br>
  ---<i>Jewish Cooking in America</i>, Joan Nathan [Knopf:New York] 1994 (p. 184-6)
  <p>
  "Delicatessen. A grocery store that usually sells cooked meats, prepared food, and delicacies.
  The word is from the German Delikatess, "delicacy." In the 1880s it referred to preserved foods.
  During the period of post-Civil War emigration to America, many Jews set up butcher shops called
  schlact stores, but as more foods were added to the shelves, the term "delicatessen shop,"
  "delicatessen store," and "delicatessen" became common, though some preferred the non-German term "appetizing store." Later on "delicatessen" was shorened to "deli" or "delly," which
  sometimes also referes to the foods sold in such an establishment.
       New York City is still the hub for deli culture and sets the standards for those elsewhere.
  Delicatessens specialize in serving pastrami, potato salad, pickles, rye bread, liverwurst, and
  many other items enjoyed by the Jews of eastern cities. To call such a store a "Jewish
  delicatessen" is, therefore, something of a redundancy, and many delicatessens maintain Kosher
  regulations. But today many other ethnic groups run their own delis, as in "Italian deli" or "Latin-American deli."<br>

  <p>
  "Jewish immigrants did not at first open restaurants, but they took the concept of the schlact, or
  grocery, store to far more delectable and diverse levels than Americans had ever before
  experienced. And, in most cases, one could eat on the premises. The word delicatessen comes
  from the German word, delikatesse, for delicacy, although many New York Jews preferred the
  non-German word "appetizing." The deli counter's display of breads, smoked salmon, dried fish,
  noodle pudding, cured meats, pickles, and oddities like cream soda and celery tonic represented
  American bounty in its most voluptuous and self-indulgent form, and the experience of going to a
  deli--"Jewish deli" would have been a redundancy--became the stuff comedy and heatburn were
  made of. Americans took to the overstuffed sandwiches and fried potatoes with the same relish
  they would to ham-and-cheese sandwiches and French fries, and "deli counters" became as
  much a fixture in American supermarkets as a butcher or dairy case...Most delis were in the Jewish
  neighborhoods of East Coast cities, epecially New York, where delis dimpled the streets of
  Brooklyn, the Bronx, East Harlem, and the Lower East Side, although some of the most famous--Reuben's, the Stage Deli, and the Carnegie Deli--were uptown attractions, as much for their
  celebrity clientele as for their food...The less stringent deli owners became about keeping kosher,

  the more appeal they had to Gentiles, and non-kosher customers."<br>

While most Americans think of fast food in terms of modern chain restaurants, food historians like
to remind us the first "fast food" restaurants were thermopolium, operated by Ancient Romans.
Throughout history most cultures and cuisines developed shortcut options to traditional dining
customs. The concept of modern fast food was a byproduct of the industrial revolution. People on
the go (or working) required fast, economical and portable foods. Street vendors, fair fare, lunch
wagons, diners, roadside eateries, drive-ins, ice cream stands, noodle parlors and sushi bars cater
to this market. Each in its own place and time. According to John Mariani, American food
historian, the phrase "fast food" was first coined by George G. Foster in 1848. It did not become
popular, however, until the 1960s when chain restaurants proliferated.<p>

<b>What is street food?</b><br>
The history of mobile street vending (in the broadest sense) can be traced to military field mess
units. The idea of cooking and serving food from portable canteens evolved over time. Ancient
Romans hawked "street foods" in marketplaces and sold them in sporting venues. Medieval street
foods were sold at fairs, tournaments, and other large gatherings. Today, we sometimes call this
"fast food."
<p>
The types of items consumed "on the street" are generally determined by the tradtional foods of
the country/region. Which foods are most popular? That depends upon the time and place. In the
places where many cultures and cuisine combine, the confluence of street food is a reflection of
the inhabitants.   Food carts were often used by peddlers to sell inexpensive homemade and
manufactured goods. Ice cream and candy were often sold in this fashion. Early carts where
powered by people (pushed, pulled), animals (goats, horses), wheels (bicycles, tricycles) and
motors (cars, trucks).
<p>
This is how one food historian sums up the topic:<br>
"Street food in a given place, is often far more interesting than restaurant food. Generally
speaking, wherever it is found it will be likely to represent well-established local traditions; and in
some places a tour of hawkers' stalls may be the quickest and most agreeable method of getting
the feel of local foods. Among the factors which seem to determine how numerous and diverse
street foods are in this or that country, one is clearly climate--a temperate or warm climate makes
these operations much easier and also produces a larger number of passers-by who are not intent
on getting to somewhere out of the cold. Another factor is the degree of economic development.
Broadly speaking, developed countries have fewer street foods. However, there are many
exceptions or anomalies...there are indeed few generalizations which can be safely made on the
subject. Nor is there much literature available for study...A list of the most famous and
widespread street foods would certainly include ice cream, doughnut, hamburger, and hot
dog."<br>

<b>Public dining in Ancient Rome</b><br>
Historians confirm public dining was widely practiced in Ancient Rome. Urban food service establishments catered
to men of all classes. A variety of options ranging from fast food (<a href="restaurants.html#popina">popina & thermopoliums</a>) to more
leisurely dining (<a href="restaurants.html#ancientromantaverns">taverns</a>) existed. Spectators enjoyed food at the <a href="restaurants.html#colosseum">
Colosseum</a> & <a href="restaurants.html#romansoldiers">Roman soldiers</a> ate as they marched.
Some food service establishments were "fronts" for
more dubious activites. Others were popular meeting places for average people seeking a hot meal. Like today's
shopping mall food courts, Ancient Roman fast food establishments were situated where
people gathered for other reasons. 
<p>
<a name="popina">
<b>Popina & Thermopoliums</b><br>
"For plebian men, social life was virtually synonymous with dining outside the home. Tavernae and popinae were inextricably intertwined, 
and for the common people both symbolized the pleasures of the city. The taberna was primarily a place where beverages were served and food was an afterthought; 
while drinking wine people also ate chickpeas, turnips, and other salted foods, according to a sign found in Osita. The popina was our bar and grill, a restaurant where dinner was served along with drinks. It catered to a plebian clientele. Here social rank ceased to 
matter. The reputation of the popina was rather dubious, however. As in the cities of the Middle Ages, in Rome the tavern was the antechamber to the 
bordello. It was also a place where men gambled with dice. In every popina thick vapors emanated from the stewpot and kettle that were always 
kept boiling on the stove. What people liked about such places was that the food was not just cooked but served hot. We hear of 
'steaming plates' and 'smoking sausages.' Drinks were also served hot." <br>
---"The Broad Bean and the Moray: Social Hierarchies and Food in Rome," Mireille Corbier, <i>Food: A Culinary History from Antiquity 
to Present</i>, Jean-Louis Flandrin and Massimo Montanari [Columbia University Press:New York] 1999 (p. 136) 
<p>
"Not everyone ate at home. There were places in the cities of the Roman Empire where either a full meal or a snack could be 
eaten. Fast-food establishments called popinae served fried fish, ham and sausages, as well as other delicacies, and Catullus mentions the 
pages of an unfortunate historian as being so useless as to be fin only for wrapping up mackerel, so a take-away service was 
also available. But popinae had a reputation as the haunt of drunks, thieves, prostitutes and lazy slaves. Juvenal described in passing an 
all-nigh popina where debauched insomniacs could fritter away the small hours. This literary evidence comes from an upper-class 
perspective, however, and the greasy restaurants, as Horace described them, were probably enjoyed by a large part of the 
population. The remains of these restaurants can be seen at Pompeii and have been studied closely by archaeologists. Similar to the 
popina was the thermopolium or, in a literal translation, a 'place where hot things are sold'. Asellina's thermopolium...had an 
assortment of amphorae and jugs for serving of hot and cold drinks. There were also cosy corners and upper rooms which bear out the 
suggestion made by certain writers that bars and fast-food restaurants were used for other purposes besides eating." <br>

"From sunrise to sunset, Roman urbanites passed the day entirely outside their homes...Inevitably, many of them would grab a 
bite to eat in the city center. This custom brought about the appearance of restorative establishments that came to flourish in the 
Forum and around the thermal baths: from simple taverns (popinae or thermopolia), which offered hot or cold wine according to 
season, cakes made with chick peas, focaccias, and other ready-to-eat items...These public gathering places...looked approximately like 
this: a brickwork serving bar facing the street, containing large amphoras for wine, water, and oil; shelves for mugs and 
glasses; and against the back wall, stoves for preparing a few hot foods or for a quick reheating. Further within there were usually 
at least one rooms sparsely furnished with tables and benches for those customers with the time and desire to eat seated, as was the 
custom among the lower strata of society...The staff in these places is always described in the ancient sources as an assorted 
collection of lowlife: the proprietor was on the same social scale as a thief, and the servants commonly provided less than 
reputable services to their customers upon request...Many popinae were conveniently located immediately inside the baths and in the 
porticoes around the outside...only men at in the popinae..." <br>

<b>Ancient Roman taverns</b><br>
"Rome had countless bars, restaurants and inns...Tabernae, taverns, were found chiefly near the
bathhouses, but also near temples, libraries and other public buildings. There were several
different kinds. Engravings show that they all had an L- or horseshoe-shaped bar made of stone
and cement. In comparison with a modern bar, it was low-just over a metre height. Four or five
clay pots were permanently bricked into the bar, sometimes with a mortar. This meant that they
were well insulated so food and drink could be kept warm or cold in them for a long time. Near
the bar stood a small bronze oven, usually portable, in which water was kept at a boiling point.
The larger taverns had a separate kitchen and a cellar. If the space was large enough, low tables
and stools were arranged close to the bar; otherwise customers had to stand...Food in the taverns
was less spectacular than in wealthy houses, but the proprietors prepared it freshly. Typical dishes
would have included the popular puls (a porridge or rissoto) and dishes with beans, peas or lentils. 
From the time of Emperor Vespasian these were the only dishes dishes taverns were permitted to
serve. Claudius and some other emperors had prohibited the sale of boiled meat, and any tavern
foolish enough to offer it was closed down. Thus to circumvent the law, meat was usually boiled
on the street...We can conclude form this that boiled meat was popular. Frescoes, ancient graffiti
and other sources suggest that roasted meat was also served, such as ham and pig's head, with
eel, olives, figs, possibly sausage, fishballs, meatballs, salads, poultry, marinated vegetables,
cheese, eggs, omelettes and all manner of light snacks (think of Italian antipasto and Spanish
tapas)...Fornax  means  oven', and this restaurant was a sort of pizzeria."<br>

"The more convival side of Rome's night-life is represented by the taverns and hot food stalls.
These were more than a nocturnal luxury: they were also a daily necessity in a crowded city many
of whose poorer inhabitants could not possibly have risked lighting a cooking fire in their
tenements...The noise and aroma of Rome's street food began before sunrise...and continued
throughout the day...Everybody ate street food, even emperors. It was slightly less respectible to
eat in the pervigiles popinae  ever-open cookshops'...The bars and taverns in and around the great
Baths were the nearest thing that Rome had to restaurants. In some you could choose wither to sit
or to recline; and in some you could spend serious money...while the snacks available in others
would be converted into a full meal only by a miser...In some you could demand a certain level
and variety of cuisine for which the ordinary cookshops had no time at all..."<br>

<b>19th century French bistros</b><br>
According to the food historians, bistros are offshoots of cafes. The menu is generally the same.
The difference? Bistros are quick service; cafes are more leisurely establishments.
<p>
"Bistro, a term which dates back only to the late 19th century in French and to the early 20th
century in English, is elastic in its meaning but always refers to an establishment where one can
have something to eat, as well as drinks. Such an establishment would normally be small, and its
menu would be likely to include simple dishes, perhaps of rustic character and not expensive. If it
is correct that the word comes from a Russian one meaning "quick!", this would fit in with the
general idea that one can eat quickly at a bistro. However, the concept of simple inexpensive food
served in a French atmosphere has wide appeal, and as a result the use of the term, whether as a
description of eating places of of food, had, towards the end of the 20th century, begun to be
annexed by more pretentious premises."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
77-8)
<p>
"Bistro. A bar or small restaurant, also known as a bistrot. The origin of this familiar word is
obscure. It first appeared in the French language in 1884, and perhaps comes from the Russian
word bistro (quick), which the Cossacks used to get quick service at a bar during the Russian
occupation of Paris in 1815. There also appears to be a relationship with the word bistreau, which
in the dialects of western France describes a cow-herd and, by extension, a jolly fellow--an apt
description of an innkeeper. The most likely origin is doubtless and abbreviation of  the word
bistrouille. Modern French bistros are of modest appearance and frequently offer local dishes,
cold meats and cheese with their wine."<br>

<p>
"1815. Russian soldiers bivouac in the Place de la Concorde and under the trees of the Tuileries
and the Champs-Elysees at Paris following the Battle of Waterloo...and by some accounts they
introduce the word "bistro" for cafe by ordering waiters to bring orders "bystro, bystro" (quickly,
quickly). French cafe owners cover their counters with zinc to protect them from fist marks and
wine stains (the word "zinc" will become a generic for cafe.).<br>
---<i>The Food Chronology</i>, James Trager [Henry Holt:New York] 1995 (p. 205)
<p>
According to the current edition of Larousse Gastronomique (p. 194-5), the first cafes (defined
generally as places selling drinks and snacks) was established in Constantinople in 1550. It was a
coffee house, hence the word "cafe." Cafes were places educated people went to share ideas and
new  discoveries. Patrons spent several hours in these establishments in one "sitting." This trend
caught on in Europe on the 17th century. When cafes opened in France they also sold brandy,
sweetened wines and liqueurs in addition to coffee. The first modern-type cafe was the Cafe
Procope which opened in 1696.
<p>
<b>First American bistros?</b><br>
The earliest references we're finding in print for American establishments specifically called bistros are from the
1940s. Presumably, the fuzzy line between cafes, bistros and similar European-style eateries makes it difficult to establish with
certainly the first one here. Two of the oldest print references we find are for mid-town establishements
 in New York City. Curiously??! They are both on Third Avenue, only a few doors apart.  
Lawton Mackall's <i>Knife and Fork in New York</i> [Country Life Press:Garden City 1949] describes Le Bistro, 814 Third Ave., thusly: "In Prewar France a vistor overtaken by hunger
needed only to apply to the nearest small eatery-and-drinkery. Were it ever so humble, it would scare up a worth-shile meal for him. 
This Third Avenue spot was designed as a certified copy of a typical bistro. French owned spick-and-span. Should you need nutriment
and/or quenchment other than hard liquor, it has it for you, noons or evenings, tasting as of France." (p. 103)
According to an article published in the <i>New York Times</i> ("Parisian Milliner Leases Floor Here," <i>New York Times</i> December 10, 1941, 
p. 46), Le Bistro was established that year. Another <i>New York Times</i> article describes Le Moal as "a small restaurant at 811 Third
Avenue, near Fiftieth Street, but in an unpretentious way the place is typical of some little bistro in Brittany. Well-cooked food
and prices as modest as the decor are the attractions on which Mme. Frank Le Moal relies for  patronage--and with satisfactory
results."<br>---"News of Food: A Small Restaurant on Third Avenue is Typical of a Little Bistro on Brittany," <i>New York Times</i>,

True or false: Ancient Roman soldiers ate well. TRUE!!! In the context of period and place. Historians and archaeolgists agree Roman soldiers were well equipped and supplied with
the human fuel they needed to achieve their goals. Does this mean the Ancient Roman soldier enjoyed lavish meals & fine cuisine?
Certainly not. They did, however, have full government backing with regards to establishing supply chains, engaging in active
indigenous food acquisition practices and sampling local fare.
<p>
Then as today, rations were selected by cost, availability, portability, imperviousness to weather/rodents/insects,
 and cooking requirements. Then, as today, soldiers at base could expect fresh bread and regular meals while those engaged on march or in
camp made the best of the daily situation. Then, as today, some foods were exotically spectacular while others questionably edible.
<p>
"The Roman army had the best commissariat and arrangements for feeding in the ancient world. It was an important agent in transmitting the Roman way of life to
 the provinces, and in doing so it revolutionized the economy and provided new foods. Its demands caused native populations to increase food production from 
subsistence farming to an agriculture that produced surpluses. On the march, it was supplied with rations of wheat and other foods, and when established in the forts
 it could expect regular supplies. The army created a network of contacts and an efficient transport system and it constructed roads, which allowed goods to be 
moved quickly throughout the empire as well as locally from fort to fort and country to town. Standard food would consist of bread, bacon, cheese, vegetables, and
 the lowest quality of wine. For these commodities, a fixed amount was deducted from a soldier's pay. Emperor Hadrian followed the example of his troops and in 
camp ate the basic food of bacon, cheese, and sour wine. A soldier could supplement these rations by buying supplies elsewhere, bu the army also supplied extra 
food, incluing liquamen, salt, and olive oil. The last was more than a food, for it could be used to oil joints on armor, as a lubricant for the body, and for lighting. 
Special rations would be issued at festivals and other occasions. Nevertheless, a camp commandant had to make sure that sufficient supplies for fuel and food must
 be provided at all times...Bread was a basic commodity, fresh loaves provided daily in camps or forts. Unlike Greek soldiers, the Romans did not eat barley bread.
 To eat this was regarded as a disgrace...Meat--beef, pork, goat, and mutton--was provided by the commissariat or by hunting wild boar, deer, hare, and fowl...
Soldiers encamped near the seacoast included fish in their diet...Food could be supplemented in other ways. It might be bought from passing traders or from a shop
 in a vici that had been established around the camps...The variety of army diet is reveaed by the Vindolanda writing tablets. A list covering the payments and 
suppliers over a period of eight days in June sometime between A.D. 92 and A.D. 199 seems to have been part of a survey given as payment in kind to support the 
army in Egypt. The foods include wheat, lentils, cattle, calves, goats, pigs, hams, wine, and radish oil. This oil was a staple cooking oil in Egypt, and the soldiers 
must have adapted to its use...Archaeological evidence from military sites along the Rhine indicates the consumption of a variety of grains, pulses, vegetables, nuts, 
and fruit. The fort at Neuss, dated to the first century A.D., has revealed evidence of wheat, barley, wild oats (probably used as fodder), eggs, meat, oyster, broad
 beans, lentils, garlic, grapes, elderberries, and hazelnuts. In addition, there are four food that must have been introduced to the area by the army--rice, chickpeas,
 olives, and figs. Barrels, which had contained imported wine, were found. At Dura-Europus, on the Euphrates, papyrus records show soldiers engaged in tasks of 
collecting, purchasing, and escorting supplies of corn (grain, not maize), food barley, and speical supplies for banqueting."<br>

"Patera. Another peice of kit that no legionary will voluntarily go without is his patera. This is an all purpose cup, cooking pot and food bowl. The best ones have a 
diameter of about 7 in., and are made from bronze, sometimes lined inside with tin, and have grooves ground into them to help conduct heat during cooking...a 
heavy patera is more solid, and lasts longer, but weight is always a disadvantage on the march."<br>

<p>

"Water flask. The water flask represents another such choice. A little-known attribute of water is that it is astonishingly heavy Therefore a soldier must choose 
between carrying several pounds of water (depending on location) or risk the deprivations of thirst. In some regions, gourds, hollowed out and sealed with a wax
 stopper, make excellent lightweight water bottles. It is impossible to fix handles to these, but it is easly enough to fashion a net around the gourd and carry it on a 
sling."<br>
---<i>ibid</i> (p. 67)

<p>
"Rations. To this one should add several days' supply of food (including buccellatum, a kind of hard tack."<br>
---<i>ibid</i> (p. 67)

<p>
"Breakfast. Begin the day with a light meal (probably of cold meat and cheese) prepared under the watchful eye of a military tribune. He has the job of making sure
 that the food given to the legionaries is of an adequate standard. (it is not unknown for the suppliers to use bribrey to pass off sub-standard rations, and it is the
 tribune's job to prevent this."<br>
---<i>ibid</i> (p. 122)

<p>
"Dinner. While most of the troops are on their duties, others are helping to prepare the late afternoon meal which is the legionary's main sustenance of the day. In 
some areas, one of the better and most exciting fatigue exercises of the day is to be assigned to a hunting prty to bring fresh game--venison or boar--to the mess 
tables of one's fellow soldiers. By and large legionaries in base ae among the better-fed citizens of the empire, and depending on the nationality of the majority of his
 legionaries, the commander will take care to supply the men with items such as wine and the piquant (or reeking, depending on taste) garum fish sauce--beloved of
 Italians, but needing long-distant transport. Meat, cheese, bread and beer are all staples of the legionary diet. Pork is the most common type of meat, though what 
you get will depend on what is available locally."<br>
---<i>ibid</i> (p. 124)
<p>
"Campaign rations. One major difference between a marching camp and permanent base is the lack of kitchen facilities. The logistical issue is something that has also
 occurred to those trying to stop the legins invading them. While the legion itself may be invincible, its supply lines are not, and no army operates at its best while the
 soldiers are starving...It is in case an ambush on the supply trains is successful that the legionary carries up to a week's supply of food in his pack. This is apart from
 the dreaded hard tack which remains once the legionary has explored the possibilities offered by his boots and shield cover as alternative diet options. In the field 
the conontubernium has to feed itself. Food comes from two sources.
The Comissariat. Perhaps one of the most distinctive features of a Roman army in the field is how much effort has been made to ensure tht food supplies are 
available for the army as it progresses. Stockpiles. The general in charge will have ensured that before te first legionary sets a toe over the provincial border to 
enemy territory, huge stockpiles of grain and meat have been laide by to feed him all the way to his destination. Food on the march. As the philosophical 
quartermaster will tell you, the true purpose of lifeis to keep meat fresh. Therefore he might lay on a herd of cattle to follow the legion, providing a supply of food
 that transports itself, stays fresh, and also provides a handy source of rawhide, sinew ad glue. Packed meals. The legion mainly supplies the men with grain and 
cured meat. The grain is ground in hand mills that are carried on the mule of the contubernium, and can be baked into crude cakes, or ito a mela resembling thick
 porridge. A lazy troop, or one with a lot on its plate...might simply boil the grain and eat that. Forage parties. Such a diet becomes monotonous after a very short
 time, and marching and digging for the greater part of each day definitely stimulates the appetite. Therefore the addition of fresh beef, pork or mutton, or an
 unexpected dollop of vegetable fare, is extremely welcome. This food comes form the land the army is passing through...So this is there the auxiliaries earn their 
keep, as they work in forage parties, seeking out where the villagers have stashed their herds and bringing them back to camp to provide the soldiers with fresh
 meat. Other parties spread out from the line of march pillaging orchards and farmlands and coming back with fresh fruit and vegetables...This is one of the reasons
 why the summer and early autumnare called the 'campaigning season'--because the countryside holds enough food to keep an army in the field."<br>
---<i>ibid</i> (p. 145-147)
<p>
"Besides his arms and armor, the legionary was accustomed to carry...articles for obtaining and cooking food, such a sickles, cords, and cooking vessels...The 
ration of food for one day weighed probably about 1 2/3 lbs. On short expeditions, the soldier must carry his own provisions. As many as 17 days'rations, 
amounting to 28 lbs., are known to have been provided and carried. The ration was usually in the form of coarse flour, or of unground grain which the soldier must 
crush for himself. According as the food was for a longer or shorter time, the weight carried, exclusive of arms and armor, must have reached 30 to 45 lbs...Caesar
 fixed the pay of his legionaries at 225 denarii a year. ...For food and equipments, so far as they were provided by the state, a deduction from his pay was made. As
 provision, each man was allowed per month four measures (8.67 litres, or a little less than a peck) of wheat. The measure may be estimated to be worth at the 
highest three-fourths of a denarius. Thus the amount deducted for food cannot have exceeded 36 denarii per year. However, in the provinces, the food, if not given
 outright, was reckoned at a very lowprice."<br>

Historians confirm Roman legionaries consumed local commodities and foods of "hosting" nations. They also learned new cooking techniques, adopting/adapting as they saw fit. Most of the English language food history sources for "eastern"" cuisine chronicle medieval period forwards. Two sources that might be of interest to you are Turkish Cuisine in Historical Perspective/Deniz Gursoy and The Oldest Cuisine in the World: Cooking in Mesopotamia/Jean Bottero. Your local public librarian will be happy to get you copies. Also recommended (for authenticating period foodstuffs): Food in Antiquity: A Survey of the Diet of Early Peoples/Brothwell & Brothwell and Food in the Ancient World form A to Z/Dalby.

<center><font size="5" color="#003366"><b>Food trucks</b></font></center><br>
Contemporary American Food Trucks (aka Hot Trucks & Mobile Food Preparation Units), akin to pop-up restaurants where food is cooked & served aboard a vehicle, 
descend from early mobile military feeding units. As the industrial revolution happened, workers looked for closer
dining alternatives. Enter: diners, penny restaurants, canteens & pushcarts. Through the years, the term "food truck" also meant food that was transported from
farm to manufacturer, manufacturer to shop/dining venue, and edible supplies sent to relieve hunger. In the 20th century, Canteens (Cold Trucks), bringing prepackaged
 food (& sometimes hot coffee) to workers in factories an other industrial sites, were welcome by bosses who viewed them as efficient. 
<p>
Our research indicates Food Trucks burst on the American scene in the 1970s. The original venue was southern California. Unwelcome by the cold-prepackaged food 
purveyors and restaurants, Hot Trucks were perceived as a health, safety and economic threat to their environs. Much like the late 19th century pushcarts. 
Gourmet Food Trucks sprang on the scene in the early 2000s.

truck which parks in front of a nearby Lockheed fatory. [The complainant] was particularly unhappy that the truck has cooking facilities to prepare hot food on orer and
'The catering trucks do not supply jobs to others at the rate I do nor pay the taxes nor the rent my restaurant does.'...'We have about 80 licensed catering trucks in
the city, incuding two that have cooking facilities and put out hot food--hamburgers, cheeseburgers--on order. They are permitted to park at te curb so long as no
parkig violation occurs. At the present time a $25 to $36 annual license is charged for each truck with an additional $36 if it also sells ice cream.' McKenzie (a City
Councilman) suggested 'Perhaps these cooking-type trucks should hae more restrictive regulations To me this is unfair competition I think the trucks that can cook
and serve food on order are the coming thing and will be a bigger problem...Legal competition...becomes unfair when you make it illegal. The rights of the individuals
who use the truck or restaurant were never considered. It is the choice of the person where he wants to spend his dollar.'"<br>

prohibiting these itinerant restaurants are repealed in San Diego County and incorporated cities, the 156 canteen trucks now operating in San Diego, and selling hot
prepackaged foods, probably will be converted to cook-aboard vehicles. Also, and additional 60 to 110 food preparation vehicles are anticipated to commence operation

"Starting in Los Angeles County in the 1960s, hot trucks gradually expanded throughout the Southland, taking business away from the camper-like cold trucks where 
entrees are limited to the prepackaged sandwiches. 'They spread like a prairie fire,' recalled Al Ely, general manager of Orange County Food Serevice Inc. The reason?
'A hot sandwich always tastes better than a cold one,' explained Joe Merio executive directore of the Industrial Caterers Assn., which represents 2,000 hot and cold
trucks between Los Angeles and San Diego. Ely and Merio have more than a passing interest in the hot truck's growing popularity. Ely's company already has invested $2 million
 in the trucks, which at $20,000 apiece cost twice as much as cold trucks. One-third of the members of Merio's association are hot truck operators. Yet both men are
outspoken in their denunciation of hot trucks...Ely has been telling Orange County officials for eight months that his own company's trucks are unsafe for workers and
unsanitary for customers...'We had such a nice operation until the hot trucks came along,' Ely said. 'We refused to make the transition for a long time..." In the last
five years, Orange County Food Service suffered between 50 and 100 cancellations of service because of plants' demands for hot trucks...forced into the hot
truck business--[Ely's] company is now buying two such vehicles a month...[Ely] candidly concedes that he's been urging Orang County officials to ban hot trucks--and that
his firm probably would regain its market share of such a ban was enacted...Meanwhile, the catering companies are adding more and more hot trucks--each can serve up to
1,5000 people a day--to meet the increasing demand. 'People just want a freshly made sandwich,' said Louis Akoboff, co-owner of Road Runner Hot Lunch in Santa Ana, who
claimed his firm's 60 hot trucks had fewer sanitary violations than cold trucks. Akobff said that even a group of county sanitarians who visited one of his trucks last
week couldn't resist the llure of sandwiches right off the grill. 'They just raved about the food,'..."<br>

"There are 80 hot food truck operators who daily shop the commissary [in Los Angeles County, a huge warehouse-grocery store, inspected by the County] for meat, fruit and vegetables to refill the larder emptied from

construction site three blocks away was a 10-minute stop...The test of the day is lunchtime...Despite the patronaage, 'I don't think we're held in high regard.'...The 
hot trucks--offering a menu with as many as 86 items, most cooked on the truck which typically has a sink, deep fry, freezer, refrigerator, grill, oven and 
two coffee urns--are Johnnie-come-lately alternatives to the one-person cold truck which sells ready-made sandwiches and is blamed for the harsh nick-name of 'roach
coach.' Many of the fast food hot trucks are cleaning up financially--some drivers say they clear as much as $200 a day...The key to a good hot truck business...is the
cook who earns about $200 a week preparing, cooking and serving...On Friday, many of the drivers give [the cooks] the unsold food that otherwise would be discarded...
Although there seems to be a general agreement among drivers against 'route crashing,' the practice of selling food on another driver's route, there is almost daily
pressure from someone who wants some of the action on a good-paying route."<br>

began lining the streets here, all eight vendors stayed open at all hours. Since then, they have agreed among themselves to divide the hours, agree on prices and

From the beginning of time, there were travelers. Eventually, these travelers got hungry and had to eat. Enter on-site
foodservice. Ancient Roman soldiers, Medieval crusaders, Renaissance explorers, colonial traders, and 19th century 
railroad passengers were fed by enterprising mobile entrepreneurs who capitalized on captive markets. Inflight catering 
descends from this tradition.
<p>
Like passenger railroads and cruise lines, the first commercial airlines catered specifically to wealthier classes. These
customers demanded the finest service and were willing to pay the price. En-route meals served two purposes:
stay the hunger and pass the time. <a href="restaurants.html#railroad">Railroad moguls</a> starting thinking about passenger food from the 
beginning. So did the airline companies. As techology advanced, so did the catering possibilities. Inflight catering presented
a unique set of challenges for the cooks and crew serving the food. In the early years, on-site kitchen full-service facilities were not possible, 
as they had been on railroads. <a href="restaurants.html#blimps">Blimps</a> featured luxurious meals. 
Pioneering <a href="restaurants.html#aviators">solo aviators/aviatrix</a> [Wright brothers, Lindbergh, Earhart, Markham] consumed meagre rations by personal choice..
Which airline was the first to offer inflight catering? Both 
United and American claim this distinction.
<p>
<b>Early commercial foodservice</b><br>
"The first airlines were created after World War I by former military pilots. Their purpose was mail delivery, not passenger 
transport. Passengers were gradually included on flights...Since passengers were considered an necessary evil by the pilots who ran
...the airlines, no thought was given to any foodservice for them, although the pilots and other members of the crew might sometimes share
a box lunch sandwich or a thermos of coffee with them. It was not until 1936, with the development of the DC-3, that the first
airplane galley was introduced by American Airlines. That galley was quite primitive by modern standards as there was no
electrical power available for heating foods or beverages, and all hot foods and liquids were boarded at ready-to-serve temperatures
and held in hot thermoses. Three years later, the Boeing 307 Stratoliner, the first aircraft with a pressurized cabin that
permitted commercial flights above the weather, was developed with a galley no more advanced than that of the DC-3. Primitive
though it was, the DC-3...revolutionized air travel in the United States, and it was in this plane that routine, planned
passenger foodservice became the standard for the industry...Also in the 1930s, Pan American Airways developed extensive
galleys on their flying boats. The clippers that were used for overseas flights. Although there was no electric power available
for these galleys for either heating or cooling food products, the last of these famous aircraft, the Boeing 314, had food-heating 
capability from a glycol circulating system which piped glycol from the galley to one of the plane's four engines. The engine
heated the glycol, which, in turn, heated water in the galley...from the very first, these flying clippers had the capability
of making fresh coffee on board...There was no refrigeration system on board these flying clippers, and weight limitations precluded
boarding more than the minimum amount of ice that was needed for bar service requirements. However, because of the poor
reliability of the glycol heating system, cold meals or cold buffets were served on these flights whenever climatic conditions
allowed. Except in places such as wake Island, where there were no ammenities available and Pan American had had to establish
and staff kitchens, food for the clipper flights was procured from high-quality local hotels or restaurants. The finest foods
were procured as Pan American was competing with the elegant steamships of the day for their passengers. However, canned foods,'
such as ham, potatoes, peas, and so on were always carried on board for emergency purposes and for second meals that were required
on long flights...By the mid-1930s, airlines were beginning to realize the importance of inflight foodservices and were 
becoming concerned about both the quality of the food products available and the high prices charged by the airport
terminal restaurants wehre they usually bought their food supplies. United Airlines...was the first airline to recognize the 
marketing potential of inflight foodservice as the competition of airlines increased...[a consultant] developed United's
answer to the problem--build its own flight kitchens at airports where its flights landed. The first experimental kitchen
was completed in Oakland, California in December 1934. Operating its own kitchen was so successful for United...United eventually
built a chain of twenty kitchens throughout the United States..."<br>

<b>Pioneering caterers</b><br>
"Marriott was one of the earliest inflight caterers as a result of innovative actions by William Kahrl, the manager of a new
Marriott Hot Shoppe across the road from Washington's Hoover Airport (now Washington National Airport) in the late 1930s. In late 1937, at 
th request of one of his customers who was the manager of American Airlines' operations there at that time, Kahrl started 
putting coffee and sweet rolls on American flights coming from the West Coast...The airline furnished the thermoses; the Hot Shoppe
furnished the food and paper supplies; everything as loaded on a flat pushcart and pushed across Route 1 from the Hot Shoppe to the 
airport in the very early morning hours and loaded onto the airplane...Dobbs' entry into the inflight foodservice field was
in response to James K. Dobbs' concern with the poor-quality food that he received on flights as he traveled around the country
checking on his Toddle House operations. He enjoyed quality food, and felt that airline passengers were entitled to the best
food possible...His work was instrumental in the airlines' transition from serving only cold box lunches to serving hot, 
restaurant-style meals...Mr. Dobbs' concept was to service the airlines through the terminal restaurants. He also had a theory
that there should be a recipe for everything, and he demanded that all the products in all these restaurants be prepared
by approved recipes. Thus, Dobbs was able to provide consistent food products from one airport to the next."<br>

<b>[1938] Gourmet standards</b><br>
"Just before you step aboard one of the bright-winged planes that is to carry you along the sky route North, South, or West, from the
airport at Newark, New Jersey, a meal will be stowed in the plane's compact kitchen. Mrs.G. Thomas French is an authority on air-bred
appetites. For the past six and a half years she has been preparing, or supervising the preparation of, breakfasts, lunches, dinners,
and in-between meals, to satisfy America's hunger on the wing. She began the service for one of the lines but very soon thereafter was
asked to cater also for the other three at the Newark terminus. It takes rather a large staff and a very efficiently directed
kitchen to supply food for several meals a day, to four airlines, each with its own timetable. Mrs. French's husband and her mother 
both have an active part in the business. There are ten girls in the kitchen (including two cooks), and six boys who help with the
commissary work. There is also a baker who takes possession of the kitchen after the day-force leaves, and works there alone all
night. "Except for the sandwich bread, we do all our own baking--pies, tarts, pastries, creamroll desserts, breads, and 
muffins." She pointed to the day's supply--orange bread, date-and-nut bread, and rolled cinnamon bread, all very delicious...OM airplane
service special features...are particularly important. "And we also make a gerat deal of our salads,"..."They constitute a part of 
the meal that you can dress up to look particularly attractive."...a first-class salad can transform a commonplace meal or, served
right along with the main course, can make yesterday' roast seem an inspiration of genius. Only--don't make your salad of left-overs.
Use those somewhere else...Not to be repetitious in the matter of main dishes is just as important on a plane as it is at
home. Here Mrs. French is guided by the commuters. "We get to know them," she explains, "and to expect them regularly on the same
days. So we are careful not to plan the same dish for successive Mondays--or whatever the day may be." Yet the fact that the food must
be cooked in advance and kept palatable until it is served makes a real problem. This is a difficulty, however, that Mrs. Frwench 
considers a challenge. The roast meats--turkey, beef, or lamb, for example--are the simplest to plan. Beef-steak-and-mushroom pie
is also good. Moreover it is a noble suggestion for the family at home--not expensive and not spoiled if you have to keep dinner
waiting for a late homecomer or a dilatory guest. Baked stuffed lamb chops are also very delicious and they bear up well under 
delay."<br>

"Food by the mile! That's the result of the advancement of transportation. Fifteen miles for tomato bisque, 100 miles for fried chicken,
15 miles for the salad, 20 miles for the dessert, and 10 miles for your coffee. That is the way a 160-mile dinner in the air may be
eaten. It hasn't been so many years since cheese and ham sandwiches were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner to air passengers
by the co-pilot. But that type of service disappeared along with the single-motored transports--now delicious, nutritious meals, "jsut
like mother cooks," are regularly a part of air service. It's fun to watch the stewardesses serve 21 dinners from her kitchenette
 in less than an hour, as you skim past gorgeous scenery, and soft, billowy clouds. The dinners that are seved in the air are complete from
soup to nuts, including a large variety of food. The menus are carefully chosen--balanced and nutritious--with the idea of pleasing
most of the people most of the time. Food is not cooked on board, but kept hot by using thermos jugs and bottles. All food is cooked and
supervised at the airport commissaries. Some of these commissaries are owned and operated by the airlines, others are operated
by food caterers. On every ship's departure from the airport along goes some kind of food, all the way from hot coffee, light and heavy
breakfasts to fill dinners. Then there is the snack box for the in-betweeners. The stewardess can soon assemble a delightful lunch from
it--cold chicken, fancy cheese, olives, crackers, cookies--anything to hit the spot, with milk, hot chocolate and coffee. And deveryting is on
the house. When the Post Food Editor delved into "sky eating" she learned there were several favorite foods of air-passengers. One of these
is Southern fried chicken. Ice cream leads in airway desserts."<br>

<b>[1945] Jet travel & frozen foods</b><br>
"Then, around 1945, Pan
American worked together with Clarence Birdseye and Maxson Company to create the
convection oven, which would allow frozen foods to be heated on board the aircraft.
Maxson called the first convection oven it designed the Whirlwind Oven: it had a heating
element in the fort of a fan and held six meals. Soon afterward, the microwave oven was
developed; it has since become the industry standard in aircraft food service preparation.
The first meal trays were served on pillows on passengers' laps, until trays have been
developed with lids that would serve to elevate the food in front of the passengers.
Finally, foldout service trays were installed in the seat backs. The three-course meal that
has become the standard for airplane food trays grew out of the creation by United
Airlines in 1937 of the first functional airplane kitchen, conceived in an effort to improve
the quality of food offered during flight...The first successful frozen three-course meal
fitting the tray's specifications--consisting of meat, potatoes, and vegetables--was
marketed by the Maxson Company; the meals were sold to Pan American Airways in
1946." <br>

"Although there has been some talk recently by airline heads of ending the custom of free meals on skyliners, catering for air
travelers is still a bustling branch of the aviation business at Logan International Airport. Those tasty meals you eat on flights 
from Boston to points around the world have become so much a part of flying--an anticipated treat by travelers taking the air
route--that airline heads here see little danger of aeronauts having to bring along their own victuals for a sky hop anytime in the
near future. Hundreds of meals, ranging from short snacks for "short hoppers" to full course meals for overseas and transcontent
trips, are prepared by three catering houses at Boston's big air terminal. At Sky Chefs, Boston unit of a nation-wide chain of airline
caterers, cooks, salad makers and bakers work almost around-the-clock to provide meals on some 50 flights a day...the Sky Chefs staff
starts to work at midnight to prepare meals for "breakfast flights" that leave Logan Airport between 6 and 8 a.m. The type of meal 
served on thes flights depends upon the length of the trip...the free meal is considered part of the travel ticket...Typical breakfast
on a hour hop from Boston to New York offers fresh fruit, sweet rolls, hot drinks or milk, but there's more substantial fare for the
morning traveler who soars off for far points. Long trip breakfasts also include scrambled eggs and ham. Dinner on a long flight
like a jaunt from Boston to London includes soup, olives and celery, filet mignon, fried chicken, or pork chops, vegetables and salad, hot rolls,
hot drinks or milk. Hard part of airline catering is timing the food preparation so the meals will be hot and tasty when the
stewardess rings the dinner bell aloft. This is accomplished at Sky Chefs by first cooking the foood as short a time as
possible before the flights leave; then placing the cooked meals in an electric oven till plane time, when the food is rushed to the
skyliner and given more electric heating at the same voltage used in the kitchen. As a result, sky meals do not suffer from being
dry, mushy, lukewarm or cold...Fogs and bad weather in the winter often "upset" the skyline caterer when planes remain grounded
and the food is unused...The caterer works on a deadline like a newspaper man, too, for planes don't wait for tardy cooks and the 
caterer's men must stow their food aboard the liner 15 minutes before it leaves...Food taken off a plane is never used again and the 
Sky Chef's staff of 18 often take home tasty steaks and pastries that were cooked up for a flight which didn't go up. Faster airline speeds,
incidentally, are greatly complicating the caterer's problems. Where there was formerly time to serve a meal betwen New YOrk and Boston, it's 
about all a stewardess can do now is just hand around cookies and a beverage."<br>

<b>[1950s] Technology marches on...</b> <br>
"The development of jet aircraft in the 1950s began a new era in inflight foodservice. Not only were the galleys in the
aircraft newly designed, but changes were required in the inflight kitchens...The end result was a near doubling in 
size of inflight kitchens...In the early 1950s, hot food packaging was changed from the thermoses...to heated ovens...
Throughout this period, Pan American Airways continued its development of elegant service for its transoceanic flights. An innovation
developed by Bert Snowden was the precooked frozen entree, the forerunner of today's  pop-out meals. Its development of the 
convection oven in 1945 (termed the Maxson Oven...) led to Pan American's increased usage of these frozen meals...
The new precooked frozen entree was  flexible item that could be used in any system. In addition to being heated on board planes
equipped with the new convection oven, it could also be thawed, heated on the ground, and boarded as a hot casserole meal...
the precooked frozen entree was very controversial. Many chefs felt  that it posed a threat to their security. Also...
many of the early products that appeared on the market were of inferior quality and gave the system a bad reputation...These concersn
with meal quality caused Pan American to seriously consider eliminating this frozen meal concept in 1948. However, to revert to 
locally prepared meals at that time would have meant the development of flight kitchens in such areas as Damascus, Suyria; New
Delhi and Calcutta, India; Bangkok, Thailand; and Johannesburg, South Africa. At the same time, they were in need of new
aircracraft to expand their fleet; so funding and development of inflight kitchens in these rather remote areas was not
economically feasible....the problem was not the system, but the quality of food products being prepared for the system...[Kenneth 
Parratt] installed equipment such as high-velocity blast freezers and low-temperature storage freezers...Products produced in this
faciltiy were shipped around the world to the Pan American commissaries...TWA was also producing frozen entrees at its 
flight kitchens at Orly Field in Paris and at Laguardia Airport in New York City...The 1950s was also the era for the 
development of many standardized products suitable for use in inflight foodservices...The boarding of glass carbonated 
beverages bottles had been a major problem...The new cans were not only lighter and disposable, but their flexibility helped
alleviate the explosion problem...The advent of the 707 jet aircracraft brought fine restaurant dining to first-class passengers
in the late 1960s. Efforts were made to adapt menus from well-known fine dining establishments to airline sevice...Pan
American['s]...partner was Maximes of Paris."<br>

<b>[1951] Stewardess career guide describes food service protocol to prospective employees</b><br>
"Dining service. One of the miracles of our modern flights is the airborne meal. What was once a haphazard system of supplying a few sandwiches and coffee to air
 travelers, has now developed into a feat of engineering and planning to rival the most complex chemical formula.. In 1950, approximately fifteen million meals were
 prepared and served by the major airlines! Dining Service, one of the important divisions of Passenger Service, has truly found its permanent place in modern air 
transportation, and is now an accepted part of every scheduled airline flight. 
<p>

The operation of Dining Service is usually undertaken by the airline itself or by an outside agency such as Sky Chefs, Inc. For the airline that maintains its own flight 
kitchens, the serving of thousands of meals and snacks a day is an endless responsibility. But, with the detailed and advanced planning which has become an integral 
part of this service, this operation runs smoothly and efficinetly. Considering the fact that most flights make only a few stops on coast-to-coast runs, and that these 
stops are only from fifteen to thirty minutes, this business of keeping up with the air traveler's appetite is quite a problem. On a flight from San Francisco to New 
York, for instance, with one stop at Omaha, let's see what happens to the food situation. If the flight left at 6:00 p.M. PST, the passengers received a hot full-course
 dinner about one hour out of San Francisco. Upon arriving at Omaha at 1:35 A.M. CST, while these same passengers were comfortably dozing, the dinner meal 
service and used trays were quickly whisked off and a hot full-course breakfast was placed on board. now it stands to reason that no person wants to sit down to
 breakfast at the unholy jour of 2:00 A.M., even on an airline flight! So the food was packed in thermal heating units, for use during the usual breakfast period. 
Leaving Omaha at 2:05 A.M., the stewardess turned on the heating unit, and promptly ignored the fifty-off individual meals for a few hours. At 7 A.M. EST, she 
nonchalantly set up her buffet, an, now east of Cleveland, awakened her passengers to a still piping hot meal of ham and eggs! Black magic? No, just the result of the
 combined efforts of the Engineering and Dining Service divisions of the airline.
<p>

Each flight kitchen of an airline has been placed in charge of a competent manager and chef. the chef orderes supplies for meals days in advance, and plans the 
menus to be served from his own kitchen. Once a week he submits the advance menus to the home base of the airline for correlation, so that a passenger on a 
coast-to-caost flight will not be served steak three times in a row!

The menus submitted are also checked for digestibility and appeal. They are well balanced, and provide the proper ratio of proteins and vitamins. Certaian foods 
are 'taboo' on an airline menu. For instance, according to most of the airlines, highly spiced foods and foreign dishes are not universally acceptable. Where the 
airline carries every possible type of traveler, a generally acceptable dish is mandatory. Even that old stand-by, bread, comes in for consideration on an airline 
menu. Breads which have a high moisture content are generally preferred, such as rye or raisin. Cookies are served instead of cake. Cake sometimes collapses at 
certain heights, because of pressure changes due to altitude! Sandwiches are not too frequently seen nowadays, because of their tendency to dry out. With all these
 factors to consider, it is to the great credit of the airlines that the airline meal is not only well balanced and varied, but has received the acclaim of hundreds of 
thousands of happy air travelers.
<p>

Working along with the chef, in these airline kitchens, are many assistant chefs, second cooks, pastry cooks, bakery and pantry workers and other skilled helpers...
The meals are planned with the assistance of a trained dietician, who with the chief chef decides upon the menus about five weeks in advance of a scheduled flight! 
The number of meals is important, also. It is difficult to plan, down to the last passenger, just how much food will be needed in five weeks...

Shortly before departure time, all the hot foods for the flight are prepared. Portions of meat, potato, and vegetable are placed in individual casseroles. The casseroles 
are then garnished, covered with lids, and placed in pre-heated insualted hot boxes, or in thermostatically controlled, electrically heated cartons. The boxes are later
 plugged into the wired circuits in the buffet of the plane. Salads, desserts, and rolls are all prepared and placed in containers on the tray beforehand, thus facilitating 
the work of the stewardess when she serves the meal. Iced desserts and staples, such as butter and cream, which need refrigeration, are packed in insulated 
cartons. Dry ice is used as the refrigerant. Every item whcih can be tray-packed is done in the flight kitchen, to save time during the flight. As the trays are 
completed and packed in larger carriers, they are checked off by a kitchen steward. Once released by the airline kitchen, the trays and supplies are turned over to 
the Supply Service division of the airline for loading on the airplane...
<p>

"Now the stewardess comes into the picture. At mealtime, she has only to set up the buffet, remove the lids from the food containers, place the hot and cold foods 
and beverage in their proper places, put the silver, napkin and souvenir menu on the tray, and serve it to the waiting passenger. Each passenger is individually
 served. Some types of airplanes now have individiual tables which are used during mealtine. Others use the passenger's pillow as the serving table. 

With the smoothy working assistance of the Dining Division and the Supply Department of an airline, the airline stewardess has gained the enviable reputation of 
being the finest hostess in the world."<br>

"I have just discovered one of the world's really spectacular restaurants. Sort of out of this world. Well, almost, that is. It's
an intimate little place operated by Trans World Arilines at about 35,000 ft. over the Atlantic. There's just one drawback, thoug:
Passengers become so spoiled by the food and serve that occasionally someone refuses to deplane when the jet lands. ..let me tell
you about TWA's Royal Ambassador service...First off, TWA found out it was my birthday and insisted on throwing a party 
(the reservations clerks check every passenger's passport for this very reason). The stewardess brought a vanila-frosted two-layer cake that
spelled out "Best Wishes."...As the movie ended the three stewardesses and steward in the first class section began serving a feast
unseen since the Beverly Hills Food & Wine Society banded toghether last. Before leaving Los Angeles everyone was given a booklet
which explained: "A Royal Ambassador meal is a series of impressions...the soft clink of cocktail glasses...the crisp, frosty
tang of expertly mixed dirnks...tasty snacks..." There was a great deal of clinking all right; the beverage list alone
contained 36 drinks. At any rate, the booklet explained that this was merely the beginning--just a warm-up for dishes to come, such as
Beluga caviar, smoked Nova Scotia salmon and fresh lobster medallion. Among other selections were just about anything you can
name from chateaubriands to hot dogs and hamburgers. They even served malts to those who asked for them. The list contained so many
selections this column would run overtime telling about them. But just to name a few: Le Canard a L'Orange Au Grand Mariner, or 
duckling with orange sauce; Les Filets de Sole Ambassadeur--meaning filet of sole with truffles and mushrooms. Sirlion
steak, roast filet of beef, double thick lamb chops, etc. As for the salad, it was composed of hearts of palm imported from Argentina.
Dawn was breaking as the meal ended. Through a rent in the clouds I caught a glimpse of the River Seine twisting through 
Paris. It was like coming home. Vive le TWA!"<br>

served--for two hours and a thousand miles. (Why, on the way from New York to Honolulu, you can have have three breakfasts, and
no one blinks an eye!"<br>

<p>
"Just how are the airlines going to serve meals in the supersonic age? Probably just about the way way they do today on relatively 
short flights--though some ingenious planning that would make an efficiency expert go back to school. The airlines that will operate 
supersonic airliners liteterally are getting ideas from carriers whose average route covers 1,000 miles or less. The so-called regional
trunk carriers, like Eastern and Western, already have developled cabin service procedure which even tually may become 
supersonic procedures. Richard P. Ensign, director of in-flight sevices for Western Airlines, bound out 10 years oago what serving meals at 
2,000 mile and hour might involve...Western in 1954 introduced 'champagne flights' on its system, including the Los Angles-San
Francisco route. It quickly discovered a fly in the champagne. The bubbly beverages, gourmet meals and after-dinner drinks took an hour
and 50 minutes to serve--14 minutes longer than the flying time between Los Angeels and San Francisco. Ensign was put in charge of a task force
to figure out how to save time without lowering serving service standards. He flew up and down Western's system, watching stewardesses
 at work and noticing wehre a few seconds might be saved. One economy: open one-third of the champagen bottles before takeoff, a gimmick that saved eight minutes. 
Another: put all tray tables into place on one trip down the aisle and table napkins in place on a second trip. The biggest saving 
resulted from changing the procedure for pouring the champagne. TThe stewardesses had been putting it into glasses on a big tray juggling
it down the aisle and handing each filled glass to a passenter. Ensign instead had the girls put empty glasses on the individual
east tray and pour the champagne as they moved through the cabin. Those few steps saved more than 15 minutes. Ten along came the jet age.
Western found that its average flight provided only 50 minutes for a meal service--figuing out less than 30 seconds per passenger. Pre-packed
meals were an obvious necessity, but this didn't help too much. Ensign then did time and motion studies which revealed that the big
bottleneck was the time consumed in picking up trays, and emptying and storing glasses. Western's 'fix' was simple. It began using 
disposable plastic glases and snack trays. Along with a special cart which stewardesses just rolled down the aisl for the glass and tray
collection. A plastic glass costs only two cents, considerably less than what it costs an airline to buy real glassware and sanitize it after every
use. Western's next problem was gettin gcoach passengers to eat faster, inasmuch as even snack service in those fcrowded 
sections took too much time. The answer was a decision to eliminate any foods that had to be cut with a knife. Ensign came up with 
snacks that could be eaten with the fingers and which required little chewing--club sandwihces, deviled eggs. The
stewardesses themselves have given Western a lot of ideas on better cabin service. regular 'let down your hair' meetings are held between the 
girls and company officials. After one such meeting, Ensign put into effect no less than 177 changes in serve procedures."<br>

<b>[1977] Class differentials</b><br>
"Sipping sake in happi coats as you wing your way toward the Far East...Butterscotch sundaes, hoagies, and deli buffets at 30,000 feet. A
rack of lamb, skewers of barbecued pork done Polynesian style. Salads with poi dressing served in orchid-clad monkeypots...Hoisting
up a few pub style in the clouds as you munch on pretzels and watch a gem of Pong...Beautifully illustrated, glossy menus boasting
both unusual and familiar fare. Long wine lists and numerous liqueurs...As one radio commercial proclaimed about a flight to
the Orient, "You will dine on lobster, caviar, and exotic cuisine based on authentic, ancient recipes...You are our honored guest." And one
might ad, a captive one. The food gimmicks are many. The airlines will do just about anything to lure you aboard their planes. 
And food is one of their major bargaining agents. Most airline food service personnel would agree that "the selling of an airline"
depends largely upon what goes into the mouths of its passeners. But let's face it, airline food is far from being a gastronomic
experience. An experience at times, yes, but not necessarily a gastronomic one. Several reasons for this are cited by the airline
caterers themselves. The time factor, costs, and the cramped quarters and galleys on even the large, wide-body jets limit the 
possibilities of an airline ever being able to compete with the fare served aboard a cruise ship, in a fine restaurant, or
even the luxury dining cars of trains past. From the caterer's viewpoint, the main purpose of an airline food service is "to serve
a good, wholesome, nutritionally balanced meal and be innovative about it...And what makes a "good" airline meal? According to
Juegen Brinker, regional vice president of Sky Chefs, a  wholly owned subsidiary of American Airlines, it's one that has eye appeal, that
is substantial enough to fit the time of day it's being served, and one that's being presented in a manner to be palatable and
enjoyable within the restriction of the airlines. As Michel J. Dick, international account manager for Marriot's In-Flite
Services at O'Hare, said "You start to eat with your eyes." Unfortunately, though, it's your stomach, and not your eyes, that 
makes the final judgement. So who's to blame for a that wilted salad, cold dinner roll, burnt peas, soggy desert, or tough piece
of mystery meat drenched in a sauce that resembles Gravy Train? The obvious answer would be the chef, of course. But with the 
airlines themselves "dictating" the menus and setting up very rigid guidelines the role of the chef in airline catering is quite
different from that of his counterpart in the restaurant business...."Passengers expect too much,"...With air fares what they are,
however, the passenger is inclined to disagree...Looking at it economically, there is more money set aside by an airline for a
first-class meal than a coach one, which, of course, results in a more elaborate service. But "in terms of quality, a coach passenger
is not treated as a second class citizen," said R.J. Henely, manager of Continentals' flight kitchen at O'Hare. If you are dining first class
rather than coach, these will be the differences: larger portion sizes, more courses, more choices of entrees and other items,
higher priced cuts of meat, fancier salads and deserts, and free cocktails along with a greater selection or wines and liqueurs.
The meal's presentation is different, also, such as china versus plastic and linen opposed to paper..."<br>

As airships transformed from military to commercial use, meals improved. Catering to the wealthiest classes of society (early passengers were accustomed to premier dining facilities provided by cruise liners) while juggling physical *lighter than air* requirements (food weights, kitchen facilities, dining room design) must have taxed even the most creative minds to the max.

"Sausage meat, more tightly compressed into the casings than ever before attempted, will form the main ration of the German crew which takes the American Navy dirigible ZR-3 across the Atlantic to Lakehurst, N.J. Specially prepared concentrated foods will make up the rest of the menu. For the Americans on board the aircraft there will be some canned meats, but they will have at least one sausage ration 
daily. Coffee will be served in the mornings only, provided the weather is fair. Hans von Schiller, who is in charge of the commissary of the airship, is planning to serve 
cocoa chiefly as a drink, because of its nourishing qualities. There will be in the larder of the dirigible hardtack, concentrated meat cubes and canned vegetables. Fruit will
 be served sparingly. Schiller will provide plenty of drinking water, but persons may take aboard some "bottled goods" if they so desire. There is to be no smoking

 factories,' said Manz. 'As a matter of fact everything is fresh and is being put into cans now because of course, the food would not keep throughout the voyage unless 
hermetically sealed. I do all my own canning and my sisters affix the labels. My father way purveyor to the King of Wurttemberg, so we are used to supplying only the

<b>What did they serve on the Hindenburg [aka LZ-129]?</b><br>
"Much attention had been given to "Hindenburg's" public rooms, where Dr. Durr and the airship's designers had excpected that the 
passengers would spend most of the daylight hours...To port, occupying an area measuring 15 X 50 feet, was the dining room. Here, 
with all the luxury and refinement of a small restaurant, were seats for 34 passengers--at four small tables for 2 person along the 
inboard wall, and at six larger tables outboard. The tables--and chairs likewise--were of a special lighweight tubular aluminum
design--'as light as possible, as stable as possible'--created for the "Hindenburg" by Professor Breuhaus. In the dining room the chairs
were upholstered in red. The inner walls, covered with airship cotton fabric and off-white in color, bore 21 original paintings
by Professor Arpke...the colorful paintings in the dining room represented "Graf Zeppelin" on a South American journey...
Meals in these surroundings were an unforgettable experience. Passengers were assigned seats by the chief steward (obviously there must
have been two sittings)...The tables were laid with white linen napkins and tablecloths, fresh-cut flowers, fine silver, and the special
china service created for the "Hindenbug."...Exquisitely confected of "Heinrich Ivory Porcelain," it is marked on the bottom "Property of the
German Zeppelin Reederei," bears a chased gold and blue band around the rim, and exhibits the Reederei crest--a white Zeppelin, outlined in gold,
superimposed on a blue globe with meridians of longitude and parallels of latitude in gold. On dishes thus decorated the chief
steward and three waiters served meals prepared in German style. Breakfast appears to have been a standard affair of rolls freshly
baked in the ship's ovens, with butter, preserves or honey; eggs (served boiled in the shell for German passengers, fried or 
poached for Americans); Frankfurt sausage, ham, salami, cheese, fruit, coffee, tea, milk or cocoa. On Monday, August 17, 1936, 
"Hindenburg's" passengers ate for luncheon: Strong Broth Theodor, Fattened Duckling, Bavarian Style with Champagne Cabbage, Savory 
Potatoes and Madiera Gravy, Pears Convent Style, Mocha. For dinner there was: Cream Soup Hamilton, Grilled Sole With Parsley
Butter, Venison Cutlets Beauval with Berny Potatoes, Mushrooms and Cream Sauce, Mixed Cheese Plate. All this was served with tall bottles
of Rhine and Moselle wines--Deideshiemer Kranzler Riesling, Piesporter Goldtropfchen Spatlese, Freiherr von Fahnenberg Spatlese, and others,
as well as a few French red wines and an assortment of German champagnes led by the Deinard Cabinett, Troken (some 250 bottles of wine
were carried on each crossing)."<br>

passengers, mostly newspaper men, the same comfort and practicability she had previously manifested in private trial cruises...The luxurious accomodations and stability
 in flight claimed as the main assets of the new dirigible were fully borne out during today's performance. Sitting in a comfortable armchair beside a long, slanting 
observation window in the lounge, the passenger enjoys all the comfort of a first-class movie house as he watches the everchanging colorful panorama of land and water 
below. An excellent luncheon was served while the Zeppelin was flying at ninety knots and the tables, plates and glasses were as free from vibration as they would have
 been on land...Cigar-loving Germans were a little disappointed when they learned a temporary defect prohibited the use of the smoking room, an unprecedented feature 
in dirigible construction. Their disappointment, however, was largely offset by the ingenuity of Hans, general factotum in charge of the luxuruious Zeppelin bar, who had

The earliest trains did not have dining facilities on board. Customers brought their own food or purchased before 
boarding from local vendors. Before long, trackside 
eateries dotted the country. <a href=" http://www.harveyhouses.net/">Fred Harvey's</a> <a href="http://florenceks.com/text/local/local_harvey_house.htm">Harvey Houses</a>
 played a key role in feeding America's rail passengers. Indeed, some folks view his establishments as the 
first American "fast food" resaurants. Passengers only had a half hour or so at each stop! On-board dining was considered from the start of the industry. It took
 time, however, to create a workable system capable of producing acceptable (delicious??!) results.
<p>
<b>In the beginning...</b><br>
"Eatinghouses quickly sprang up at [railroad] junction points, and as traffic increased, dining stations or refreshement 
saloons...were established by the railroads themselves at the towns along the line. A few were excellent and their meals became
famous, but most of them were second rate, and in a number the food was inedible. The railroads made constant efforts to improve
the poor ones, but many of them were let as concessions, and the roads had little control over them...All through trains were delayed
as much as an hour a day to allow time for meals to be eaten, which took from ten to twenty minutes for each meal. In that
limited time there was a wild scramble among the passengers to get down at least part of a meal before the train pulled out.
In winter or in stormy wather many people were reluctant to leave the train, and the old and inform were barred from eating in such
places at any time. The meals were spaced to suit the schedule, and the passengers might get all three meals within a few
hours on one section of the road and fast for long period between meals on another. If the train was delayed, they would be without
food for hours except for such provender as the news butcher brought round. Each eating place usually had its specialty, which
was served every day. After the telepgraph came into use, it was the custom of the conductor to go through the train some time
before it was due at a dining station and ask all passengers who intended to eat there to signify the fact. He would then telegraph
ahead, so that the proper number of meals could be prepared."<br>

---<i>The Railroad Passenger Car</i>, August Mencken [Johns Hopkins Press:Baltimore MD] 2000 (p. 26-27)
<p>
Alongside the railroad station, sometimes part of it, the Harvey House made its appearance--the first one in 1876, at Topeka.
Soon there was one at every larger railroad stop. Havery employed pretty, polite, white-aproned, and very competent 
waitresses, who lived on the premsis, their virtue carefully guarded by chaperones...Guests are from clean plages on 
spotless linen. The food was excellent because Harvey imported European chefs. It was also hot and cheap. Harvey revolutionized
western eating habits."<br>
---<i>Saloons of the Old West</i>, Richard Erdoes [Alfred A. Knopf:New Yrok] 1979 (p. 114)
<p>
"Even in the United States the railroads had avoided looking for ways to better the lot of the hungry passenger. American
railroad managers thought of themselves as people movers, not caterers...The first coaches looked for all the world like
stagecoaches mounted on flanged wheels...The old coaching inn idea of meal stops continued to dominate, although complaints
about the food and service...flitted through newspaper and magazine accounts of adventuresome trips on the new but 
perilous mode of transporation. Ocean liners, river steamers, and canal boats were suggested as role models for food service...
and a rail car built in 1835 for the Phildelphia and Columbia Railroad boasted what must have been a food service counter at one end, 
an innovation that withered as railroad executives concentrated their efforts on haulage to the exclusion of forage. In the
early 1860s, cars that were used to provide meals were nothing more than temporary expedients...Some coaches were only half-gutted and fitted
out with counters thus surveying as forerunners to the coffee shop/coach cars on the "milk stop" runs...As a result, little thought 
as given to dining comfort or variety, and only patrons who could not wait for an end to their journeys, or who did not expect
anything better, patronized them."<br>
---<i>Dining Car Line to the Pacific</i>, William A. McKenzie [Minnestoa Historical Society Press:St. Paul MN] 1990 (p. 25-25)
<p>
Self-contained dining cars made sense on many levels. They eliminated need for stops (faster transport), attracted wealthier
clientele (who demanded creature comforts while traveling) and inspired forward-thinking entrepreneurs (George Pullman, for one).
<p>
"Dining cars had been proposed as early as 1838 and therafter, and in 1863 two restaurant cars were put into service on the Philadelphia,
Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad and operated for several years. These were ordinary day coaches with cross partitions at their
centers. Half of the car was used for a smoker, and in the other half, from the seats being removed, an eating bar, with a 
steam box, was installed. The food was cooked at the terminals and carried in the steam box, and the bar was probably
patronized by men only. It was not until 1867 when the first diner was put into service. In that year George. M. Pullman 
introduced his first co-called hotel car on the Great Western railroad of Canada. This was a sleeper with a small kitchen in one end, 
and the meals were served on tables that were set up, when needed, between the seats. There was an ample supply of elegant crockery
and table linen, and the passengers were given their choice of a number of dishes prepared by a professional cook. These 
comforts...were reserved for the occupants of the car. The advantage of allowing the other passengers to eat aboard were 
apparent to everyone, and in [March 30] 1868 Pullman placed the first dining car open to all passengers in service on the Chicago & Alton."<br>
---<i>The Railroad Passenger Car</i>, (p. 28-29)
<p>
"...the idea of eating on the train was introduced, however haltingly, almost immediately after the first trains started running...The absence of any cooking faciltiies
 indicates the cars were catered at terminals...The first account of a meal served on a train appeared in the Baltimore American of Saturday, November 5, 1842. 
The article described the run of a special train on Novemer 3 which carried the President and Directors of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, "and a few gentlemen
 invited to accompany them," over the 178-mile mainline out of Baltimore to celebrate and show off the completing of the new fifty-five-mile stretch connecting 
Hancock with Cumberland, Maryland. "As it was not designed to stop on up the road, an elegant cold collation was prepared in one of the cars, fitted up for the 
purpose, under the direction of Mr. Barnum of City Hotel, whose skill in such matters is too well known to need commendation. The attention of the company was 
equally divided between the excellence of the fare and the novelty of thirty or forty gentlemen comfortably enjoying a collation while traveling at the rapid rate of 
twenty-five or thirty miles per hour." Called "refectory cars," these B & O creations and their imitators on other railroads served on similar occasions for nearly 
twenty years, the pace of dining innovation apparently at rest. But even this earliest account includes the mention of three elements that were to characterize 
dining-car service for the next 125 years. The food, even in the remote and primitive "wild regions of the Allegheny hills," was termed "elegant." The creative source 
of the food was the menu of an already-famous hotel, a practice many in railroad management realized established instant credibiltiy among those who requested 
first-class intercity trains for their dining-car service. And a renowned chef oversaw the operation...It wasn't until the Civil War period that food was systematically
 prepared and served on trains. Then, boxcars containing straw mats and hammocks were used to carry wounded troops from the battlefield to treatment facilties
 in the North and East. At first, food was prepared on primitive stoves in the individual boxcars. But by 1863 full realized hospital trains were in operation and
 included a kitchen car containing a range, cupboards and sink, a food storage compartment, and a dining area with a long table and benches. Food could be eaten
 there or delivered to the soldiers lying in converted boxcars and coaches on either end. The first dining cars to be called such and to be part of the established
 make-up of a scheduled train also appeared in war, in 1862 on the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad. H.F. Kenney, general superintendent of the
 PW&B described these two cars as remodeled day coaches, each fifty feet in length and each fitted "with a partition running through the center, crosswize, one
 end being for smokers, and the other as an eating bar, fitted with steam box and other fixtures usually found in a first-class restaurant...The diner of 1862 was a
 baggage car, retired from heaavy work on account of long service in the transportation of trunks, and bare as to the interior excerpt that it was furnished in the 
middle with an oblong counter around the four sides of which the patrons ate while seated on high stools...From the insides of the oblong viands were served by 
colored waiters in white jackets. If memory does not betray me, the bill of fare of the diner on the Washington Express consisted chiefly of oyster stew, pie, crullers,
 and coffee...The first primative dining cars continued in operation for just three years, with no public note on the cause of their demise...In 1867 a revolutionary turn 
in the way people ate while riding the train occurred. George Pullman introduced his "hotel car." Named President, it was the first railroad car designed and built for
 the purpose of preparing and serving meals on board and en route, and awakened travelers and railroadmen alike to the full potential of eating on the train."<br>

"Of all traveling, I think that by railroad the most fatiguing...your only consolation is the speed with which you are passing
over the ground...At eery fifteen miles of the railroads there are refreshment-rooms. The cars stop, all the doors are thrown
open, and out rush all, the passengers are like boys out of school, and crowd round the tables to solace themselves with pies,
patties, cakes, hard-boiled eggs, hams, custards and a variety of railroad luxuries too numerous to mention. The bell rings for
departure, in they all hurry with their hands and mouths full, and off they go again until the next stopping-place induces
them to relieve the monotony of the journey by masticating without being hungry."<br>

numerous applicants for that indispensible refreshment during an American Summer, which is provided at the expense of the
railway company."<br>

"The creating of novel restaurant concepts was, by the mid-sixties, a booming business in the United States. Americans had always loved
theme restaurants whether it was a hamburger stand in the shape of a dragon, a Hollywood nightclub done up with waterfalls and 
tropical rain forest, or a deluxe Manhattan dining room set with Roman antiquities. Now the designs and concepts became more 
sophisticated and far more costly, though often the themes were strained and mawkish...Then there was a whole genre of restaurants
set atop a tall building or other structure, like Seattle's Top of the Needle, which opened May 22, 1961, at Seattle's Century
21 Exposition. Set at the 500-foot level of a 600-foot totem called the Space Needle, the restaurant, designed by John Graham
& Co., sat 260 people and revolved once an hour. What any of this had to do with good food was not of much concern to the

will make one revolution every 80 minutes, rolling slowly on 75 pneumatic tires mounted on standard automobile wheels. The
designer and builder, the Kemmons Wilson Construction of Memphis, chose passenger-car tires rather than solid rubber rollers to
achieve a smoother ride for diners atop the 15-story Mid-City Building on Union Avenue. The revolving section of the eating
place will seat 250 persons, with a stationary center dance floor. At the restaurant's rate of speed--one mile a day--the designer
estimates the 75 tires will last almost until the year 2050. The tires will be accessible by a a crawl space, and in the event
of a flat--considered highly unlikely by the designer--spares will be available. The restaurant, near Methodist Hospital, wil also
have a stationary section seating 250 diners. Power will be supplied by a half-horsepower electric motor."<br>

restaurant will be made to turn one full circle every hour to insure that the tourists dining there see all. The mechanism to make
it revolve is expected to cost about 500,000 rupees ($67,000)...Ashoka's manager, George Verghese, defends the idea strictly
in business terms. He says the revolving restaurant is 'nothing more than a gimmick,' but it will pay. There are successful precedents
in Seattle, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Frankfurt and Dusseldorf in Germany. According to the manager, the idea of the 
revolving restaurant is proof if India's determination to attract tourists....Other observers associated with the tourist trade
here doubt that the revolving restaurant will help bring tourists to the country. They suspect that its real purpose will be
to lure tourists from the Ashoka's main competition, the Oberoi Intercontinental Hotel, a sleek, push-button establishment that

"Sales professionals are constantly on the go. So it follows that they would enjoy having dinner or cocktails on the move as well--at a revolving restaurant or lounge. Here is a selection of such motorized establishments:
Seattle. The Space Needle, built as a symbol for the 1962 World's Fair, houses two restaurants that revolve 500 feet above Seattle. Diners can relax in the casual atmosphere of The Space Needle Restaurant or enjoy fine dining in the Emerald Suite. The entire floor revolves, so both restaurants flaunt views of the entire Seattle area. The Space Needle Lounge is located one floor up on the observation deck, at 520 feet. Both restaurants serve a selection of northwestern seafood and "finer cuts" of beef. The Space Needle is most famous for its dessert, The Lunar Orbiter--a delicious vanilla ice cream dish served over dry ice, so it smokes.
inner entree prices for both restaurants range from $19 to $31. Reservations are recommended. 219 Fourth Avenue. 206-443-2100.
Dallas. Visitors can sip cocktails at the Top of the Dome, 63 stories above downtown Dallas, or enjoy a meal at Antares, a floor below. Located at the top of Reunion Tower, both venues revolve, giving patrons a "tour" of the entire metro area in 55 minutes.
Antares offers an American-Continental menu, with dinner entree prices from $17 to $24. The Top of the Dome's featured cocktail, the Electrical Storm, is a lethal mix of liquors, colored blue, and served with a little plastic lightning bolt. 300 Reunion Boulevard. 214-651-1234.
Ft. Lauderdale. The Pier Top Lounge, crowning the Pier 66 Resort & Marina, is more than a revolving bar, it's a theme. Created by Philips 66, the lounge takes 66 minutes to rotate, and the elevator ride is 66 seconds long. The favorite drink is 66 Sunset Strip, and there used to be 66 tables (but they've recently added a few). The catch: it's on the 18th floor.
Ft. Lauderdale's flat landscape allows for endless miles of views from the Pier Top: Customers can enjoy drinks and cold appetizers while watching the scenes change from the Intracoastal Waterway to the Atlantic Ocean to Port Everglades to the Miami skyline. 2301 SE 17th Street Causeway. 305-525-6666.
New Orleans. The Top of the Mart, the largest revolving bar (or restaurant) in the United States, sits 33 stories above the banks of the Mississippi River in the World Trade Center building. The Mart overlooks the entire New Orleans metro area, so customers can sip cocktails while watching the Mississippi River's traffic as far as 20 miles away.
The Mart serves only drinks and light food. Its most popular drink is the Miss New Orleans, a frozen peach colada that is a perfect compliment to the humid climate. Two Canal Street. 504-522-9795.
Atlanta. The Westin Peachtree Plaza, the tallest hotel in North America, is host to The Sundial Restaurant--71 stories above Atlanta--and the Sundial Lounge--at 73 stories. While viewing the Atlanta metro area, diners can enjoy steaks and seafood in the restaurant, or if they're feeling daring, can venture to the lounge and order a Tweety, the house specialty drink, served in a souvenir Tweety Bird glass.
Three-course meals cost $22.50 to 5. Reservations are recommended. 210 Peachtree Street. 404-659-1400."<br>

<b>Hofbrau Haus, New York City</b><br>
Grand-scale German beer gardens were popular in New York City from late 19th to early 20th century. They were America's first  
theme dining establishments: complete with stages, props, live music and interactive audience entertainment. 
The Hof-Brau
Haus, located at Broadway near Thirtieth Street was one of the best examples of this genre. 
<a href="hofbrauhaus1903.pdf">Restaurant description</a> from <i>Where and How to Dine in New York</i></a> [1903].

<b>Who was the man behind the concept?</b><br>
<a name="janssen">
"August L. Janssen, one of the best-known restauranteurs in the city, died yesterday in the Lenox Hill Hospital. He was  72 years old and lived at 
137 East Thirty-eighth Street. From 1898 to 1938, the famous slogan 'Janssen Wants to See You,' drew thousands of New Yorkers to the 
<a href="restaurants.html#hofbrauhaus">Hofbrau Haus</a> at Broadway and Thirtieth Street, opposite the old Daly's Theatre. It was Mr. Janssen's custom to sound a bell
whenever a new keg of beer was tapped, and as many as thirty were kept on tap at one time. Enrico Caruso, Theodore Roosevelt and
William H. Taft were among his regular patrons. Before the World War three branches of the Hofbrau had been opened in the 
city, but the anti-German feeling during the war forced Mr. Janssen to close the branches. In 1938 the historic Hofbrau
Haus was merged with new quareters in the Graybar Building at Lexington Avenue and Forty-fourth Street, which had opened in 1935. 
Mr. Janssen also had restaurants at Broadway and Fifty-second Street and in New Haven, Conn. In 1928 he opened five places in 
Paris, France, which he operated until 1932. As the president for many years of the Society of Restauranteurs, Mr. Janssen was the
leading spokesman for the restuarant keepers of the city. In this capacity he was active in the fight against prohibition and sought
to keep prices up in restaurants during the hard years of the depression. When the United States entered the World War, Mr. Janssen 
became chairman of the Mayor's Committee on Food Waste. He had noticed the great wastage of food among restaurant keepers
and others, and headed a committee which made a report to the Mayor on the subject...Mr. Janssen was born in Emden, Germany. He was forced to 
cut short his studies at the University of Goettingen by the death of his father, and traveled over Europe, North and South
America for a time supporting himself as a musician and tutor. At the age of 20 he arrived in New York and went to work for Pursell
& Co., well-known caterers of the Eighteen Nineties. He spent several years with the firm, learning New York and the ways of its 
inhabitants, and by 1989 had saved enough money to open his Hofbrau Haus. He succeeded Oliver Morosco, the theatrical producer, as 
president of the Morosco Holding Company, a real estate concern, but lost considerable money when the firm went into receivership in 
1923. Mr. Janssen was one of the founders of the Broadway Association and was always active in the welfare of the street on which his
restaurant was situated. New was also a founder of the New York Rotary Club and made several trips to Europe in connection wtih the affairs of the 
Rotary International. He was a member of the New York Athletic Club and was a Mason."<br>

<b>Golden Door, Idlewild Airport, NYC</b><br>
In 1957, Idlewild International Airport (now Kennedy Airport) was transformed from aging infrastruture to gleaming 
state-of-the-art crossroads of the jet set world. Among the many transformations, were food service establishments and
airline clubs with private bars. The primary foodservice vendor was Brass Rail Inc. The Golden Door was the
fanciest restaurant in the new airport. Menus were printed in several languages and the wine list compared favorably (albeit
expensively) to the top restaurants in New York City. This was a time when visiting an airport for the sole
purpose of exquisite dining made sense. 
<p>
The restaurant's name was borrowed from Emma Lazarus' poem adorning the Statue of Liberty. The vision was the same; the demographic
was different. Many famous people spent time at the Golden Door. Craig Claiborne, <i>New York Times</i> food critic, found the menu only
slightly flawed. Robert Frost, American poet, was bewildered by all the choices. 
<p>
Times change. In the mid-1960s the Golden Door was sold to Restaurant Associates and
renamed Restaurant America. Idlewild was also renamed, honoring John F. Kennedy. This restaurant flourished, flatlined,
then perished. The Golden Door/Restaurant America shuttered permanently December 10, 1971 by court order.
<p>
<b>[1958]</b><br>
"Since an international airport theoretically is a place where first impressions count and partings can be pleasant, it is a pleasure to report that the new Golden Door
 Restaurant at Idlewild is a creditable addition to the roster of the nation's dining establishments. The food is reasonably priced and of a generally high caliber, the 
service is excellent and the decor by Florence Knoll is sparkling and spacious. It is obvious that careful planning has gone into the choice of foods served there. The 
number of dishes outlined on the menu is interesting and varied without being extensive to the point of confusion. At a recent luncheon for two, the meal began with 
snails and a dish called, for some curious reason, baked oyster souffle. The name is misleading, for it applies to oysters on the half shell that have been covered with
 a rich and delicious cream sauce containing crabmeat and then baked in the oven. The oyster shells are served on a bed of flaming rock salt, a novelty that also has 
its practical side in keeping the appetizers piping hot. The snails were served on large, sauteed mushroom caps. These were swimming in a melted butter sauce 
delicately flavored with garlic and parsley. The entrees for this luncheon were highly palatable...A whole broiled squab chicken was well flavored...A serving of beef 
Stroganoff with wild rice was delightfully seasoned, although the authenticity of the restaurant's version of the dish is open to question. Filet mignon in a sour cream
 sauce might be a more apt description. The most expensive single serving on the menu is prime sirloin steak for $6.50. There are more expensive dishes, but they 
are sufficient for two. The snails in mushroom caps cost $1.75; the baked oysters, $1.75. The chicken is $3.25 and the beef with wild rice, $3.50. The decor of this 
establishment contributes much to the pleasure of dining there. Although the interior is vast, there are four color groupings of chairs and tables, an arrangement that 
contributes the effect of four rooms without dividing walls. It thus has a feeling of intimacy. The chairs and banquettes are upholdstered in brillian reds and blues in
 bright contrast to the thick, beige carpet underfoot.  On the debit side, it should be noted that the wines at the Golden Door are expensive. It is unfortunate that 
another name has been added to the long list of establishments that have found it necessary to price their wines beyond the buying capacity or the will of the 
average public."<br>

"To an erstwhile immigrant the recent refurbishment of the International Airport at Idlewild must seem strange when he recalls the scene of an earlier day, when 
millions of arrivals from overseas gleaned their first impression of America from the forbidding structures at Ellis Island and the depot at Castle Garden. To them this
 was indeed the 'golden door' celebrated by Emma Lazarus. For those fleeing from persecution and pesitcelnce, who reached our shores in ships swollen to capcity 
and beyond, the transition from steerage berth to immigration was a golden one. To the modern arrival the 'Golden Door' now has a more literal connotation--
representing as it does a sumptuous restaurant where he may dine in lavish surroundings immediately upon debarking from a luxurious airplane, equipped with 
comforts undreamed of by those who first came here years ago."<br>

"The main restaurant at Kennedy International Airport was closed indefinitely yesterday by the Port of New York Authority 'in the interest of 
the safety and healf of airline passengers' as the resupt of a labor dispute. The authority directed the operator, Restauran
Associates, to close the Restaurant America in the International Arrivals Building because of poor service, vandalism and the 
spoilage of food. Two incident cited by a spokesman for the authority were the discover of 'either ammonia or bleach' in a tray
 of chicken livers and the discharge of a fire extinguisher over food cooking on a grill. Restaurant Associates, which manages
 the Four Seasons, Mama Leone's, the Forum of the Twelve Caesars, and other restaurants, has charged in a lawsuit that Local 71 of the 
Transportation, Terminal, Interplant and Commissary Employes Union is deliberately sabotaging operations at the airport restaurant
in an attempt to force hiring concessions. The union has denied the charge, countering that the company is guilt of contract violations...
Judge Mishler said that the dispute started July 19, when union employes at the restaurant, formerly called the Golden Door, started
to harass passengers brought in by representatives of Alitalia and KLM...The restaurant, which had employed 85 people, was open from noon to 11 P.M.
and served about 500 meals a day."<br>

<center><font size="5" color="#003366"><b>Salad bars</b></font></center><br>

There is some controversy regarding the *invention* of the salad bar. 
<p>
According to the <i>New York Times</i>, the modern salad bar (as we know it in the United
States) first emerged in the late 1960s:
<p>
"Salad bars first appeared in the late 1960's in midprice restaurants like Steak and Brew, featuring
bon fide salad fixings to keep customers busy and happy until the real food came. Lettuce
Entertain You Enterprises, a group of 35 restuarants in Chicago and other cities with everything
from retro diners to elegant hotel dining rooms, got its start--and its peculiar name--with a salad
bar. The company's founder and president, Rich Melman, began his career in 1971 in Chicago
with R. J. Grunts, a place that featured an all-you-can-eat salad bar with more than 40
items--huge in its day. Even in the early years, there were people who looked no further than the
salad bar
for dinner...Not long after they opened, the Steak and Brew restaurants, which offered the salad
bar free with the steak, found it necessary to set a price for a meal consisting of items only from 
the salad bar. The sideshow had become the main event. It was a cheap meal..."<br>
---"Spiced-up salad bars, at $5.95 a pound," Florence Fabricant, <i>New York Times</i>,
September 21,
1994, p. C1
<p>
Modern food historians readily credit Rich Melman with introducing  the salad bar, citing RJ
Grunt's opening in June 10, 1971 as the *birth date* for this dining phenomenon. <a
href="http://www.leye.com/company/history.htm">Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises</a> continues to flourish.
<p>
<b>Counterclaim?</b><br>

"As it turns out, there are a number of competing claims as to who came up with the first salad
bar and when they did it. The Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary, 10th edition, said the term
originated in about 1973, and refers to it as "a self-service counter (as in a restaurant) featuring an
array of salad makings and dressings." The folks at Merriam Webster's may have been taking there
cue from the Wendy's chain of fast food restaurants, which began featuring salad bars in the early
1970s. But even Wendy's doesn't claim to have developed the first salad bar, just the first one in a
fast food chain. <p>

Many sources give credit for the first salad bar to RJ Grunts, a Chicago singles bar and restaurant
that began featuring a salad bar in 1971. That claim is trumped by a place called Chuck's Steak
House, which advertises that it had the first salad bar in its Waikiki, Hawaii, location in 1959, the
same year Hawaii achieved statheood. Chuck's opened a branch in Los Angeles in 1961, which
also gives it a claim to having the first salad bar in the mainland U.S. 
<p>
So where does Springfield fit into this? <br>

That's where it gets interesting, because there is evidence that a Springfield restaurant called The
Cliffs, at 1577 W. Wabash Ave., may have had a salad bar up and running as much as a decade
before even Chuck's Steak House in Waikiki thought of the idea. The evidence includes a 1950
postcard put out by the restaurant that advertised it as the "originators of the famous salad bar,"
and a 1951 Yellow Pages listing that said the same thing, this time referring to the "salad bar
buffet." 
<p>
The Cliffs was operated from the late 1940s to the early 1960s by Sam and Viola Cliff, both dead
now for more than a quarter of a century.  Maybe Sam and Viola had something else in mind
when they coined the term "salad bar", something different from the modern meaning of the term,
but it's hard to imagine what, especially with the word "buffet" used in the phone directory listing. 
So maybe it's time to set the record books straight, tell RJ Grunts and Chuck's Steak House to
forsake their claims and recognize The Cliffs, and the Cliffs, for the culinary innovators they
were."<br>

Steak houses originated in New York City. Why? New Yorkers
could afford to spend the most money and demanded the best cuts of beef.
<p>
"True, the Old Homestead in Manhattan opened in 1868, Keens Chop House in 1885, Brooklyn's
Gage & Tollner debuted in 1879, and Peter Luger in 1887, but those revered establishments drew
more on English and German models. Luger still features only one cut of steak--the sliced
porterhouse, a term derived from English taverns serving porter beer and popularized about 1814
as a steak in America by porterhouse proprietor Martin Morrison in New York. 
    The New York steakhouse--a term still used outside New York to draw customers in the same
way ads proclaim "London pub" or "Parisian bistro"--developed along lines drawn at Palm (1926)
and Gallagher's (1927), both of which originated as speakeasies during the Noble Experiment of
Prohibition. Palm was run by two Italians, John Ganzi and Pio Bozzi, on Second Avenue. (The
name was supposed to be "Parma," after the owners' hometown, but a city bureaucrat spelled it
wrong on an official document, and so "Palm" it remained.) Gallagher's, on 52nd Street off
Broadway, was named after former Ziegfeld-girl-turned-speakeasy-owner, Helen Gallagher. Both
places democratically served a little beer, a little hooch and a little beefsteak to everyone from
New York's politicians and journalists to Caf‚ Society, who sometimes got their pictures or
caricatures put up on the walls. Such places had a swagger, a very masculine feel to them and a
perception of exclusivity that made everyone want to go there. 
     After Prohibition ended in 1933, Palm, Gallagher's, Jack Lyons, Manny Wolf, Cavanaugh's,
Christ Cella and Farrish's flourished. New York steakhouses got the best meat because they paid
the most and charged the highest prices. The menu, rarely varied, became a formula for success:
prime beef, lamb chops, lobsters, fried potatoes and cheesecake were pretty much the whole
shebang. Wine lists were unknown until the 1980s, when Sparks and Smith & Wollensky invested
heavily in wine cellars..."<br>

<p>
"Steak, rather than hamburger or the hot dog, is probably the most typical American food. Steak
(from Old Norse steik, stick) has meant a strip of meat or fish cooked on a stick over a fire since
the 15th century. From the earliest colonial times until the 1860s what you and I call a steak was
called a beef steak, to distinguish it from the often more common venison steaks, buffalo
steaks....By the 1760s some colonial inns and eating establishments were billing themselves as
beef steak houses. Then around 1866 the first Texas longhorns reached New York via the
Chisolm Trail and the railroads and soon the backyard cows, pigs, and chickens, and the wild deer
and the buffalo, had a competitor--beef raised solely for eating. Thus the modern steak and the
cowboy were born together, and since the mid 1860s steak has meant beefsteak. By the end of the
1860s the beef steak house was simply called a steak house...Popular taste...demanded a thick
sirloin, broiled over charcoal if possible. Thus in the late 1940s and 50s restaurants often
advertised the mouth-watering charcoal-broiled steaks."<br>

1964, the first Benihana of Tokyo restaurant in the United States opened in New York..."<br>

<center><font size="5" color="#003366"><b>Cafeterias</b></font></center><br>
According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, the first print reference in our language for the word cafeteria, generally defined as a "coffee-house; 
a restaurant, esp. now a self-service restaurant" was published 1839: J.L. Stephens Trav. Russian & Turkish Emp. 1. 157 Every third shop, almost, being a 
cafeteria [sic] where a parcel of huge turbanded fellows were at their daily labours of smoking pipes and drinking coffee."
Our survey of American food history sources and historic newspapers confirms cafeterias, as we know them today, first surfaced in the last quarter of the 19th 
century. There were known by several names. 
<p>
<b>The first cafeteria in the USA?</b><br>
The Exchange Buffet, opening September 4, 1885 at 4 
New Street, New York City ["Exchange Buffet Corp. Marks 60th Anniversary," <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, September 4, 1945
 (p. 4)] is generally regarded to be the first waiterless American urban
 establishment. The restaurant was located across the street from the New York Stock Exchange, hence the name. German 
inspired <a href="restaurants.html#automats">Automats</a> debuted in Philadelphia 1902. Who established the first cafeteria, and where? It's difficult to say, exactly. There are
 several claimants to this honor. The fact that self-serve restaurants were known at that time by several names in 
different venues does not help. 
<p>
"Self-service took another form when the cafeteria was invented in the Midwest. The first seems to have been in Chicago in 1893, and by 1895 there were four 
there. Soon every major city had cafeterias where the custom picked up tray, cutlery, and napkin and proceeded down a long counter, choosing food and
presenting a ticket to be punched accordingly. The diner sat at a polished wood table in a tile-walled room often in full sight, through a plate-glass window, of 
passers-by. On leaving, the customer presented his punched ticket at the door, paid the bill, took, a free toothpick, and departed."<br>
---<i>Food and Drink in America: A History</i>, Richard J. Hooker [Bobbls-Merrill:Indianapolis IN] 1981 (p. 325)
<p>
"Distribution of perishable foods to consumers was facilitated by the growth of chain restaurants and cafeterias which in the late nineteenth century had begun to 
supplant the old-fashioned corner restaurant with its greasy, seldom-changed menu. The first to employ the system of keeping down the cost of food by letting 
patrons wait on themselves were quick-lunch establishments for businessmen. The Exchange Buffet, opened in the commercial district of New York in 1885, 
where patrons helped themselves and ate standing, was for men only. But the Automat, a German idea, where nickels dropped into slot released desired food, was
 open to both sexes. With increased employment of women in business, smaller families, and apartment living, eating out became more customary, and restaurants 
and cafeterias increased greatly in numbers. Cafeterias became particularly popular in the twentieth century. Several social and philanthropic organizations run by 
women had established cafeterias in Chicago during the early nineties. A manager of one of these early experiments recognized the commerical possibilities of the 
 idea and set up her own establishment. Another woman was inspired to adopt the plan for a public restaurant opened in Los Angeles in 1905. The principle of
 'see and select one's food' drew crowds, and a brand was opened in San Francisco. In Washington cafeterias appeared in 1915 and increased rapidly in numbers 
during the crowded days of the war. One of the larger chains, Childs, during the war period and the early twenties tried to capitalize on the new knowledge 
of nutrition by including in parentheses after each item the caloric value."<br>

establishment--and simply "cafe."<br>

"The experience of the proprietors of the free and easy eating-houses known as cafeterias, or by names of a kindred derivation, seems to point conclusion that the
 average percentage of honest to be found in individuals of the human species is very slight. Firm in a belief that there was yet corn in Egypt--that the race as a 
whole was not dishonest--these misguided men established a business for the success of which a generally disseminate honest was an absolute necessity...The fact 
that every one who has gone through the lower grades of the public schools has not only had the chance, but has been obliged wto write numerious and 
authoritative statements that honesty is by far the best policy, over and over again, makes it impossible that all people sin through ignorance. yet when, in 
accordance with the cafeteria system, a hundred men and women gathered from a down-town neighborhood are requested to selecte from a rack a check bearing 
the value of the amount that they have eaten, at least seven, and more often ten of them, pick out one from 5 to 20 cents less than they should. So far as is known 
there is yet to be recorded the case of a man who picked out a check larger than he ought...in many cases the proproetors are obliged to go back to the old
 method of checks being given by the waiter."<br>

“Before the advent of the now ubiquitous fast-food outlets, before Southern California's fabled Schaber's and Clifton's cafeterias, there were the Boos Brothers. From humble beginnings, Horace Boos and his three siblings opened one of Los Angeles' first cafeterias in 1906 with unconventional methods and consistent success that inspired subsequent generations of restaurant entrepreneurs. Even though turn-of-the-century Los Angeles served cuisine that ranged from plain to appalling, the Boos Brothers' idea of a fast-food, self-service restaurant was laughed at by critics. Waiting on yourself and returning trays and dishes to the kitchen were unheard-of impositions, even for the city's much-put-upon diners. Editorials poked fun at the thought of a "grabeteria" and said it would not work. But the hungry public didn't agree, and the brothers' downtown cafeteria was the first link in a chain of seven that ultimately stretched from Los Angeles to San Francisco. Midwest Roots
The Boos Brothers were born in Moscow, Ohio. Horace, the eldest, born in 1872, was 15 years old when both of his parents died, leaving him to head the family.
The brothers worked side by side, first by opening a small grocery store and later a restaurant in St. Louis. With a small amount of capital, the four siblings came west and bought a farm in the San Fernando Valley, growing vegetables and raising chickens to feed Angelenos in what would become their next restaurant venture.
Observing the efforts of Helen Mosher, who took over the defunct Hafen House, a favorite German resort, and turned it into the city's first cafeteria, a hole in the 
wall on Hill Street between 3rd and 4th streets, they decided to expand on her idea. She advertised: "All Women Cooks--Food That Can Be Seen," and best of
 all, "No Tips." Mosher was a pioneer, but the Boos Brothers cooked up culinary history. Their first gamble was a site on the gastronomically deprived south side of
 2nd Street between Spring and Broadway. Orlando "John" was chef; Cyrus the butcher and baker; while Horace and Henry washed dishes, swept the floor and
 took in the money. Determined that quality food--temptingly displayed--together with cleanliness and courteous service would overcome the public's prejudice 
against self-service, these self-made men of wit and charm used a full plate of new ideas to build their cafeteria into a new type of dining empire. Rubbery chicken 
was bounced out of the kitchen and lumpy mashed potatoes were banned. Only the cream of the crop survived, as they opened six more cafeterias on Broadway, 
Olive and Hill streets, Santa Catalina Island and two in San Francisco. After a year, the ranch failed because the brothers were too busy to tend it. But the cafeteria 
that had become known as an "indoor picnic" was by then the city's hottest restaurant. Its business received a boost when adoption of the 18th Amendment
 imposed Prohibition, closing downtown saloons, which traditionally had served a free lunch. Angelenos turned to sumptuous yet inexpensive cafeteria fare, which
 was consumed by Boos Brothers patrons listening to Pryor Moore's nine-piece orchestra renditions of "I Kiss Your Hand, Madam," "Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah" and
 "Just a Little White House," punctuated only by the clatter of utensils. After World War I, an employee returned not only with a French wife, but with an award-
winning French lemon pie recipe, which was soon one of the chain's staples. Employees in all seven cafeterias began competing in culinary contests and their recipes
 were added to the menu. By the 1920s, the chain of cafeterias had become so widely known that Los Angeles was dubbed by some "Sunny Cafeteria." Lonely 
Midwesterners formed clubs and held meetings, turning them into lonely hearts clubs. At the Boos flagship cafeteria on Hill Street across from Pershing Square, the 
Nature Club of Southern California met every Tuesday, while Sierra Club members gathered on Fridays. Prospective club members sat at separate tables, where
 their behavior and manners were observed. When Horace Boos died in 1926, the surviving Boos Brothers sold the seven cafeterias for a record $ 7 million to
 Childs Corp., a national chain of restaurants. Business, however, was on the decline. Bringing in near-beer and wine and even ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and his
 dummy Charlie McCarthy didn't help sales. With the onset of the Depression, Childs sold two of the Boos Brothers cafeterias to Clifford E. Clinton, who launched
 the Clifton's chain, and Henry Boos bought back two more, one on Hill Street and the other in Avalon on Catalina Island. Back in business, the Boos Brothers
 offered inexpensive fare of a "40-cent dinner" that made the cafeterias especially popular with the starving artists and angry intellectuals of Los Angeles during the
 Depression. Garnering a reputation with a multi-course feast for more than four decades, these unflashy foodmeisters called it quits in the late 1940s, before
 cafeterias would begin to lose popularity with the advent of luncheonettes, soda fountains and fast-food restaurants.”<br>

"It's high time this cafeteria habit was looked into: even the superior judges have got it. When court adjourns at noon each day, dignitaries of the bench are to be 
seen marching solemnly down the Courthouse hill and into one of these reach-out-your-arm-for-what-you-want emporiums. There is no doubt that if this method of
 nourishing the human system is kept up for any length of time, the right-arm muscles will become abnormally developed: incidentally, the profession of waiter will 
become extinct. There is, perhaps, a question about the propriety of abnormally developing the right arm, but the waiter and all his kind can be spared witout a pang
 of regret.. A waiter is a living object made in the duties of a human being...A cafeteria is a place whre you hae to carry back the dirty dishes, and remember to be 
cautious with the butter, for another plate of butter will cost 1 cent more. Eating seems...to be a mistake. It  only serves to maintain the rather unnecessary existence 
of a tedious and commonplace race of beings who murder one another and get all the others in a stew about it. At the present writings, "cafeterecing" is the favorite 
method of conduct the habit mentioned. The cafeterias have all the other Los Angeles restaurants worried. These hand-out shops are springing up on every side.
 The are giving the "old line"cafes and lunch rooms a mighty jolt, and some of them are giving better service since the hehlp-yourself innovation was brought
 along...
The first impulse upon entering a caferteria is to slide bashfully into the first seat that presents itself. The a scowling young woman bears down upon you and sternly 
orders you into the lock-step with the others. Standing in a long line betwen a fat woman and a small boy, you finally float around to a table with a lot of silver 
knives and forks, and spoons and trays. With a tragic instinct, you dig into the collection, although you are half afraid the severe-looking young woman will rush up 
and accuse you of stealing the silverware...It is easy to see why women go: it's because the checks all end in odd-change numbers, like 21 cents..."<br>

"Cafeteria Psychology</b><br> 
'I am,' said the woman, a cafeteria addict. I go to the cafeteria rather than the restaurant because their coffee is hotter, it comes direct from the urn to me, and warms my heart as I drink it. The soups are hotter, too, and they all other foods meant to be hot come right from the kettle to the customer without the long preambles, the waits and inspections and other performances involved in their transference form the hotel or restaurant kitchen to the dining room table, during which hot dishes grow cold, and cold grow lukewarm, and everything steamy gets sodden. Also, when there is a question of a ‘chancy’ food like cantaloupe, I am able to order one from visual inspection rather than from a bill of fare which may read ‘Rockyford melon,’ and turn out to be something like a mealy potato when it comes to the cover. The same holds good for all other fruits, and for pies, cake, dishes of pickles and preserves, vegetables, salads, In the best cafeterias everything is in full view, your slice of roast beef is cut from the hot joint while you look on; your chop is offered for your inspection before it is broiled, you pick you’re your baked potato and point to the salad of your choice. In the best cafeterias—those which are increasing by geometrical progression and are thronged for six hours every day, yet where room is always found for one more by a watchful manager—in these cafeterias I get service plus, meaning service plus courtesy and pleasant human relations. The counter people seem to have the gift of kings and princes in remembering faces, that gift of good democrats in according them welcoming recognition, and that further gift of the born restaurateur in remembering tastes. After one or two requests for the wishbone, the short-bone, or any other bone of the roast chicken, the man will put it aside for you while you are yet three places off. You are free to ask for the red-cheeked baked apple, for the dish of pudding that you know will ‘go to the spot,/ and it will be given you pleasantly as if the party of the second part liked to do it. Finally, the appraiser of the contents of your tray smiles at you, welcomes you back if you have been on vacation, the cashier bids you good-day as you approach with your check, and thanks you when you pay. You leave the place comforted and feeling good. But there are cafeterias and cafeterias. These are others where the counter-folk are morose, they look at you forbiddingly, and never show the smallest recognition of you, not through you may have been going to the place every day hand-running for months. In these cafeterias a stony deafness is returned to your request of the triangle of pie you like best. Your things are pushed over the bars to you with the gestures of person who are saying in their hearts, ‘I <i>hate</i> to do this!’ Their appraiser registers grimness as she punches your check, and as for the cashier—she acts as though she were paid to be rude. The class of cafeterias first described are run by men and women for men and women. The second, by women only for women only. My query is: Why are the ministrations of women only to women only so often highly flavored with disagreeableness? Our answer was, ‘Search me!’ and we gave it up. Such knowledge is too wonderful for us. Psychologists, please answer.”

Food scholars generally cite 18th century Paris as the <a href="restaurants.html#restaurants">"birthplace of the modern restaurant"</a>.
Really? Historians tell us Marco Polo experienced full-service restaurants while traveling the Far East in the 13th century. Sung [Song] dynasty-era
restaurants were ubiquitious in capital cities. They were patronized by the wealthy for all sorts of pleasurable
experiences, including food. 19th century Chinese restaurants welcomed all classes of citizens. Seating, service and
dishes accomodated all purses. Citizens also enjoyed a variety of casual food service options: tea houses, noodle bars, 
street vendors and such.
<p>
"Prepared food purchased either in one of many kinds of restaurants or from a vendor was, for people of Sung times, part of an
activity both casual and deeply felt that it brought them very close to what it meant to be a citizen of the greatest city of
the world...Scarcely a section in any of the well-known memoirs of life in the capitals fails to mention some popular 
restaurants...Eating at restaurants was an inseperable part of being a city dweller. Restaurants created a demimonde with its
own delights, hazards, bywords, and peculiar flavor...Wine and tea houses in both Kaifeng and Hangchow lured customers with...fine food.
Most of our sources do not describe the wine or tea served at various shops nearly so elaborately as they do the food, and they 
generally rank them on the quality of food rather than their drink. A Southern Sung source gives a 'casual list' to two 
hundred and thirty-four famous dishes that such places served, a list from the Northern Sung has fifty-one. Dinners probably
startd with a soup or broth like 'hundred flavors' soup, which heads both list. They coud then choose from dishes made from
almost any variety of flesh, fowl, or seafood--milk-steamed lamb, onion-strewn hare, fried clams or craqbs. Several kinds of 
'variety meats.'  lungs, heart, kidneys, or caul were cooked in various manners. Some kinds of buns and cakes were also 
availablle, though other kind of restaurants specialized in such things. 'Imitation' dishes comprised a relatively large part of
the menu--'imitation river globefish,' for example...Ordering was done in approximately the same way in Kaifeng and in Hangchow, wehre all 
restaurants had menus. 'The men of Kaifeng were extravagant and indulgent. They would shout their orders by the hundreds: some
wanted items cooked and some chilled, some heated and some prepared, and some iced or delicate or fat; each person ordered
differently. The wiater then went to get the orders, which he repeated and carried in his head, so that when he got into the kitchen
he repeated them...restaurants came into and went out of fashion regularly...A step down from the wine restaurants were
those which specialized in a particular food, a particular style of cooking, or, as with noodle shops, a category of food...
For anyone wealthy enough, Hangchow afforded an unusual service; 'tea and wine kitchens' furnished with everything necessary for
a banquet: they reserved the hall, arranged for the food, conveyances, dishes, and napery, and, if necessary, guided the
customer in the appropriate etiquette for his party."<br>

1977 (p. 158-163)

"Restaurants have a very long history in China. At a time when fine food in western Europe was confined to a handful of great
monestaries, the Song Dynasty capital, Kaifeng, supported hundreds of commercial food businesses and a rich gourmet culture...
Some of the city's restaurants were so renowned that the emporer himself ordered out for their specialties; they could also cater
the most elaborate banquets, in their own halls or at the homes of the wealthy. Kaifeng's many eateries also included teahouses
where men could sip tea, gossip, and order snacks or full meals, as well as wineshops, which ere more popular at night...
China's vibrant restaurant culture continued unabated through the end of the Qing Dynasty. The English clergyman John Henry
Gray, one of the few Europeans with a serious interest in Chinese food, summed up the typical nineteenth-century urban eatery
thus: 'The restaurants are generally very large establishments, consisting of a public dining-room and several private rooms.
 Unlike most of he buildings, they consist of two or three stories. The kitchen alone occupies the ground floor; the public 
hall, which is the resort of persons in the humbler walks of life, is on the first floor, and the more select apartments are on 
the second and third floors. They are, of course, resorted to by the wealthier citizens, but they are open to persons in all 
classes of society, and it is not unusual to see in them persons of limited means. At the entrance-door there is a table or
counter at which the proprietor sits, and where each customer pays for his repast. The public room is immediately at the head of the first 
staircase, and is resorted to by all who require a cheap meal. It is furnised, like a cafe, with tables and chairs, a private room having
only one table and a few chairs in it.'...All guests, rich and poor, entered the restaurant through the ground-floor kitchen,
where they could judge for themselves the skill of the chefs, the quality of the roasted ducks, chickens, and pigs hanging from
the ceiling...and the facility's cleanliness."<br>

<b>Chinese restaurants in the United States</b><br>
"...In 1847, the first Chinese immigrants settled in San Francisco and were followed by thousands who helped to build the transcontinental
railways. The meals of hundreds of California families were influcenced by cooks who were Chinese and had been hired as housemen in middle-class homes.
They seldom were permitted to prepare Oriental meals, but they held to their art of serving vegetables that do not lose their crispness
or color...Other Chinese were cooks for the work gangs...In the early California Chinese restaurants there was a willingness to cater
to customers--some proprietors served their non-Chinese clients only what they though those diners wanted, that is chop suey and 
fried steak. Better restaurants gained fame on San Francisco's Grant Avenue..."<br>
---<i>American Food: The Gastronomic Story</i>, Evan Jones, 2nd edition [Vintage Books:New York] 1981 (p. 166)
<p>
"When mining and railroad work were no longer available and discrimination against the Chinese was at its peak, many Chinese
men found work as cooks and later opened restaurants. These eateries served primarily foods of their native land to other
Chinese patrons. Later they served much the same fare to those willing to try Chinese food...Rare among those who opened these Chinese
eateries was a trained cook. Even more rare was someone from China who had a lot of experience eating fine food in restaurants.
The immigrants were poor working-class men who cooked and served the foods they remembered eating before they left southern
China. At first, they cooked with neither familiar ingredients nor any knowledge about the finer aspects of their own
cuisine...Therefore, when they cooked for others in the United States, they prepared improvisations of foods they remembered. But,
for their non-Chinese customers, they quickly learned that those in the United States liked beef, chicken, and other meats. So
the early Chinese restaurant cooks made southern Chinese food with more animal protien than they would eat themselves.
Chinese restaurants still emphasize meats and serve fewer vegetables than are commmonly served in China."<br>

<center><font size="5" color="#003366"><b>Surf & turf</b></font></center><p>
While meat and seafood have been served at the same meal since antiquity, food historians
generally agree the pairing of "surf and turf," as we know it today, is a modern American
convention. Fine dining establishments catering to elite diners craving both lobster and steak on the same plate were introduced in
the last quarter of the 19th century. Think: Diamond Jim Brady.
<p>
According to our dictionaries, food reference books, and magazine/newspaper databases, the
term "surf & turf" belongs to the 20th century. More specifically, the 1960s-1970s. It appears to
be connected with theme restaurants targeting young, budget-conscious clientele. <a href="restaurants.html#saladbar">Salad bars</a> have a similar history.
To date, none of our sources reveal the name of the person/place responsible for coining
the phrase. 
<p>
"Surf'n'Turf. A term invented by American restauranteurs and their marketers for a dish that
contains both seafood ad meat--a concept that strikes terror into pendantic European
gastronomes."<br>

<p>
"Salad Bars, "Freshly Baked" Bread, and Surf & Turf...It was almost a given that a salad bar
restaurant would be "themed." Victoriana was particuarly popular, and countless restaurants
strove for that olde-tyme atmosphere--while serving completely modern food, of course. The
Wall Street in Indianapolis featured surf and turf with a salad bar and "turn-of-the-century stock
market decor."...The patrons of these restaurants were usually young..."<br>

Our survey of ads published in USA newspapers confirm the term "surf & turf" begin surfacing in the mid-1960s.
Restaurant ads touted "Surf & Turf Combination" in papers across the country. The earliest print reference we have (so far)
was published in the 
<i>Eureka Humboldt Standard</i> [CA], August 14, 1964 (p. 2). This article suggests the concept is relatively new: "An entree in restaurants in Portland [OR] is called surf and gurf--a combination
of lobster and steak."---"Food With a Foreign Flair," <i>Chicago Daily Defender</i>, May 4, 1967 (p. 22)
The oldest printed reference to "surf & turf" in <i>The New York Times</i> appeared in an
advertisement for Chelsea Seafood Restaurants, December 27, 1968 (p. 18). 
<p>
A <i>New York Times</i> restaurant review
for The Harbor, Parsippany NJ printed October 14, 1972 (p. 71) states "The ubiquitous surf and
turf grill, which is America's favorite lobster and filet mignon combination, heads the list of main
dishes." The term "ubiquitous" confirms general acceptance/popularity in the 1970s. <b>Please note:</b>
A truly thorough search for "first mention" requires checking all variant spellings (surf and turf,
surf'n'turf, surf-n-turf etc.).

<center><font size="5" color="#003366"><b>Take out</b></font></center><br>
The evolution of modern American take out (& <a href="restaurants.html#takehome">take home</a>) foods is a
fascinating
convergence of social history and packaging technology. A survey of articles published in the <i>New York Times</i>
suggests the 1950s as the "start date" for modern take-home meals in the United States. This also
coincides with the explosion of family restaurants, mainstream "ethnic" and backyard barbeques.
Why?
Returning WWII GI's settled their families in the suburbs.  And then came  television.
<p>

"The term "take-out" describes both a style of eating and a growing list of prepared foods that
consumers
purchase from a restaurant or food stand and eat in another location. Delivery format, packaging,
and types
of food vary greatly, ranging from hamburgers to expensive gourmet fare, but all may be
categorized as
takeout because of this off-premise consumption. In the United States, take-out food is often
viewed as
synonymous with fast food...The concept of take-out food and the pracatice of buying prepared
foods for
consumption elsewhere date to early civilization. Roadside stands and food stalls in busy urban
markets
were commonplace in ancient Greece and Rome...Almost every culture in every era has had its
version of
take-out foods...Urban industrial workers in nineteeth-century America further popularized
take-out foods.
Food vendors sold various sausages and stews from carts outside factory gates, catering to
workers with
little time or money...In many urban areas, ethnic Italian and Chinese restaurants competed with
early
hamburger outlets for take-out customers. Small storefront pizzerias and "chow chow houses"
sold
inexpensive pizzas and Americanized Chinese foods on a primarily take-out basis. Using broad,
flat white
cardboard boxes for pizzas and small waxy paper cartons for chow mein and chop suey, these
ethnic
restaurants standardized distinctive take-out packaging that became synonymous with their foods.
Although
popular in city neighborhoods, ethnic restaurants long composed only a small share of the
take-out
industry. Automobiles revolutionized the take-out food industry, requiring larger-volume
production and
specialized delivery systems..."<br>

<b>What about cleverly crafted handled paper cartons used for Chinese take out?</b><br>
 They were "invented" in 1903 by Bloomer Brothers,
a Rochester NY based paper company. The original intent? Oyster pails. 
<p>
"The white take-out carton is an amazingly elegant product. It is a simple design, yet it connotes so much: Chineseness, harried
lifestyles, working mothers, cheap yet filling, late night, eating together without dining together, meal as afterthought...
Pick up a white carton sometimes, and you'll likely see the name Fold-Pak inscribed unobtrusively on the bottom; this is the
 company that makes some two-thirds of the take-out containers in the country. The industry calls the cartons "food pails"...
Tim Roach, a vice president...in the early twentieth century, the cartons were used to hold shucked oysters...At various points...
the carton was used to hold ice cream, deli goods, and even goldfish at carnivals...Around World War II, the box found a different
audience...Somehow...it worked its way into Chinese restaurants as the take-out container and it became the dominant package for 
Chinese takeout...Once it evolved into a container for Chinese food, the company put a generic Chinese design on it. The Pagoda
was it...The demand for take-out boxes across the country is considerable, so the factory operates three shifts, twenty-four hours
a day, nonstop."<br>

"Q. I've long admired the simple-yet-elegant cardboard cartons Chinese restaurants use to deliver takeout orders. Do they
come from China? A. Many come from Hazleton, Pa.,...about 100 miles from New York City. The cartons of folded cardboard, coated on 
the inside, with the wire handles, veritable icons of economy, ingenuity and simplicity, can hold everything from mu shu prk to won 
ton soup, retaining the dish's heat while releasing steam. The Fold-Pak corporation, based in Newark, N.Y. is the nation's
largest manufacture of cardboard food pails for the restaurant and takeout food industry, and its Hazleton plant produces the 
majority of the containers used by New York City's Chinese restaurants. Robert E. Mullally, senior vice president of sales at Fold-Pak
estimates that his company ships about 100 million of the cartons to New York City each year, where distributors sell them to 
restaurants. Fold-Pak cartons are available in plan white, or with a festive pagoda design...The company, originally named Bloomer
Brothers, began manufacturing the containers shortly after 1900, when they were used as oyster pails...The company...became the

"Restaurant Chains Open Up New Field. 
Schraft's, Childs, Bickford's Selling Take-Home Meals to Augment Income.
New Industry Trend Seen
Prediction Made Housewife Soon Will Be Buying Family Dinners Like Groceries.<br>
Restaurant chains and independents here and throughout the rest of the country are building up
new
departments which sell meals for home consumption. The three chains here which are entering this
field in
a big way are Schraft's, Child's and Bickford's. In commenting on this development in the food
field, Keith
R. Mount, assistant merchandising manager of the Lily Tulip Cup Corporation, the company
which furnishes
most of the containers in which food for home consumption said yesterday:
New Industry Trend
"Restaurant sales of food for the home are definately a new industry trend. It won't be long before
the
average housewife will be buying take-home foods like groceries." Mr. Mount explained that the
restaurant
business was been sinking steadily the last few years. Operators can't raise prices any more
without scaring
away what little business they have, he said, but operating costs such as wages have continued to
climb.
Last year, he said, restaurant earned an average net profit of only about 2 per cent throughout the
country
and many of these eating places lost money...The take-home trade has come as a solution to the
problem...restaurants which build up this type of trade can do so on exactly the same overhead
and
production facilities they already have to serve patrons at the tables...Consequently [Mr. Mount]
said take-home sales are all plus business and should be sold at lower prices than regular
restaurant meals because
they eliminate waiters, dish washers, table linen, plate breakage and loss of utensils. One of the
reasons
given for increased demand for prepared meals was television in the home. Some restaurants in
New York
have regular television menus made up for take-home orders. In stressing the importance of
saving the
restaurant business from slipping any further, Mr. Mount estimated that the industry represents
expenditures
by the public of about $12,000,000 each year...take-home orders can easily become the difference
between success and failure. Prelimary reports received by his company from all parts of the
country show
sales increases of 20 to 50 per cent in eating places which have installed take-home
departments..."<br>

The modern credit card industry was launched in 1950 by three friends having dinner in a Manhattan restaurant. The card? The Diners Club. 
The meal is referred to as "The First Supper." 
<p>
<b>The story</b><br> 
"In 1949, Frank McNamara, head of the Hamilton Credit Corp., went out to eat with some of his buddies. At the dinner were Alfred Bloomingdale (grandson of 
the founder of Bloomingdale's department store) and Ralph Schneider, McNamara's attorney. The three men ate at Major's Cabin Grill- a famous New York City 
restaurant located next to the Empire State Building. At the end of the meal, McNamara reached for his wallet and was shocked to discover he'd forgotten it. He called his wife to bring him some cash and rescue him from embarrassment. McNamara vowed never to let this happen again. So he came up with the innovative concept of a card that could be used at multiple locations - with a middleman (Diners Club) between restaurants and their customers. 
In early 1950, McNamara issued 200 Diners Club cards to his associates who often went out to eat with clients. At that time, the cards were accepted at 14 New 
York City eateries. A customer could eat without cash at any restaurant accepting the cards. Diners Club would pay the restaurant and the cardholder would 
repay Diners Club."<br>

The club now has more than 160,000 members…The founders began with nine restaurants on their list. Now there are more than 3,000 restaurants, hotels, and other businesses including establishments in such far away places as Switzerland, North Africa, and Hawaii.

Ralph Schneider, New York City Attorney, and Alfred Bloomingdale, Los Angeles, a member of the New York department store family, were tow of the founders and now are co-owners of the club. The third of the trip of founders, Frank McNamara, sold his interest in 1951 to the other two…Schneider and Bloomingdale said recently …that the highest single bill ever run up by a club member was a $24,000 check charged to a card issued to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios on the west coast.

<b>[1958]</b><br>
“Eight years ago a man named Frank McNamara who was in the commercial credit business reached for his wallet to pay a check at a Manhattan restaurant and found he had no money. He called his wife in Long Island who journeyed over the river carrying the cash in her pocket and a hot look in her eye. The next day McNamara spoke to his partner, one Ralph Schneider, about organizing a credit service to that New York businessmen could eat their meals at a wide assortment of restaurants and get the bill at the end of the month. The result of McNamara’s lapse is a million dollar business largely dominated by the company he helped to form=--the Diners’ Club. It now has more than 800,000 card carrying members who sigh now and pay later at 17,000 establishments world over. With the Diners’ Club charge card, which is issued in the form a a small directory and costs $5 a year, a traveler can charge a bauernwurst in the Kurfustenkeller in Cologne, an aquamarine ring at Stern’s in Rio De Janiero, or an Oriental bath at the Tokya Onsen on the Ginza. At the end of the month he gets one bill from the Diners’ Club. Attached to it are duplicates of the chits mailed in from any place on the globe where he flashed his card during the prior thirty days. Six times a year the subscriber also gets a magazine published by the Diners’ Club, chock full of travel articles geared to entice him to more trips (where he will dine and sign). So many people have been nibbling and scribbling that the Diners’ Club year ending last March came to $92 million. August of 1958 was fifty per cent higher than August of 1957, and the million and a quarter bitter than any other month in Diners’ Club history. A compelling reason for the increase is the stricter set of rules laid down by the Internal Revenue Department requiring spenders to itemize reimbursed expenditures. Another, is the pleasant club-like feeling that derives from walking into a beanery and paying for dinner with a card instead of cash. On the other hand, it is no secret…that a charge account customer will spend up to thirty per cent more if he doesn’t have to count out the greenbacks on the spot.”<br>

After dining at Major’s Cabin Grill in Manhattan, Frank McNamara was embarrassed to discover that he had left his wallet in another suit. His wife paid the bill, but the experience left him thinking about a better solution. At a later meal at Major’s McNamara presented a small cardboard card bearing his signature, which he called a diner’s club card, and said he wanted to sign for the meal the way members at a private club do and be billed later. He was well known at Major’s, and the restaurant decided to accept his idea. Encouraged, Mr. McNamara and his lawyer founded Diners Club…The first card was offered to 200 people, mostly Mr. McNamara's friends and acquaintances. Fourteen Manhattan restaurants agreed to accept it. A year later, the company estimated that 42,000 Americans were carrying the card and that more than 330 businesses were accepting it. Membership cost $3 a year. At first, all cards were charge cards, remaining that balances had to be paid in full each month. Revolving credit cards, which charge interest and allow customers to make partial payments each month, were introduced in 1951 in New York City by Franklin National Bank.”<br>

“Frank X. McNamara, who founded the Diners Club in New York and built it into a $6,000,000-a-year enterprise within two years, died yesterday…His age was 40. Mr. McNamara established the Diners Club, with offices in the Empire State Building, in 1950. He was its president until 1952, when he left to become a sales executive for a lumber company. The Diners Club idea is said to have occurred to Mr. McNamara when he dined out one evening and discovered that he had left his wallet in another suit. He telephoned to his wife to hurry to the restaurant with money to pay his check. He determined then to devise a means of sparing diners from similar embarrassment. Born in Brooklyn, he was an Army veteran of World War II. “

Long before American restaurants offered "doggie bags," hungry consumers welcomed the opportunity to take home surplus 
foods from grand tables.
From ancient times forward, wealthy diners took their pleasure from opulent tables. It was common practice to distribute
leftovers to less fortunate folks (vassals, slaves, servants) and scavenging animals (dogs & pigs). A Second Harvest of 
epic historic social proportion.
<p>
Modern western restaurants were founded on the concept of egalitarian dining. Ability to pay trumped socio-economic privilege. 
Urban freestanding restaurants catered to a wide variety of clientele. 19th century NYC wealthy dined at Delmonicos and the Fifth Avenue
Hotel. Opulence, overabundance, & variety were the period's hallmarks of fine dining establishments. In a time when excess
was valued, the concept of taking some of that (paid for, well cooked) excess home was eschewed. Gauche. Verboten. Medieval-style
privilege social legacy loomed large centuries later. About <a href="foodfaq1.html#leftovers">leftovers</a>.
<p>
This may account for the conflicted acceptance of the modern "doggie bag." 
Today this is an economic no-brainer. In the 1960s this novel practice was a core of hot
social debate. Primary sources confirm the practice of taking the uneaten 
portion of one's meal home from a restaurant was not universally embraced. 
<p>
Our survey of primary historic American sources confirms the
term "doggie bag" (aka bowser bag, bow wow bag, doggy bag) dates to the early 1960s. One of earliest print reference [1963]
might surprise you. If the article is accurate, the some "doggie bags" were actually filled with leftovers from a dog's
meal in a fine California restaurant. 
<p>
The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> traces the term "doggie bag" in print to this 1964 reference:
"More and more, the food in U.S. restaurants seems to be going to the dogs--going there is
papers sacks called Bowser Bags and Bow-Wow Bags...diners-out have grown so insistent on
taking home the leftovers on their plates that restaurant supply houses now sell millions of special
greaseproof containers for this purpose each year...All too frequently, complain restaurant
owners, guests use doggie bags to haul off pilfered ashtrays, pepper mills, and silverware."
---"In the Bag," <i>Time</i>, September 4, 1964 (p. 53)."
<p>
"Doggie bag...Although leftovers have long been packed up for customers, the term "doggie bag"
dates in print to 1963. Two claims have been made for the idea under that name, Lawry's Prime
Rib, a Los Angeles restaurant that dates it usage back to the 1930s, and the Old Homestead Steak
House in New York City, whose owner, Harry Sherry, also began to use the term in the 1930s."<br>

"The practice of toting leftovers for the dogs from meals at psoh restaurants is widespread. The diner has only to ask for a Pup
Pouch, a Rover Sack, or a Fido Bag and the same is delivered with a smile, the theory being that the mutt at home is 
entitled to a fair share of the goodies. But there are some wrinkles about this custom that have been wrinkling me in my
puzzlement department. As a long-time friend of dogs, I am wondering what new breeds must have come into being. Are there
really dogs that eat head lettuce with Roquefort dressing, candied yams, poppyseed rolls, grapes, assorted relishes and French
fries? Steak bones and the tage engs of sirloin are easy to understand, as are the framework of lamb chops. But what kind of
dog is it that conshumes lobster shells, oyster shells and petit fours?...Something is going on here. Someone is saving bargabe as
a memento of a meal away from home. Food is being toted away from restaurants to nonexistent dogs. I have seen sacks filled ot the
to and packed in by restaurant patrons who do not even like dogs. I have seen dog-despisers tote enough foodstuff away from a 
scrumptious meal to keep a would at bay for a week. The nonor system has broken down. It is time for restaurant proprietors
 in demand of dog tags of toter before giving them a sack. Or at the very least, it is time to check the pretense that all food
which leaves restaurants in waterproof bags purporting to be for the benefit of mutts really goes to the dogs. What those sacks 
have been turned into is some cases is Snack Sacks, for taht empty feeling. And when you think of what goes into then and gets all
mixed up together, how hungry can a freelance garbage collector get?"<br>

tired. Sometimes the only way out is to ask for a bowser bag on the pretexct of taking the uneaten part home to a friend. And all this
discomfiture is caused by the food-wolfing that goes on all about us for no reason, except that people never learned how much more
fun it is to savor each bite on the way down and to linger  over it like a lover lingers over a kiss. People are not, after all,

does not ask for a piece of beef, duck, or pheasant to be packed. Szathmary sees it as spinoff of the tightening economy, but
elsewhere there are restaurants elevating the idea to chic. At Boston's elegant Cafe Budapest, a matron looked at the Viennese
sweets beckoning from the dessert tray. Her eyes says 'yes!' Her conscience said, 'No!' Assistant maitre d'hotel Brian Angelo
quietly and gracefully suggested that 'perhaps later, madame might enjoy?' The pastries were delivered to her table in a white
box. In Washington D.C., at The Big Cheese, a place to see and be seen in Georgetown, a couple applauded when waiter Peter
White presented their doggy bag in the shape of a silvery swan...'They look more like party favors than leftovers.' But one man's
edible extra is another's garbage. There are believers and non-believers...Lois Lindauer, international
director of Diet Workshop is a believer: 'Doggy bags are great for dieters. Eye-measure the portion you ought to eat and take the
rest home. It makes good diet sense, as well as good dollar sense.' Jean Voltz, food editor of Woman's Day is a believer. In fact,
the contents of her bags are even tastier the second time in wok suppers, omelets or soups...Paul Kovi, co-owner of New York City's Four
Seasons, is staunchly against it...'I find the idea offensive...'...Author Roy Andries de Groot thinks Alexandre Dumas
might have been responsible for the doggy bag. He cites a note Dumas wrote to his friend Jules Janin: 'I made a salad of foie
gras which pleased my guests so well that when Ronconi could not come, he sent for his share of the salad which was taken to him
in a dish covered by a bag under a great umbrella, so that the rain might not soak the bag and no foreign matter might spoil
the dish. 'I am an inveterate demander of doggy bags,' says De Groot. 'Even if the food is bad, I insist on taking it just to 
throw it away. It is a small project against gross portions at gross prices.'...'It's become the thing to do,' says human-behavior
expert Dr. Richard Gelles...'When the economy goes berserk, behavior changes. In a double-digit-inflation time, the rewards for asking
for a doggy bag exceed the cost of losing fact...''Social status will have an effect. If you feel superior to those who are
serving you, you don't care about their opinion and will ask for the leftovers. If you feel inferior, you will worry about
losing face, perhaps leave an entire extra dinner on your plate.'...says Elizabeth Post, author of <i>'The New Emily Post Etiquette.'</i>
'Doggy bagging can be extremely gauche in a fine restaurant. But in a place it does not matter, why not? You've paid for it.'
It even happens at the White House, although executive chef Henry Haller says 'Never!'"<br>

<b>Bake sales</B><BR>

  The practice of raising funds (as well as donating labor & materials) for charitable causes dates back
 to the dawn of civilization. Modern bake sales descend from this venerable tradition. The general purpose of a bake sale 
is an inexpensive way to raise funds for a common cause. Bake sales are hosted by churches, schools, scouts, community 
organizations and library volunteers. 
<p>
The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> (online edition) traces the first print reference to a bake sale (as a fundraising event) to 1902. This term is used in North 
America/USA. Earliest references  pop up in local newspapers in the eastern states. By WWI, the term is common. Presumably it was a favorite way of Ladies Aid
 Societies to raise money for their causes. It is interesting to note that earliest reference are connected to churches. Such was also the case of ice cream socials. 
"bake sale n. orig. N. Amer. a sale of donated (and usually home-made) baked goods, held as a fundraising event.

<b>Baseball concessions</B><BR>
Most baseball history books skip the contributions made by caterers, vendors, and concessionaires who worked hard to feed hungry fans. Presumably, the foods consumed 
by the earliest baseball fans in the late 19th century were similar to those available in outdoor/sporting venues. Foods served at late 19th century American fairs,
 race tracks, circuses, railroad stops, and such tended to be portable and simple. These included sandwiches, <a href="restaurants.html#baseballpeanuts">peanuts</a>, ice cream, soft drinks, beer, cotton candy, 
and yes, the ubiquitous <a href="foodmeats.html#hotdogs">hot dog</a>. Foods sold in baseball stadiums vary according to local place 
and taste. The menu selections at Fenway and Yankee Stadium are understandably different. Chowder in Fenway; hot pretzels (with mustard) in Philadelphia;
Nathan's Famous in New York.
Then, as today, wealthy people were generally accomodated with finer dining options: outdoor tea rooms and full-service restaurants.
 Foods served to fans in the stands were typically hawked by young men who worked very hard for little money. Then, as today,
<a href="restaurants.html#ballprices">prices were high</a>. Why? Captive audiences in hot outdoor venues have no other option.
The history of baseball concessions, as an industry, begins (according to some) with <a href="restaurants.html#harrystevens">Harry M. 
Stevens</a>. He is also credited for introducing the hot dog to the American public. Notes

<b>Baseball & hot dogs</b><br>
"Consider the plight of the hot dog. Here is an American institution that has quietly and modestly served the nation for more than half a century with far too little 
recognition. Why has this gross injustice been perpetrated in a country so proud of its record for fairness and equality? Because the hot dog has no know 
birthday...no one can point a finger to any specific day and say "This was the start of the hot dog and shall be celebrated ever forevermore." Historians admit that 
the hot dog was born on a cold day in the Eighteen Nineties, but even the exact year remains obscure. The scene of the momentious event was the [New York] 
Polo Grounds. Cold winds whipped in off Coogan's Bluff and the baseball fans shivered in the stands. A young English-born concessionaire named Harry M. Stevens
 was purveying his peanuts and scorecards, but the weather spurred him to history-making action. He recalled that a near-by butcher shop had an assortment of
 sausages hanging in the window, and he sent a boy to buy ten dozens of them. Mr. Stevens dispatched another lad to purchase rolls from a bakery. He tossed the
 wieners into a huge pot half-filled with water and boiled them on the clubhouse stove. He sliced the rolls and inserted the hot wieners in them, then told his venders:
 "Those people are frozen. Go out there and yell, 'red hots, red hots.' The people will buy these red hots if you yell loud enought. Within ten minutes, the red hots 
were sold, and Mr. Stevens, who went on to become a famous caterer, had a new item for his concession. But the saga of the hot dog was not without its 
moments of tribulation. T.A. (Tad) Dorgan, the cartoonist, began to characterize the "red hot" in his sketches as a dachshund between an elongated bun, and he 
called it the "hot dog." This quite naturally started some person wondering what went into the manufacture of the tasty product, and the hot dog business suffered a 
severe recession about 1910. The hot dog had an indomitable spirit, though, and fought its way back to popularity."<br>

"The frankfurter world is agog. There is a profound stir to peanut circles. The possings of gingre ale, sarsaprilla, and spruce-beer
 are heaving restlessly. Their big day is at hand--the opening of the baseball season in New York. It takes place on Tuesday 
next at the Polo Grounds, with the Giants entertaining the Brookly Team. Out at the ballpark the fan of today is not merely
a spectator. He is a consumer, and a voracious one, at that. Refreshments are not incidental with him. They are part of the 
game, as much as the seventh inning stretch or the scramble for balls hit into his section of the stand. It will require more
than 200 white-coated salesmen-waiters to serve him on Tuesday. On some double-headers his appetite and thirst will keep as
many as 250 energetic young men in  constant motion. Eating and drinking at the ball game had a modest beginning, according
to Harry Stevens, who feeds the fans at the Polo Grounds and at the Yankee Stadium, as well as at the homes of both the 
Boston teams. In 1894, when he took up this work, the menus were confined to ham and cheese sandwiches, and the only number on 
the wine list was beer, retailing at 5 cents, with no extra charge for the generous depth of foam...Foodless ball games. Fans
weren't particularly hungry in those days, Mr. Stevens reports. The 'hustlers' employed to circulate food were vigorous to a point
the uncouth at times, yet ball-game patrons seemed to prefer to do their eating in more conventional environment. Attendances
rarely exceeded 3,000, and few persons cared for even Mr. Stevens's nice sandwiches, although the taste for beer on warm days
did not disclose any incipient sentiment favoring prohibition. The peanut quietly took its place onh the roster of things
to eat at the ball park. It was considered somewhat of a stranger at first, possibly being regarded as having lost its way
while being shipped to some circus to join its fiancee, pink lemonade. Take it from Mr. Stevens, there will never be a wedding
between the goober and the crimson citrus concoction, so far as being national-pastime provender is concerned. The New
York fan has learned to love the peanut, but his coldness toward lemonade rivals that of the wildly heralded frigidity of the
drink itself. 'No,' said Mr. Stevens discussing this matter 'for some reason or other the fans hearabout do not care much for
lemonade. The day can be as warm as toast and the lemonade as cold as ice, and still wouldn't mean anything to them. Even with
their coats off and their collars wilted, the fans do not heed the music of the ice clinking in the glass. 'For their thirst
since beer has departed, they choose ginger ale, sarsparilla, and near-beer. But it is comparatively recently that they have
gotten around to taking these soft drinks with any seriousness and in any great quantities. When beer was swept away the fans
had to train their palates to the taste of what the law allows; but trainig has been completed by this time. 'There are some
and refreshments that the New York fan doesn't care for at all. Popcorn was once in high favor at most amusement places,
and we thought we would introduce it to the fans in a big way. We bought a roaster, one of those with a glass case showing the
popcorn popping around like big snow flakes in a blizzard...'New Yorkers, contrary to the report, are not cake-eaters. At least
those who go to ball games are not. We made an attempt to market cakes attractively put up, but the frankfurter devotees 
would not leave off their favorite viand long enough to give the newcomers a chance to make good. 'Ham and cheese sandwiches
had things to themselves for the first fifteen years of my time in the ball parks. When frankfurters were introduced they
were sold at the back of the grandstand. If I were poetic I would say that one touch of the frankfurter made the whole world
kin. At the counters at the rear of the Polo Grounds you would find a prominent banker eating a frankfurter and drinking a 
glass of beer, and beside him would be a truck driver doing precisely the same thing. Both had hurried out to the game, and
this was their lunch. 'Coffee wasn't introduced until eight or nine years ago. It has become one of the most popular beverages
at the ball park. We always thought there wouldn't be any call for it, and we didn't handle it. On several chilly early
season days a baseball writer chided us for not having any hot coffee on sale. We decided to try it. Apparently it answered
a need. 'The excitment and the fresh air of the ball game appear to sharpen the appetites even of dyspeptics. When the desire for
refreshments meets up with a tempting-looking frankfurter, it is good-bye to the latter. The sale of frankfurters was 
increased by several hundred percent when our boys began purveying them up and down the aisles.' The taste of the Western
fan differs somewhat from that of the Eastern. The Westerner is partial to lemon soda, which receives scant attention
from New Yorkers. Popcorn, which had so ignoble a career in this city, is a piece de resistance at Toledo, where Mr. Stevens
also had the commissary concession. The appeal of frankfurters and peanuts, he declared, is national."<br>

"The cry of "play ball" at today's opening game of the world series will find few happier or busier New York business men than the four Stevens brothers. The
 reason? They hold the food and drink concessions at the Yankee Stadium and Ebbetts Field, where all the series games will be played. Although the Yankees did 
not clinch a series berth until last Friday, Harry M. Stevens, Inc., started ordering and preparing foodstuffs several weeks ago...Some Stevens employees worked
 through last night, putting the finishing touches to the mountains of peanuts, hot dogs, ice cream, soda pop, beer and sandwiches...More than 500 Stevens 
employees will report for work today, beginning at 5AM. They include chefs, checkers, cashiers, countermen, accountants, bookeepers and vendors. The normal
 complement of vendors is about 100, but more than 300 will be garbed in white uniforms for today's game...An experienced vender can make about $25 on a 
good day...The Stevens company was founded at the turn of the century by Harry M. Stevens. When he died in 1934, he was acclaimed for having parlayed a bag
 of peanuts into a million dollars...Harry Stevens is credited with having popularized the frankfurter. It happeed at the Polo Grounds, before World War 1, on a day
 when cold weather was curtailing sales. In desperation, the late Mr. Stevens hit upon the idea of boiling dachshund sausages and serving the hot on rolls. Thomas
 A. Dorgan, the cartoonist known as "Tad," heard about this new delight and shortened the name to hot-dog. Today, about six and one-half billion hot dogs are 
sold annually in the United States. Although most storekeepers grill their frankfurters, the Stevens company still boils them...The amount to food to be prepared each
 day depends upon the weather and event. Race track fans are the biggest spenders, per person, but they do not buy peanuts. They're usually too busy with pencil
 and program to take time to shell them. The poorest spenders are football fans. They are too bundled with clothing and gloves to reach into their pockets for a
 coin. Locale is another factor that determines what sports fans will eat. In the Middle West, fans prefer hamburgers to hot dogs. Western crowds will not buy 
popcorn, but it is a bigger seller than peanuts in the Middle West. Fans in most parts of the nation rent seat cushions, but New Yorkers shun them."<br>

<b>Who was Harry Stevens?</b><br>
Tribute from a friend:
"The extraordinary career of an adventurous spirit drew to a quiet close the other evening when Harry Mozley Stevens passed
away. He was known best as the 'Hot Dog King' and the many who 'parlayed a peanut into a million dollars.' But to those who
had the pleasure of knowing him intimately, he was much more than that. His biography would read like a romance. He came to this
country practically peniless and piled up a fortune. He worked before an open hearth in a steel mill in Niles, Ohio, until a strike
closed the mill and put him on the roadside. For two years, wiht a growing family, he couldn't pay his rent. The man who owned his
house was an elderly German. The old German didn't worry. 'You are hgones. You are a worker. You will succeed. And you will
pay me when you can,' said the landlord. It was all true, with something to spare. When Harry Stevens became a rich man he did not forget the
old German. In fact, he never forgot a friend. He worked with a pick and shovel on the county roads to pay off his poll tax. He
became an intinerate bookseller, a native of England peddling 'Irish Orators and Oratory' in the United States...He enjoyed it...
From bookselling, a field in which he gained many friends but little money, he turned to take his first real step on the road to fame
and fortune. He invaded the sports field, getting the score-card concession at the ball park in Columbus, Ohio. From that start
he went steadily ahead to become the caterer and generaly concessoinaire at all the big race tracks in the East except
Pimlico, five major league ball parks and smaller amusement places galore...It was William C. Whitney who insisted that
he run the restaurant at the Saratoga track...It was August Belmont who called him in when he was getting ready to open
Belmont Park and said: 'Name your own terms. You've got to set the table here.'...[Stevens] did the catering at the big polo
matches and the big auto shows. He knew everybody in sports...He had friends who were powers in politics or finance...Caterer in the
old Madison Square Garden, he knew all the famous figures that dined in the roof restaurant there. He was talking with Stanford
White there one evening while a man paced up and down near by, waiting for Harry Stevens to leave the architect's table. The
impatient man was Harry K. Thaw. When Harry Stevens finished his conversation and walked away Harry Thaw advanced on 
Stanford White and shot him. Harry Stevens was at the old Savoy hotel until it closed. He was the last one to leave and the
last meal was served in his room. He moved to the old Waldorf-Astoria and once again hewas the last diner to eat and the last tenant
to move...[Stevens] was a great one for going to the theatres...He was fond of quoting, especially poetry...He worked hard and he
waxed wealthy, he never forgot the days when he pawned hes wife's wedding ring to buy food for the children...He was 
belligerantly proud of three things: his English heritage, his United States Citizenship and the success he had bained by 
unswerving honesty, undaunted courage and bulldog persistency."<br>

"Peanuts have been associated with baseball almost from the beginning. This relationship had been immortalized by the lyricist Jack Norworth and the composer 
Albert von Tilzer in their 1908 song 'Take Me Out to the Ball Game.' However, the peanuts sold at baseball games were not freshly roasted and were frequently 
stale. Some attempts were made to correct this. The Brooklyn Dodgers...recognized the problem and announced that all peanuts sold at the ballpark would be 
roasted that same day. Vendors proudly announced, 'Jumbo peanuts, roasted on premises daily, sold at Ebbetts Field, 10 cents.' Unshelled roasted peanuts 
continued to be sold a baseball stadiums until the owners concluded that the cost of cleaning up the shells was far greater than the revenue generated by their 
sale." <br>

<b>Boxing concessions</B><BR>
This passage describes the foods served at the famous fight between Dempsy and Carpentier [1921]. The fight was catered by
 Stevens, and many of the foods he served at ball parks were also served here:<p>

"Fight fans who crowd the big arena in Jersey on Satuday for the championship bout between Dempsey and Carpentier may swelter or become drenched,...but 
there will be no need of their suffering from either hunger or thirst. That part of the program has been carefully arranged by Harry M. Stevens, who is as well 
acquainted with the appetite of a sport enthusiast as he is with his own son Frank, his partner in the business of satisfying the hungry and thristy at ball parks, race
 tracks, boxing matches, horse shows, six-day races and sport events of every description. The feeding arrangements are along the same extensive lines as prevail 
in every angle of the big contest. For the last ten days Stevens's men have been getting things in readiness at the arena, and yesterday the work of stocking up 
with provisions get under way. Hundreds of cases of beer, sarsparilla, ginger ale and mineral water were taken to Jersey City in big trucks; but the preparation of 
the food will not be started until midnight Friday or later. Time has no effect on the drinks, but the food must be positively fresh...Furthermore, he says with 
emphasis that he will have enough for all and expects to bring back a few truckloads after a new record for the consumption of food and drink at one sporting
 event has been established...One feature of the usual sport event bill of fare will be among the mising. The Board of Fire Commissioners in Jersey City has passed 
a rule concerning the sale of food and drink which may be called a "No Dogs Allowed" announcement. The succulent all-hot has been banned. fear of fire was 
behind the order, and and Stevens has bowed gracefully to the edict, but he admits that he will feel lonesome without the little towsers around...As complete last 
night the bill of fare will include ham, chicken, tongue and cheese sandwiches and every known variety of pie. To wash this down or to quench the parched throat
 will be ginger ale, "sas," mineral waters and the best that Jake Ruppert could brew after Volstead let him up. Peanuts will be there in profusion...To the average 
person who yells to the boy and passes out his change for sandwich, drink or smoke there is no thought of the time, energy and preparation it all entails...Trucks 
will be making their trips to the arena to deposit something like 80,000 bricks of ice cream...There will be no cones on sale, as it would be difficult to keep cones
 in proper condition, so brick swill be carried in cooled containers, to be served on small plates. More than 50,000 bags of peanuts will be ready and the 
sandwiches will run close to the 100,000 mark. Many fans will arrive late, some of the early comers will bring their lunch, but to offset this will be the patrons who
 arrive early and who will trust to Stevens to see that they are supplied with whatever they eat and drink. Hundreds of cases of beer...will be at Thirty Acres long 
before the eatables arrive. Getting the drinks to the arena is only one part of the work. The fan insists on his liquids being ice cold and to chill them properly twenty 
tons of ice will be unloaded at the arena tomorrow morning...On Saturday morning another twenty tons will be received. Again the vastness of the enterprise stands
 out when forty tons of ice are needed for the ice cream and the soft drinks alone. That there may be no gouging of the public by the vendors Stevens will follow the
 system in vogue at the ball parks. Every waiter will carry on his hat a card showing the prices of everything he sells. Big posters around the arena will convey the same
 information. The same prices as prevail at the ball parks and race tracks will be in effect at the fight and the signs protect the public against gouging."<br>

Fair food, as we Americans know it today, descends from street foods sold in ancient market
stalls. Food vendors were quite popular at Medieval fairs. Folks hawked foods from portable
carts the Globe Theatre during Shakespeare's time. On a related note? Military messes
throughout time set up mobile feeding stations specializing in portable foods. 
What is fair food? The answer depends upon the place and period. Some foods are contemporary
"staples," (cotton candy, waffle cones, corn dogs, mini-doughnuts, Karmel Korn); others are
regional/local specialties (maple fudge at the Eastern States Exposition; open pit whole pig
barbecue in Arkansas). 
<p>
World's Fairs (aka exhibitions/expositions) serve as national benchmarks for fair food
introductions. Of these, the 1904 fair in St. Louis is perhaps the most famous. The Corporations
used these venues to promote new products to the general populace. 1964 New York City
World's Fair put Belgian Waffles on our culinary map. Fair years/venues are easy to identify.
Some of the more popular fairs have entire books written about them. <i>Beyond the Ice Cream
Cone: The Whole Scoop on Food at the 1904 World's Fair</i>/Pamela J. Vaccaro profiles that
famous exposition. 
<p>
Local fairs (state, county, seasonal, product specific) reflect the heritage of the folks living in that
area. Most major fairs have Web sites. There you will find current information on food contests and
vendor information. Some fairs publish cookbooks containing recipes of contest winners. These
do not reflect the vendors, corporate promotions or other fair favorites (free milk at the New
York States Fair). Many, though not all, states and cities host <a href="http://www.foodreference.com/html/upcomingfoodevents.html"> 
annual fairs</a>. 
<p>
Your best bet for comparing/contrasting foods served at local fairs throughout the country is to
select target areas and contact the fair managers. Do they have scrapbooks or archives? The local
library and/or historical society may hold primary documents (old fair map maps, menus,
promotional material &c.) Old newspapers often provide accounts of the foods available at the
fair; some aritcles include prices. This information helped visitors plan their trip. Foods offered
at local fairs generally featured local bounty. These fairs were held during harvest time, when
local produce was at its most bountiful. Pies, cookies, cakes, canned goods (jams, jellies,
preserves, pickles, pickled vegetables) were often sold for on-site consumption or bringing home.

<b>[1889] Exposition Universelle Internationale--Paris</b><br>

Our survey of 19th century American magazines and newspapers reveals little with regards to hospitality aspects of this particular exposition. Somewhat 
understandable, given the tension between France and the USA in 1889. Shunning our proposed Corn Palace garnered more headlines. American journalists were 
eager to share the negative aspects of this particular exposition. The "fleecing of America" was a common theme. Nor, apparently were American reporters 
impressed by the "monstrous" Eiffel Tower (which, by the way, housed four restaurants). The great equalizer? Everyone was impressed by Edison's 
electrification. 
<p>
<b>French culinary scene/1889 (political-historical context)</b><br>
"The Universal Exhibition of 1889 marks a turning point. France is back on her feet. Colonization--Indo-China, black Africa, Tunisia-satisfies the capitalists and the 
Jacobins, since the Republic wishes to expand, to put down roots...The Saint-Simonien currents which flowed strongly during the Second Empire--pro-technology, 
Christain, socialist--have ebbed away. In England and Germany, chemical and textile industries expand, while in France they stagnate...Great works are foreseen: a 
railway network underneath Paris...The Eiffel Tower consecrates the Iron Age. Paris begins to enjoy herself again. But there is certainly a latent political crisis. The 
right wing will not give its consent to parliamentary democracy. Boulanger has failed to occupy the Elysee...Strikes are brewing up...Many of the famous restaurants,
 Brebant, Riche, the Anglais, etc. now have open-air terraces. What decadence! Terrace cafes in the courtyards of the gastronomic temples! How long before we 
degenerate to canteens, or even street stalls?"<br>

"Out of this multitude...comes another grievance, and now the exhibition restaurants begin to complain that half the people bring their own provisions. Cold chicken,
 ham, and Strasburg jambonneaux perfume the air, combined with garlic and sausages. To wait for the illuminated fountains and the Eiffel Tower projections the 
people, and even the well-to-do bougeois, eat, drink, and make merry, and make merry, and only extravagant purses patronize the restaurants."<br>

"The predominance of cafes and beer saloons suggests a suspicion that this exposition is a big show to attact business for these two prominent enterprises, and the
 proprietors seem so to view it, i.e., that they are of the most importance, and the wail in the newspapers that the people have the assurance to bring their own
 luncheons instead of buying them. They make grievous complaint, too, that their other conveniences are not patronized, and ask the Government to do something
 about it. The French Government assumes to be a paternal one, but it would be curious to know how it is going to make the public drink more beer. They could 
not well drink less and get any at all, for these Frenchmen have acquire the art of giving out a glass of two-thirds froth and one-third beer, and the whole thing is 
sheer robbery at the price--6 cents per fractional glass, and then two cents to the waiter who brings it. There is a general scheme to pluck the public, and it is so 
barefaced and open as to excite unusual indignation. The beer is fairly good but very light, and it requires several glasses to quench an exhibition thirst. All other 
drinks are as bad as they can be, vile decoctions, and in the line of food poor in quality and extortion ate in price. There is a showy soda font with a conspicuous 
card: 'American Soda Water.' A trial of it proved to be merely still water with a teaspoonful of syrup as warm as dishwater, with no sizz in it at all; and when you 
ask for ice they break off a piece the size of a walnut from a small cake lying on the counter. It melts immediately without cooling the liquid, and you pay 10 cents
 for this fraud. A genuine soda font, served as it is in New York, would be a fortune to its owner, but the French drink the poor stuff under the impression that it is a 
sample of American soda water. They have soda in bottles, but a glass of it is a guarantee for a first class cholic."<br>

<b>[1893] Columbian Exhibition--Chicago</b><br>
"The great restaurant concession of the fair is held by A.S. Gage in the name of the Wellington Catering company and covers 137,800 square
feet of floor space. It also embraces privileges in all the buldings erected by the World's Columbian Exposition, sixteen in number,
as well as a supply depot to be erected by the company. The concession provides for three classes of eating places. The first 
will include the finest restaurants, with service equal in excellence to that maintianed in any hotel in this city. The second grade
will be on an equality wiith the the style of caravansary known as the popular restaurant, while the third takes in lunch-counters
and the buffet system, where cold meats sandwiches, hot coffee, pies, and cakes will be served. This class will be operated in the
building where the odors of a kitchen cannot be permitted to float around promiscuously among the exhibits and sightseers. These
counters and buffets, whowever, says Mr. Gage, will be as fine and supplied with just as good food as can be found anywhere. The total
space involved in this concession will be allotted to the different classes in these proportions: To the first 20 per cent, the 
second 40 per cent, and the third 40 per cent. Thes eating capacity at tables throughout the different buildings is estimated at 
12,000 and the lunch counters aggregating 7,500 feet, or one and one-half miles in length, 4,000 person may dine at one time. On
the supposition that this capacity can be changed five-times--and that is a low calculation--the Wellington will feed 80,000 people
a day. This number may be increased to 100,000 a day. The company will not only adopt its own standard, such as prevails now in the 
Wellington Hotel cafes down-town, but proposes to serve the best of wholesome food at each and every one of its places...In the 
general supply estimate something like fifty head of good-sized bullocks that will dress out 30,000 pounds of beef a day,w ith two
and a half tons of ham for sandwiches, will cover the meat demand. Sixty barrels of flour a day will be consumed in bread, pies, and 
cakes, with potatoes and other vegetables of all kinds in proportion. The quantity of milk that will be consumed is beyond the limit
of advance figures. The very finest restaurant to be conducted by this company will be located in the Administration building, and
it is understood it will be the best place on the grounds."<br>

"Restaurants and Dining-Rooms. Visitors who elect to stop at hotels and places in this vicinity of Jackson Park will find accomodations
provided to feed a multitude. Nearly all, if not all, of these hotels will be equipped with restaurants or dining-rooms. To them 
must be added the restaurants in the Fair Grounds, those on the Midway Plaisance, and the hundreds which will be opened in the 
district contiguous to Jackson Park. Visitors may have their choice among thirty-five places to dine in the grounds. The concession
held by the Wellington Catering company provides for three classes of restaurants.  The first will include restaurants of the 
highest rank, equal to any in the city. The second grade provides for what may be called popular restaurants, with prices on a 
lower scale. The third class takes in lunch counters and buffets where cold meats, sandwiches, pies, cakes and coffee will be
served. There will be one and one-half miles of lunch ounters. Among the larger restaurant are the Great White Horse Inn and the 
Columbian Casino. The first occupies a building which is a reproduction of the hostelry made famous by Dickens. It is located south of 
Machery Hall. The cooking will be strictly English. On the first floor of the inn anything from a ham sandwich to a $2 porterhouse 
steak will be sold. The second floor will be given up to the finest trade, and will be patterned after the best London clubs.
The Columbian Casino will occupy the Casion, a three-story building at the mouth of the lagoon. The first floor will be fitted
up with parlors, reception rooms, lavatories, and smoking rooms. On the second floor will be a public dining room, with tables and 
seats for 1,500 people...The "Clam Bake" will be one of the novelties at the Fair. A three-story building in the northern part of
the grounds is occupied for this affair. Old-fashioned New England clam bake dinners, it is stated will be served, as well as all sorts of
fish. There will be room for 2,500 people at one sitting. Within the World's Fair ground 59,400 people can dine at one time next
summer. Counting six changes of plates for each place at table 356,400 meals may be served every day in the Fair grounds. Dining
places on the Midway Plaisance will have accomodations for 16,000 people at one time. A vistor, among other places, may choose to
dine in the natorium--or in cafes overlooking the animals in Hageabeek's Zoological Garden, or in the Hungarian Orpheum, 
or in the Dutch settlement, the Polish cafe, or the Turkish village. He may be served with familiar viandes or may taste the food
of strange lands and be waited on by natives of these countries. If he is particularly exclusive he will find a lunch-room 1,200
feet above the earth in the captive baloon."<br>

If you want to recreate an authentic period dinner, we suggest you start by examining the recipes
offered in <a href="http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/html/books/book_45.cfm"> 
<i>Favorite Dishes: A Columbian Autograph Souvenir Cookery Book</i></a>, compiled by
Carrie V. Schuman. This book is a collection of recipes of Chicago's "leading ladies" in the early
1890s. The edition recently reprinted by the University Of Illinois Press (2001) contains scholarly
essays on both the fair and the book. 
<p>
If you want to feature some popular foods introduced at the Exposition this book suggests: 
"Cracker Jack, Cream of Wheat, Shredded Wheat, Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer and Wrigley's Juicy
Fruit Gum. Prominent, too, were Aunt Jemima (wth Nancy Green playing the eponymous cook)
and the H.J. Heinz Company's Sour Spiced Gherkins. It is said that a million visitors flocked to
Heinz's display, where they were given small "pickle pins." Conserves and pickles were serious
components of the American diet. Foods like these were industrial products made for mass
consumption. While some, such as Heinz pickles, were hand packed, foods were becoming
entirely industrialized, raised with farming machinery and artificial fertilizers and cooked and
packed in factories." (p. xl)

<b>[1900] Exposition Universelle Internationale--Paris</b><br>
Much is written about the foods of popular American expositions (St. Louis 1904 classic example); less so about fairs held in other countries. We also need to 
keep in mind our American news sources generally concentrate on USA foods, perhaps because that's what their readers are most interested in. 
Our survey of historic USA newspapers confirms the popularity of American fruit, corn, California wine, beefsteak and
 <a href="foodlobster.html#newberg">Lobster Newburg</a>. The article below 
describes the German pavilion restaurant was the overall favorite dining venue. The reporter does not mask his obvious distaste for German cuisine & restaurant 
service. It would be interesting to compare USA accounts with those published in French, German, and British newspapers. 
<p>
<b>Popular dishes </b><br>
"The efforts which foreign nations make to compare with France in the culinary domain are worthy of a good deal of attention. In Paris there are 
not a few establishments where meals of various kinds are prepared in exotic ways to suit foreign palates, but it is at the exposition that
 international cooking may be best examined and compared with the home industry. At the last exposition it was the Russian restaurant which 
won the highest approbation from the culinary wise and the pound foolish. On this occasion it is the Germans who seem to have struck the newest 
and most successful note. At any rate, the German 'weinstube' on the Qual des Nations is crowded even when other places are empty, and the 
Paris season being in full progress, great difficulty was encountered in getting a seat at any table. Personally I consider this success unwarranted,
 at least on such a scale. This luncheon and dinner seemed to me a very ordinary table d'hote of the monotonous Berlin type; the detestable 
German habit of sitting down at any vacant placer whether the table was partially occupied or not prevailed and the service had and irritating 
slowness and solemnity about it suggestive of a German chorale. The ubiquitous and centrifugal German waiter put on the air of a Prussian 
Corporal for the house and refused to understand any language but German. One of then even assured me in a Berlin accent that German cigars 
were superior to any in the world. The wine was good, but not unnecessarily expensive, and certainly not better than the German wines which can
 be procured at Cafe Anglais. The glasses in which they were served were pretty, of delicate form and tender hue, a little too small perhaps, but 
on the whole charming. Whether they were afraid of being prejudiced in their judgement or not I cannot say, but truly the French were remarkably
 uncritical in their appreciation of this place. They extended a similar approval to a vast German beer house where the Teuton reveled and roared
 all day long and late into the night, singing riotous choruses to two German bands which played all the National airs, and generally be conducted
 himself en maitre, with an assurance I had almost written arrogance, I had never dared to display in Paris for the past thirty years. This in fact 
was the harmony with that leading fact about the exposition-the conquest of Paris by the Germans. The Russians have had but little success with 
their culinary venture this time...The Chinese restaurant was picturesque by reason of the variegated architecture and its pig-tailed waiters, but 
the native cooking was altogether inferior. The bamboo shoots which I ate there were evidently canned, and as tough as bits of paper mache, 
while the sauce they were served in was ordinary palm oil, not caster oil with shrimps, ova, as it should have been. 
<p>
"American Dishes Popular. Nor have the English done very much to distinguish themselves. At the last exposition the English beefsteak was very 
much in evidence, and British ale flowed in torrents. This time it is the American beefsteak which carries of the palm or popularity, and as much 
may be said for American beer. For the first time, in fact, since my recollection. Parisians have had an opportunity of tying the choicest feature of 
the American culinary art in all perfection. I am aware that there are certain places in town where American dishes are advertised,as is also the 
case with specialties of British cuisine, but the same drawback attends them all. Sooner or later their proprietors are forced to fall back upon local 
cooks, and then the true traditions are falsified and the genuine style disappears. A French artist, for instance, cannot stop abroad for long with 
any sort of impunity. His style is certain to be vitiated sooner or later by his environment...For this, among other reasons, the Parisian gourmets of 
at least the vast majority of them, have been kept in almost complete ignorance of the extraordinary resources of the American cuisine...The 
American restaurant, beneath the American Pavilion, has attained to a great degree of popularity, and some of the most learned Parisian 
"forchettes" have expressed themselves to me delighted with the nouvelle they have discovered there and have expressed the hoe that an
 American restaurant in Paris on a permanent institution. They have admired particularly the American method, totally unknown to here, of eating 
an entire melon before a meal with the top sliced off, the seeds taken out and replaced by crushed ice. The 'gombo en gelee," an intense chicken
 consomme with the delicate flavor of the okra, served cold, filled them with admiration. I think their highest...praise was reserved for lobster a la 
Newburg. Lobster is so rare a crustacean in Paris, and few French cooks are in genuine sympathy with it or know how it should be treated...The
 Newburg sauce is the invention of a race of men who are in love with the sea. The American beefsteak was also a revolution to my gourmet
 friends. Anything more succulent or tender, they declared, in the way of a beefsteak, had never passed their lips...California Wines Praised. I
 have already referred to the great admiration generally called forth by the various brands of American beer, and the intelligent method adopted in 
icing it to exactly the right temperature. French beer is rarely well iced. The Commissioner for the State of California...has won not only golden 
opinions, but 'extraordinary number of golden medals for the wines produced by the State. A certain old California brandy was recognized as
 rivaling the best matured congacs. A combination of Benedictine and cream, known as 'night cap' made a great sensation when it first struck the
 palate of a well-known Parisian bonvivant a few days ago, and it is likely to be the most popular liqueur of the forthcoming season. One modest 
little culinary demonstration has in particular charmed everybody. It is that of the American corn exhibit. Here there is a series of counters served
 by an old darky, 'Chloe,' who comes from the best families in Maryland At the first counter you are served with American tomato soup, thickened
 with corn and beans. The 'Chloe' gives you corn cakes with maple syrup and beautify fresh butter, followed by blancmange with raspberry jelly, 
and grits with cream. And all these delicacies for nothing! No wonder that the Parisians call down blessings of Heaven on American cooks."<br>
---"Cooking of All Nations," <i>New York Times</i>, August 26, 1900 (p. 7) 
<p>
<b>American fruits </b><br>
"In view of the growing importance of the fruit industry and the prospective large commercial surplus of certain fruits, the Paris Exposition of 1900
 is deemed and excellent opportunity to acquaint European consumers with the beauty and general excellence of American fruit products. Under 
the act of Congress on July 1, 1898, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to prepare suitable exhibits of the agricultural products of the
 United States and Territories of the United States, including those mentioned in groups VII, VIII and X of the French classification (agriculture, 
horticulture and food products) the same to be exhibited under the control and direction of the Commissioner-General. Under this authority it is 
therefore proposed to make representative exhibits of American horticultural products, particularly of such as are obtainable in quantity and likely
 to be in demand abroad. Arrangements are being made for representative exhibits of canned, preserved and evaporated fruits, jellies, fruit juices,
 etc., as well as of canned vegetables, pickles and other prepared articles of horticultural origin. To call special attention to the great variety of
 fruits now procurable in the United States in quantities sufficient for the export trade, it is proposed to install and maintain during the entire 
period of the exposition a representative exhibit of American fresh fruits. To accomplish this it will be necessary to provide a supply of choice 
specimens of the more durable fruits, such as winter apples, pears, citrus fruits, cranberries, nuts, etc., of the 1899 season for display at the 
opening of the exposition and until specifics of the crop of the year 1900 are available. It is intended that all the more important fruit-growing 
districts of the United States shall be represented in this exhibit and the active cooperation of growers and other persons interested is solicited...
As to the kinds of fruits desired, only such varieties should be chosen as possess special merit as market, dessert or culinary fruits in the different 
section of the country. Special attention should be given to standard varieties that are likely to keep well and be adapted to the requirements of 
export trade."<br>---"Fruits at the Paris Exposition," <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, September 11, 1899 (p. 5) 
<p>
"The fresh fruit from Lost Angeles, Cal. for the exposition has been received in perfect condition, traveling 8000 miles and being rehandled in New 
York, Southampton and Havre. The consignment consists of lemons and oranges and amounts to tow carloads."<br>
---"Our Fruit in Paris," <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, May 27, 1900 (p. 12) 
<p>
<b>American prohibitionists have their say</b><br>
"The question of the Sunday opening of the American pavilion and section at the exposition had barely been settled when the temperance 
advocates lifted their voices against the sale of liquor in the cafe of the American pavilion. The basements of all the pavilions on the now famous
 Rue des Nations, where are erected the official buildings of the foreign nations, are occupied by restaurants and cafes in which are served dishes
 and beverages characteristic of the respective countries. The establishments look out on the Seine, and the terraces in front are becoming
 popular rendezvous for foreign visitors...The American prohibitionists feel very strongly in the matt of allowing the sale of liquor in the American 
cafe, which forms a part of their national pavilion. The open letter column of The Paris Herald offered and arena for a wordy warfare between the
 opponents of and the sympathizers with the sale of liquor, which has been highly interesting to Parisians, who utterly fail to comprehend how 
such a subject could form a topic of discussion. At the headquarters of the American Commission it is explained that those who have been 
vehemently assaulting the idea of an American bar are acting under false impressions, as no bar is to be located there. The cafe will be such as is 
found in all American cities. Distinctive American food can be had there, and American beverages will be served to those dining."<br>
---"Liquor at the Fair: Prohibitionists Object to its Sale in the American Pavilion," <i>New York Times</i>, May 13, 1900 (p. 7) 
<p>
<b>Electric kitchens</b><br> 
"The kitchen at the Paris Exposition illustrates what can be cone in labor saving, by the application of electricity to food-preparation on a large 
scale. Between three hundred and four hundred guests are cared for daily in the restaurant to which the kitchen is attached. The kitchen is
 equipped with highly elaborate electrical apparatus. The maximum current used is three hundred and fifty amperes at one hundred and ten volts. 
Of this, a large proportion is used in keeping hot coffee, tea, chocolate, and other hot drinks. About four times the quantity of current--it is put at 
about two hundred and eighty kilowatt hours--is utilized in cooking. The mean cost of the current for each guests served is about six cents. The 
electrical heating apparatus is of a French type, in which a metallic powder is mixed with various proportions of a non-conducting enamel, thus 
making blocks of high-resistance material, well adapted to develop heat under the application of the electric current. The eight heaters of the 
huge restaurant oven can be carried up to a temperature of 1200 degrees centigrade. Four of the plates absorb twenty-five amperes each, and 
four others twenty amperes each. There is also a roasting oven, which broils meats with heat from red hot plates. This apparatus absorbs 
thirty-five amperes. There are other smaller ovens all heated electrically. In one of these, seventy-five pounds of meat can be roasted in about 
three hours, with a mean intensity of current of forty amperes. Heated by the same current is a water boiler, and a thirty-quart soup kettle, as 
well as plate eaters and many other appliances."<br>---"Electrical Kitchen," <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, September 6, 1900 (p. I5) 
<p>
<b>Concessionaires & restauranteurs complained</b><br> 
"Most of the restaurant keepers in the other parts of the exposition--scarcely one of whom has but lost money on his concession--talk of joining
 the syndicate formed in the Champs de Mars quarter. These concessionaires paid half of their rentals for the season in advance, and signed 
agreements to pay the rest on June 15. The second payments have not yet been made...One of the grievances of the restaurant keepers is that
 the low price of tickets of admission to the exposition has resulted in bringing in a class of people too poor to spend any money, who carry their 
lunches and dinners in baskets, and eat on the grounds."<br>

Americans are fascinated with fair food, especially the items attributed to the 1904 St. Louis
Exposition. The truth? Most of these popular foods existed before the fair, and many have
several conflicting stories with regards to "true" origin. This makes the lore even more intriguing.
What these foods have in common is that they were mass marketed at the St. Louis fair. That is
why this year holds a special place in the American gastronomic chronology.

<b>[1915] Pan Pacific International Exposition--San Francisco CA</b><br>
Laura Ingalls Wilder was one of the many famous people attending this fair.
Her daughter Rose described their visits in a series of letters published in book form, <a href="http://www.sanfranciscomemories.com/ppie/LauraIngallsWilder.html"><i>West From Home</i></a>.
One of the foods Rose told us her mother enjoyed was "Pan-Pak."  Surely, if this item was notable enough for Rose to record, 
print evidence/description exists. 
<p>

To date, we have not discovered any other print reference to Pan-Pak. We have, however, found a recipe for Pan-Pacific from the
<i>Panama-Pacific Cook Book</i>, the "official" cookbook of the 1915 World's Fair:
<blockquote>
<b>417. Pan-Pacific</b><br>
Shred the breast of a boiled fowl into inch lengths. Cut three slices of pineapple into cubes. Remove the pulp of a fine alligator
pear with a teaspoon and the pulp from a grapefruit and an orange and a slice of banana, the hearts of four large artichokes, boiled 
until tender, and a cup of boiled asparagus tips. Mix all of these lightly together and add enough highly seasoned mayonnaise to 
blend; then chill in an ice-chest. Serve on a platter bordered with crisp lettuce and garnish with strips of pimiento and
ripe olives."<br>

"They're cooking with gas at the New York World's Fair...literally! A survey of restaurants and food service stands at the World's Fair shows that approximately 99 per cent of the cooking at the Fair will be done with gas. Most of the major restaurants at the Fair will use gas, as well as the 25 Brass rail food service stands which will be scattered throughout the fairgrounds...The Top of the Fair restaurant, located at the top of the New York Port Authority Heliport, is the first of all--gas restaurants to open at the Fair. From the Top of the Fair restaurant the 'Drinks around the World' cocktail lounge, just under the helicopter landing platform, diners will get a unique view of the Fairgrounds. Other restaurants at the Fair will include a variety of international and American cuisine, with many countries featuring national cooking within their pavilions. A total of 65 public restaurants catering to all tastes and budgets are scheduled to operate at the Fair. The Fair's Industrial Area will feature 13 major restaurants, accenting everything from gourmet American regional cooking at the Festival '64--'The American Restaurant' in the Festival of Gas pavilion to international sandwich specialties served at the Seven-Up pavilion. The International Area, which will highlight the traditional national foods of countries represented there, will feature 27 restaurants. Among the pavilions featuring restaurants are Hong Kong, Indonesia, International Plaza, Japan, Lebanon, Malaya, Pakistan and Spain. The Federal and State Area will feature 11 restaurants, highlighting such state foods as Maryland 'eastern shore dinners' and 'golden trout and baked ham' from West Virginia. In addition to Top of the Fair restaurant, the fair's Transportation Area will feature four other restaurants. The Century Grill will serve hamburger steaks prepared in accordance with recipes from nations around the world and foot-long American-styled hot dogs. The Greyhound pavilion will feature American regional food in dining rooms accenting a 'Main Street U.S.A.' theme. And two Brass Rail restaurants, part of the six which will be at the Fair in addition to the 25 food service stands, will feature Italian and American cooking. The Lake Amusement Area will have another 10 restaurants open to the public. Among these will be the Chun King pavilion where Fair visitors can enjoy a 7-variety Oriental dinner for 99 cents and the Texas pavilion where they dine in fie or six restaurants of different design and decor or a Western saloon featuring 'dance hall' entertainment. The Hawaii pavilion will feature both Hawaiian and Polynesian delicacies and special luau dinners ain a setting complete with gas burning Luau torches. Other restaurants of note at the Fair, each featuring special dishes, service or settings, include those in the Pavilion of American Interiors, the Better Living Pavilion, the Schaefer pavilion, and the World of Food."<br>

"A world of sights, sounds, smells and tastes awaits the World's fair visitor in the International Plaza. A fairgoer can arrive by 
air--a Swiss cable-car--and can, in a mere lunch hour, eat his way from Tunisia to the Orient to the Philippines to Belgium. The
plaza occupies only two acres of the fairgrounds, but more than two dozen foreign nations are represented there with unusal products
and culinary treats...Lunchtime aromas greeted them. For an appetizer, it was a toss-up between egg rolls form the new Orient or form Tunisia, where
they are called bricks. Munching on the Oriental variety, the visitors strolled into the San Miguiel lounge for a chaser of Philippine
beer and an American cheese sandwich. Around the corner, some Belgians were drawing the dessert crowd with bel-gem 
waffles. They are about four-by-eight
inches, and an inch thick, and are covered with whipped cream and fresh strawberries, topped with powdered sugar. To let his international
meal settle, the fairgoer can sit for his portrait at the Arista d'Italia, Inc., studio, and maybe sip a demitasse from the Brazilian
Coffee House."<br>

<b>Top of the Fair</b><br>
Top of the Fair Resturant, located in the elevated New York Port Authority structure just outside the offical fair grounds, was considered by some the crowning jewel
 of dining venues. Top of the Fair opened October 1963, six months prior to the fair, officially making it the first public building of the fair.
<p>
"The Top of the Fair, the official New York World's Fair restaurant and club atop the Port of New York Authority exhibit building, will
open Wednesday, some six months ahead of the official opening of the fair itself. The new dining center is operated by the Knott
Hotels Corporation. Seth Flewharty, vice president of Knott, said that the Top of the Fair is already booked weeks in advance by
many business and trade meetings and conventions as well as a number of charity balls. The restaurant will be open the year-round
and is expected to gross more than $5,000,000 for the two seasons of the fair."<br>

"Hordes of construction workers, interior decorators and broom pushers worked at a feverish pace yesterday in preparation 
for the official opening today of the first public building of the 1964-65 World's fair. The structure, the Port Authority's Heliport
and Exhibit Building, will be opened by Governor Rockefeller, Gov. Richard J. Hughes and City Council President Paul R. Screvane.
By Friday it will be ready for anyone desiring a look at progress being made by the fair, which is scheduled to open April 22. The
circular dining room and bars atop the building will also be open to the public, affording a view of hundreds of men working on the 
150 pavilions that eventually will constitute the fair...'We put the most important people here, is that right?' aksed one worker
yesterday in the Top of the Fair Restaurant, a dining room 100 feet or so (depending upon where one sits) above sea level, providing
enough room for 1,500 people...Despite the poshness of the restaurant, William Foley, its manager, said that diners with moderate
means would not find it overly expensive. 'We want to give elegance at moderate prices,' he said, adding that it was his desire to
run a family-type restaurant. However, ties would be required, he said. As for children he noted that he had six of his own--he said they
would be most welcome. Nonetheless, the restaurnt is making room for the affluent by setting off a glass-partitioned section of the
dining room called the Terrace Club. Anyone wishing to join can do so by  buying a two-year membership for $1,200....The restaurant's
decorators picked blue and gold as its dominant colors. At one bar, a large Rube Goldberg drawing entitled 'How to Cure World's Fair
Tired Feet' was hung. Near another bar was a picture of a Madonna and Child...The restaurant will be open from 11:30AM to 
10PM on Sundays through Thursdays and from 11:30AM to 2AM on Fridays and Saturdays."<br>

<b>Craig Claiborne's restaurant review</b><br>
"In several areas there is a noticeable ambivalence about the Top of the Fair, the first of numerous restaurants to oepn at th World's
Fairground in Flushing Meadows. The decor runs the gamut from hypermodernistic murals to antique tapestries, the service 
from sleek to 
so-so, and the food from excellent to middling. The restaurant is moderately expensive, but, in spite of certain vulgar aspcets, it is 
worth a visit by day or nigth if only for the beguiling view. In any world's fair enterprise, commercial overtones are 
inevitable. Taste would seem to involve the degree to which the commercialism is conspicuous. In the midst of neo-modern elegance at 
the Top of the Fair, there is a large counter that flourishes such gewgaws as T-shirts, key chains, paper weight sand pennants.
Menus may be purchased for $1 (they may not be otherwise retained) and there is a table-hopping cameraman always at the ready for 
taking the souvenir photo. The most garish note in the restaurant is struck by the bartender, garbed in a shimmering gold
outfit that resembles in design the uniform of a garage mechanic. It must be added in haste that the maitres d'hotel, captains
and waiters are handsomely turned out in traditional black and white. Both of the menus at the Top of the Fair are a la carte and dishes
that they list are generally interesting in concept. The menu is basically French, although there are occasional dishes of Greek origin,
such as Athenian style lamb. There is small doubt in this reviewer's mind that the chef is competent in his metier, although the 
quality of the food varies. Among several dishes sampled recently at the restaurant, one remembers with pleasure wonderfully 
sweet, fresh and tender oysters; and individual hot casserole of glazed sea food in a mornay sauce, and excellent liver. By contrast, 
there is the memory of a serving of assorted hors d'oeuvre with too much tomato, too much salami, too much beets and too little 
finesses. There was also a cold dish of crab ravigote, in which the crab was flecked from top to bottom with bits of shell or cartilage.
Any restaurant with style would serve whole lump crab beat or remove the item from the menu. Unless one palate is woefully wrong,
the crab was mixed with commercially prepared mayonnaise. The wine serve at a recent luncheon was both painful and, in its own 
way, humorous. The waiter brought to the table a bottle of white wine at room temperature and, when it was requested that the 
wine be chilled, he informed those gathered for the feast that, in Burgundy, white wine was never chilled. He could not have known 
that one of the gentlemen at the table was born Burgundian. The wine was subsequently iced, but it offered little comfort 
to the oysters. The cost of main luncheon courses at the Top of the Fair ranges from about $2.75 to $4; the cost of main dinner 
entrees is from $3 to $6.75. The restaurant is open ever day and there is supper dancing Friday and Saturday. The telephone number
is 888-5500."<br>

"The Top of the Fair is under the management of Restaurant Associates, Inc., which, in addition to operating the renowned Forum of the Twelve Caesars, Four Seasons and La Fonda del Sol in Manhattan, also operates the highly successful Festival '65, The American Restaurant in the Fair's Gas Pavilion. Top of the Fair, the official restaurant of the New York World's Fair, is atop the Port Authority Heliport. It is one of the few operations to be continued after the Fair closes in October, and is building a reputation as a family restaurant for Manhattan and Long Island residents. The restaurant is accessible both to visitors to the Fairgrounds and touring diners who are looking for something different in the way of atmosphere and fine food at luncheon and dinner. (It is outside the Fair gates, but if you're inside, you can get a re-entry pass.) Two walls of glass afford a panoramic view, looking down, of many of the Fair's attractions; looking up, the diner sees the gaily painted helicopters of the New York Port Authority coming in or taking off from the roof overhead. There's good news, too. If you simply arrive by car; free parking is available adjacent to the restaurant. Menu prices are lower than they were during the Top of the Fair's first season. A complete luncheon, served from 12 noon on, may be had for as little as $2.95, and includes appetizer, entree, dessert and beverage. Dinners, served from 5:30 p.m. on, are complete, and range form $4.95 for stuffed baby flounder to $6.95 for roast prime ribs of beef. Prices for children's dinners are $1.00 or less. The spacious dining area, seating 500 people, is decorated in lively blue, tangerine and white. The blue walls and carpet, the tangerine leather upholstered chairs and offset by oyster-white pillars and glittering chandeliers. Guitar and piano music make a melodious backdrop for dinnertime conversation, and there is dancing in the evening in the Capsule Bar. One of the highlights is the installation of a Marketplace Buffet which includes a fresh vegetable stand and a pastry shop with a chef at work. Diners can imagine themselves strolling in the open marketplaces of Paris, pausing at the colorful vegetable stands 
displaying the day's fresh produce, stopped by the fragrance and tantalizing appearance of the mouth-watering concoctions arrayed in a pastry shop. Much of the 
pleasure of eating is in the eye of the beholder and diners may see in the Marketplace some of the tempting selections offered on the menu. In addition to the freshest
vegetables, the most delicate and delicious pastries a variety of meats, fish, and poultry are served at the Top of the Fair. The kitchen, under the irection of famed chef 
Albert Stockli, produces such succulent meat dishes as Roast Filet of Beef, Perigourdine, for which the recipe follows.<br>
<b>Roast Filet of Beef, Periogourdine</b><br>
4 to 4 1/2 pounds filet of beef. Remove fat an connective tissue from beef. Place beef on rack in shallow roasting pan. Tuck narrow end under to make roast uniformly thick. Roast 
in 450 degrees F. oven 45 minutes. Serve with Perigourdine Sauce. Yield: 6 servings.<br>
<b>Periogourdine Sauce</b><br>
2 cups veal, pot roast or canned beef gravy<br>
1/2 cup Madeira wine<bbr>
2 tablespoons brandy<br>
1 can (4 1/2 ounces) back truffles, chopped<br>
6 tablespoons firm butter<br>
Salt and pepper to taste, optional<br>
Put gravy into a saucepan; stir in wine and brady. Add chopped truffles and liquid from can... Bring to boil; reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes. Add butter, one tablespoon at
a time, stirring until each tablespoon butter is melted. If desired, season to taste with salt and pepper."<br>

"There are no reservations for tables at the Top of the Fair Restaurant, high up in the New York Port Authority Building. And the lines are long! But if you are 
slightly patient and lucky, you will be on hand at nine of an evening to watch the fireworks through the vast glass walls. After having partaken ecstatically of a baked coquille of seafood, perhaps, and maybe, the bombe of three ice creams, served with a sauce of blueberries, bewitched with spice and citrus peel! Easy to reproduce back home are these recipes given to us by Executive Chef Charles Pepchakis, who received the secrets of his trade, and practices the culinary arts handed down to him by his forefathers. Charles is the fourth great chef in his family. His grandfather Nicholas was in charge of the royal kitchens of King Constantine of Greece. His great grandfather was a combination butcher-chef in some of the finest eating places of Paris and Greece. His father was the renowned Chef John of the St. Moritz--darling of visiting royalty.

<b>Baked Coquille of Seafood</b><br>
To serve 6, you should have on hand, 4 cups of cooked or canned and drained seafood. Chef Charles likes to use 1 cup each lobster meat, Alaska king crab, scallops and shrimp. Place the seafood in a frying pan along with 1/2 cup white wine, 3/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, 1/2 teaspoon paprika. Heat. Place on a shallow, ovenproof dish, which can go to the table.(Chef Charles uses a shell-shaped dish, hence the name). Blend in 2 cups canned or homemade cream sauce combined with 1/3 cup prepared Hollandaise sauce. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan. Bake at 375 degrees about 10 minutes or until hot and bubbly.
<br>
<b>Around the World Pilaf</b><br>
...This is a quick version of the pilaf so popular in Chef Charles' native land of Greece. Bring to a boil 2 cups consomme or bouillion, 2 tablespoons butter, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/8 teaspoon white pepper. Add 1 cup rice. Stir well. Cover and allow to cook slowly about 20 minutes or until done. Add 1 more tablespoon butter, broken into little bits, and fluff with a fork. 
<br>
<b>Frozen Green Beans with Almonds</b><br>
...The combination now comes frozen ready to heat.
<br>
<b>Top of the Fair Bomb</b><br>
...To serve 6, you will need 12/3 pint each of strawberry, vanilla and chocolate ice cream. Rinse a melon mold with cold water, slightly soften the ice cream. Cover the inside of the mold with strawberry ice cream. Add the vanilla and place a bit of the chocolate in the center. Smooth the top. Keep in the freezer until serving time. Unmold and decorate with sweetened whipped cream.
<br>
<b>Chef Charles' Own Blueberry Sauce</b><br>
...To 2 cups briefly cooked or canned blueberries, add a 2-inch strip of lemon peel and the same amount of orange peel, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 2 or 3 whole cloves. Simmer 3 minutes. Serve warm."<br>

<b>Move theater concessions	</b><p>
What kind of food was offered at movie theater concesssion stands in the
1920s? The answer is: nothing.
<p>
We seached dozens of interior shots of early 20th century theaters and found no references to
concessions or any other food-selling activities. The Great Depression changed that. <a href="restaurants.html#moviepopcorn">Popcorn</a> was grudgingly adopted by 
movie
owners. Theater concessions, we know them today,
were introduced in the 1940s.  No doubt, like today, some people snuck food in.
<p>
"Because concession stands didn't exist until the 1940s, all around each theater there was a cluster of
lunch counters, ice cream parlors and candy stores a whole thriving ecosystem of urban gathering
places, with the theater at its heart," reported the [Boston] Globe."

<p>
<b>Why were foods sold in theatres?</b><br>
"Satisfying the sweet tooth of American moviegoers has zoomed into a multi-million dollar sideline business for theatres, with sales
of popcorn, candy, ice cream and soft drinks now totalling about $500,000,000 a year, according to figures compiled by the 
concession commmittee of the Theatre Owners of America. Incidentally, the National Theatres circuit...will sell $4,000,000 worth
of popcorn this year."<br>
---"Big Business," <i>New York Times</i>, October 2, 1949 (p. X5)
<p>
<b>Drive-in theatres, doubling as amusement parks, sold foods similar to baseball stadiums.</b><br>
"From its novelty state of just a few years ago the drive-in theatre has mushroomed into a multi-million dollar outlet for the 
exhibition of motion pictures...But the convenience is beginning to take on other meanings too as the drive-in operators step up
public services...Nor have tose extra lures for the kiddie trade been overlooked. Pony rides and toy train raides, swings, see-saws,
carousels and other amusements are offered in a large number of drive-ins as before-the-show attractions. These accomodations serve
another purpose, too. By bringing the family groups out an hour or so before showtime the candy, ice cream, popcorn, soda, coffee,
hotdog and hamburger stands, among other concessions, do a thriving business. According to reports, it is not unusual for 
receitps from these enterprises to range in amount from 40 to 60 per cent of the gross box office revenues."<br>
---"Movie Novelty Develops into Big Business," Thomas M. Pryor, <i>New York Times</i>, September 4, 1949 (p. 47)
<p>
<b>Concessions are winners at double-features.</b><br>"The only one apparantly still profiting by the double reature is the exhibitor--he sells more popcorn, soda, candy and ice cream 
via the double gill. It was brough out at the Senate Small Business Committee hearings in Washington that the concession business done
by theatres in 1951 resulted in gross sales of approximately $506,000,000."<br>

<b>Food sales keep theaters open.</b><br>
"At the trade show of the National Association of Theater Owners...there was also a choice of Odell's butter, Durkee Pop-all,
Super Gold, Bee-Hive, Flavacol and Pop-Top to pour over the popcorn...This trad show takes such products very seriously. That's
because approximately $750 million will be spent at movie-theater concession stands this year...'Without concessions, no hteater
could remain in business.'...Approximately 65 cents of every doall that comes into the concession stand is profit...Because
candy is a lower profit item than either drinks or popcorn, the space for candy at concession stands is shrinking...The competition
for the 19 percent reamining of concession-stand sales includes candy, ice-cream, nachos, hot dogs, burritos, T-shirts, lobby 
video games and--the newest competitor--framed paintings."<br>

<a name="moviepopcorn">
<b>Popcorn goes to the movies</b>
<br>
"An extraordinary influence on popcorn's history was its shotgun wedding to movie theaters...During the 1920s
the motion picture industry had emerged with large studios and chains of theatres...By 1930 movie attendance reached 90 million patrson
per week. This huge audience was potentially a prime target for popcorn sales, but movie owners refused to sell it. To some owners, vending all
concessions was an unnecessary nuisance or "beneath their dignity." In the rowdy burlesque days hawkers went through the aisles
with baskets selling Cracker Jack and popcorn. Much of the popcorn was tossed in the the air or strewn on the floors. In addition
popcorn sellers were often slovenly dressed and did not always follow the most hygienic practices preferred by the middle classes who
frequented theaters. These were not the images most owners wanted to cultivate for their upscale theaters. Other owners considered the 
profits on concession sales to be negligible compared with the trouble and expense of cleaning up spilled popcorn and scattered boxes and
sacks. Many move theaters had carpeted their lobbies with valuable rugs to emulate the grand theater lobbies. Operates were not
interested in having their expensive carpets destroyed by spilled popped kernels, soda pop, and other confections. Finally, most theaters did not
have outside vents. Early popcorn machines filled theaters with an unpleasant, penetrating smoky odor. Owners interested in 
selling popcorn were required to construct vents, which ran up the expenses and reduced profits. Even when owners were willing
to do this, fire laws in some cities prevented the popping of corn without further extensive remodeling. Until the 1930s most theater
owners considered popcorn to be a liability rather than an asset. Theater owners shifted their perspectives dramatically during the
Depression. At five or ten cents a bag, popcorn was an affordable luxury for most Americans. Unlike most other confections, 
popcorn sales increased throughout the Depression. A major reason for this increase was the introduction of popcorn into movie theaters. 
At first independent concessionares leased "lobby privileges" in theaters. Vendors paid about a dollar a day for the right to
sell popcron. As many theaters did not have lobby space and most did not want the popcorn or smoke inside, operators leased vendors
space outside the theaters. This suited the vendors for they were able to sell both to movie patrons and passersby on the
street. This was a lucrative business during the Depression. When an Oklahoma banker went bankrupt during the Depression, he set himself
up with a popcorn machine in the little store near a theater. He made enough money in a few years to buy back three farms he had lost
in the bank failure...Soon popcorn entered the theater. In part this change was effected in a roundabout way by popcorn
machine salesmen. As a matter of tactics, salesmen made special efforts to sell poppers to stores near theaters. When theater owners
saw their costomers entering with popcorn bags, they quickly saw the light...Independent movie theaters were the first to capitulate
to popcorn's financial allure...As soon as machines were placed in the lobbies, business picked up."<br>
---<i>Popped Culture: A Social History of Popcorn in America</i>, Andrew F. Smith [Smithsonian Press:Washington] 2001 (p. 99-102)
<p>

"Movies had prospered without popcorn until the Great Depression, when theater owners scrambled to make up for reduced ticket 
prices by turning to "audible edibles." The appetite of moviegoers was so great that from 1934 to 1940, the nation's annual popcorn
harvest grew from 5 million to 100 million pounds. Marty Winter...recalled that Mr. Rubin was popcorn being made in Oklahoma City
on a visit around 1930 and started selling it a concessions he contrlled when he returned to New York. But Mr. Rubin's duaghter and 
a other longtime business colleague, Carl Levine, said it was not unitl the early 1950's that Mr. Rubin began to sell popcorn in a 
major way. At the time, his company...had the refreshments concessions for major movie chains in the New York metropolitan
area, including RKO, Brandt and Lowes. Andrew F. Smith, the author of "Popped Culture: The Social History of Popcorn in America," said
New York theaters were among the last to embrace popcorn, because it had a small profit margin, popping machines were a fire hazard
and the snack seemed a bit delcasse...Mr. Smith said that popcorn was being sold in some New York 1940s...At [age] 12, [Mr. Rubin] went to
work for Lazar, Stein & Landsman, ABC's  predecessor company, filling vending machines in movie theater, which did not yet have
concession stands. When a vending machine rolled and broke against the stage, he used it as a counter to sell candy, a precursor
of the modern movie concession stand. Over his conccession career, Mr. Rubin...developed movie-size candy bars and boxes, which 
could be sold for $1.50 instead of 35 cents."<br>

<b>Ancient Roman Colosseum fare</b><br>
What did the spectators munch while watching events (chariot races, sports contests, circus, etc.) in the Colosseum?
  <p>
  "The most varied and the most typically Roman of entertainments were the Games. These
  were at first presented in the old Circuit Flaminius and the later Circus Maximus. Long
  and straight, these had been designed for the chariot races that were a part of Roman life
  for hundreds of years...In due course, vast, circular open theatres were built specifically
  for the Games. There was Nero's wooden Ampitheatrum of AD 57...so called because its
  oval shape resembled a double theatre entirely surrounding the stage...The Emperor's box
  commanded the arena, and the front rows reserved for upper ranks...had unrivaled views,
  but visibility was excellent even from the  wedges of seats rising skywards. Comfort was
  limited: you took your own cushion; in fact chopped reed was called tomentum circense
   'circus stuffing'. If you were wise, you took some refreshment too,  like the eques,
  drinking during the show, to whom Augustus sent down a message:  "I go home when I
  want to have a meal." "Because you needn't worry about losing your seat," said the
  eques'...The Games brought many citizens...together for a whole day or for days on end,
  drunk with wine, sated with beauty, and with thrills and with blood, galvanized by the
  roars and applause that could be heard all over the city and well beyond.
       With childlike enthusiasm Statius tells us of the Saturnalia entertainment arranged for
  a temporarily grateful citizenry by Emperor Domitian:
<p>
  
  "Off with you, father Phoebus, stern Pallas, and all the Muses: you're on holiday. We'll
  want you back on the first of January. Saturn, loose your fetters. Come here you three,
  Drunk December, rude Fun, indecent Joke! Help me tell about the fine day and the
  bibilous night that our cheerful Caesar arranged for us.
       Scarce had Dawn got out of bed when sweets began to rain down on us, a rare dew
  distilled by the rising East Wind. The finest harvest of the hazel orchards of the Pontus
  and of the fertile hills of Idume, all that devour Damascus grows on its boughs, all that
  thirsty Cunus dries, all fell in profusion: there was a veritable shower of little cheeses and
  fritters, Amerines not too smoked, must-cakes, and enormous caryotis dates form
  invisible palms...A second  audience, at least as good-looking and well-dressed as we
  who were sitting down, now threaded its way along every row. Some carried baskets of
  bread and white napkins and more elaborate delicacies; others served languorous wine in
  brimming measure: you would think each one a divine cupbearer from Mount Ida. The
  same table served every class alike, child, woman, plebs, eques and senator: freedom had
  loosed the bonds of awe. You yourself--most gods could not have managed this!--you,
  Caesar, condescended to share our feast.""<br>

<b>Vending machines</b><br>
Americans are conflicted when it comes to vending machines. Automated food dispensers have been regarded as "wave of the future," 
"better than personal service," "hygenic," and "evil purveyors of junk food to our children." Vending machine 
manufacturers are truly an inventive group. <a href="restaurants.html#automats">Automats</a> took the vending industry to the next level.
<p>
<b>When was the first USA vending machine introduced & what did it sell?</b><br>
"The first American vending machine appeared in 1888, when the Thomas Adams Gum Company (American Chickle, Pfizer) placed 
a machine selling Tutti-Fruitti chewing gum on a platform of the elevated train in New York City. The following year, a penny 
vending machine was developed that could dispense handfuls fo candy and peanuts. Round, bubble-topped penny gumball machines were introduced in 1907. Because vending machines were still quite unreliable, most sold only penny items until the 1920s. One exception was the Horn and Hardart Baking Company, which opened the first coin-operated Automat restaurant in Philadelphia in 1902...In 1908 the Public Cup Vendor Corporation (Dixie Cup Company), devised a machine that served cooled water in a paper cup for a penny..."Sodamats," forerunners of the modern soda machine, were installed in amusement parks in 1926...In the 1930s vending machines began to offer a variety of candy bars. Movie theatres, popular sites for candy machines, displayed large, ornately designed versions. In 1935 the first cup-type soft-drink vending machine was made by Vendrink Corporation...and Coca-Cola introduced the first standardized coin-operated bottled soda machines selling nickel Cokes...Refrigerated machines were perfected in the 1950s. The War Production Board stopped the production of vending machines in 1942 because of the need for metal to support the war effort. Still, vending machines sustained the war effort, feeding factory workers during their long shifts, which led to the later acceptance of vending machines in the workplace. By 1960 some companies and schools and colleges abandoned their cafeterias and replaced them with banks of less expensive vending machines. Sandwiches, desserts, hot coffee, and soup created a growing market in factories and plants...The period also saw the introduction of machines that exchanged coins for dollar bills...Hot coffee machines were invented in 1945 and remained unchanged until the 1980s, 
when new innovations allowed coffee beans to be ground within the machine, as needed. This innovation produced the 1990s explosion of gourmet coffee and espresso machines."

<b>A selected survey of American vending machine developments:</b>
<br>
<b>[1891]</b><br>
"The now popular on omnipresent "nickel-in-the-slot machine" has only come into practical use within the past four years, although the idea is 2,000 years old. Four years ago this class of apparatus was entirely unckown as far as commercial purposes were concerned. Up to the beginning of 1888 only forty patents had been issued in this country governing such devices. The principal upon which the earlier machines were constructed is at least 2,000 years old. The device was employed by the priests of Alexandria, Egypt, for selling 'lustral' or purifying water to their parishioners. The apparatus was so arranged that upon the dropping of a coin into a slot it would fall on a lever which would raise a valve and thus allow the water to flow out. As soon as the coin fell off the lever the valve would reseat itself and the flow be stopped until another coin was deposited. The device was very simple, and if it worked successfully it was a monument to the honesty and stupidity of the ancient Egyptians, as the average street urchin of to-day would have found a way to "beat" this machine in five minutes. Since 1888 there have been about 4000 patents issued for these machines, which have been classed under the head of "coin-controlled apparatus," and this class has been divided into twenty-four sub-classes. About the same number of patents have been issued in England and a large number in Germany. Almost everything can now be obtained from these automatic clerks or, waiters. A person can drop a coin, either a penny or a nickel, in a slot and procure a cigar, cigarette, or piece of candy, or have his boots blacked, see a horse race, game of baseball, or get a glass of soda, lemonade, mineral water, a cup of tea, a cup of coffee, or have a spray of perfume thrown over his handkerchief, and send a telephonic message, ascertain his striking capacity, test his lungs, get a postal card, a postage stamp, a newspaper, borrow an opera glass, a fan, a book, set a phonograph in motion and "hear the band play," and do a hundred other things "too numerous to mention." The first patent of a machine bearing any similitude to those now in use was granted in England in 1839. This device was intended to prevent the use of seats in public vehicles without paying fare...An English patent was granted in 1870 entitled a "vending machine," which was intended to be used in selling various articles."

"New Yorkers learned recently that they had put a total of eight million dollars into subway vending machines during the last year, in exchange for candy, peanuts, chewing gum, cigarettes, carbonated drinks and a variety of other edible, nonedible and inedible commodities. They have also put in a great deal of physical and mental effort aimed at deceiving and punishing the machines, presumable in exhange for certain inner satisfactions...[Vending machines] serve a substantial, though somewhat limited, workingman's lunch or snack in the form of soups, sandwiches, cakes, pastry and hot and cold drinks. It also serves fare accepable to ducks, yaks, antelopes, chickens and such simple forms of animal life; the Bronx Zoo, for example, has machines selling cellophane-wrapped packages of bird-and-beast goodies, and ice-cream and pop corn machines are legion. A coin in a slot buys a tin of snuff, a picket comb, a dosage of sun-tan lotion or a one-shop dental kit, including a disposable toothbrush, a vial of toothpaste and a snack-sized length of dental floss...Recently, the robots have joined ranks and set out to conquer new and broader commercial fields, replacing not only the man behind the shop counter but the counter itself, and even the shop. Rows of monsterous, coin-operated refrigerators, combining the design of a restrained juke-box with the architecture of a bank vault, have been installed in apartment houses to compete with the milkman and the grocery store's dairy department...The late-mode vender is a dazzling thing of artfully chsen colors, sleek outlines, and trimmings of illuminated glass and plastic. It looks neat, efficient, and sanitary enough to meet the requirements of a hospital waiting room--qualities which have a decided attraction to almost anyone who has ever had to sort out his morning cup of coffee from the elbow-deep litter of a midtown luncheonette counter. Consciously or not, the public also has been influenced by the machine's ability to produce, at a price sometimes lower than that of a simlar item sold over the conventional store counter, a product of uniform quality, not subject to the haste, whimsy, fallibility or malice of a clerk or counterman."

"Retail selling without sales clerks is ringing up new gains. This year Americans will drop an expected $1.2 billion into vending machines, double the amount of 1946...The coin-droppers are plunging more money into such mechanical salesmen standbys as cigarettes, peanut and chewing gum machines. And they're also buying from machines such varied merchandise as lighter fluid, postcards, hosiery, and magazines. Among the latest mechanical salesmen is a machine that offers four kinds of refrigerated fresh fruit and can serve four customers at once. Then there's the miniature version of the Automat, dubbed the Lunch-o-Mat. It sells the eater-on-the-run hot and cold sandwiches, pie, pastry, milk, fruit juice and coffee...Besides the usual stress on things for on-the-spot consumption, vending mahcines are making abigger play for the take-home market...Behind the rise of vending machines, of course, is the rise in the cost of retail sales help. The average wage of the human salesperson climbed, by Government calculation, from about $1 an hour, on the average in 1947, to $1.32 last July...The opening-up of new markets in factories and on military posts has contributed heavily to the advance of the mechanical salseman."

"In the rapid expansion of automatic merchandising, the dispensing of hot foods in plants, schools, and many other areas of activity has been one of the major developments...The American fondness for snacks is responsible for the largest segment of the automatic merchandising industry. Greatest growth has been in the hot food end of this phase of merchandising. Much of the growth for the immediate future also hinges on further developments in machines to dispense complete hot meals. First introduced in 1955, many have already been expanded into complete automatic cafeterias...The impact has been felt throughout the food field. Candy manufacturers turn out a good share of their production in special sizes, shapes, and packs for machines. Confectionery and pastry houses have developed special nickel and dime pies, cakes, cookie and cracker packs, and other pastries. The packaging industry has been called on for special wraps, boxes, and sacks that can be adapated to machines. There are hot meal vendors for foods such as Swiss steak, chicken a la king, beef stew, spaghetti and meat balls, macaroni and cheese, meat and chicken pies, and baked beans. One firm now has 27 hot foods which are sold from an automatic cafeteria that takes up little more space than the average soft drink machine. There's the endless choice of soups from a soup bar. There are also special vendors for fresh, crisp salads, multiselection machines for hot and cold beverages and hot soups, and for a wide choice of sandwiches. There are special machines for parties and other desserts. It is possible to buy a freshly roasted hot dog, served in a roll, complete with sealed portion of mustard...One of the newest and most complex machines serves a complete meal from appetizer to dessert in a matter of seconds...Most of these hot food machines are installed in factories, schools, and military establishments. Eight out of 10 manufacturing plants use vending machines to help solve the problem of factory feeding...Such installations save capital investments, as well as the cost of operating regular cafeterias...They also provide round-the-clock feeding to take care of night shifts. In many plants, profits form the machiens are used for employee welfare and recreational funds. This encourages use of the machines and discourages abuse and pilfering. One plant uses commissions to buy uniforms and equipemnt for athletic teams...The RCA Victor TV division plant in Bloomington, Ind., uses automatic machines to feed 4,000 chips, pretzels, and other foods. Cooky sales have beenfound to increase reapidly when installed beside beverage machines...The Pennsylvania Railroad has an automatic snack bar to supplement dining-car service in some trains..."

One out of every five candy bars and packs of cigarettes is peddled through vending machines. There are 150 companies installing and servicing the automatic merchandising equipment, but close to half of the business is in the hands of three giants, all with national operations...It is an industry in revolution. There is the technological revolution, touched off a decade ago with perfection of automtatic coffee-peddling machines. There is the financial revolution, as big firms get bigger and small ones struggle for survival...And there is the revolution of service, as vending machines offer more and better general food service to the point that automatic cafeterias are not far in the future."

""We belive that there is a big future in the field of automatic merchandising and that this concern is in a position to benefit form such developments," At a time when vending machine securities have become top speculative favorites, this quotation from an investment advisory service sounds as contemporary as a Kennedy headline. And yet it was written in 1920. The concern reviewed, Autosales Co., went out of business in the mid-1930s. It seves to point up the classic differentiation betwen invention and innovation by Joseph Schumpeter, the late Harvard economist, and the frequently great time lag between the two. Vending machines...are hardly new although the stock market currently acts as though they were. The automatic merchandising industry is now celebrating its 75th anniversary. The first patents were granted in 1886 and two years later machines were already installed in New York's elebated train stations. Machines dispensing gum, candy, cigarettes--and more recently, soft drinks and coffee--have become commonplace. And yet the automatic merchandising industry feels it has hardly begun to tap its potential. Why has such a promising industry take to long to grow up?..For one thing, the early vending machines were relatively simple devices, But only until recently has technology been able to broaden their applications to take them out of the subway gum and candy rut....[the] vending equipemnt is essentialy labor-saving machinery. Scarcely had an automatic merchandising boom gotten underway in the 1920s when the Great Depression turned a labor shortage into a surplus, and "wage rates turned down, lessening the pressure to replace retail clerks with machines." Thre wasn't much point in putting a nickel into a slot for an apple when one could be bought on any street corner. Today, the trend has again been reversed. The labor supply has tightened and retail labor costs have mounted...Hence the present drive to replace the retail clerk with a machine. Vending equipment has been developed to recognize and change currency up to $20 bills, to handle race track bets, to dispence movie tickets, phonograph records, ice cubes, hot meals and what have you. Since June...Macy's New York store has been testing a machine which sells 36 different items of men's underwear ad shirts. The lease charge averages 20 cents an hour on a round-the-clock basis against an average of well over $1 an hour for a sales clerk. Automation has already invaded in-plant feeding, a $4 billion industry in itself. In Kansas City, a recently opened vending drive-in bult like a carport offers prepared foods, beverages and staple grocery items 24 hours a day from 24 machines."

"Each day Americans drop and estimated 111 million coins into vending machines to buy such items as cigarettes, candy, chewing gum, milk, soft drinks, nuts, ice cream and sandwiches. Last year the clinking of nickles, dimes and quarters added up to a sales volume of more than $4.5 billion. This year the projected sales value is $4.9 billion, an increase of 8 per cent. The American vending industry is expanding in what has been called its "third evolution" since World War II by establishing itself as a significant retailing channel and providing service to such new outlets as factories, offices and colletes. The "second evolution," in the priod between 1959 and 1961, led consolidations of vending mahcine manufacturers and service companies. This resulted in the establishment of national service concerns and public ownership of the largest service companies. The "third evolution" is palcing a majority of vending machines into new avenues of operation...the extent of this change was disclosed in two surveys of the industury, sponsored by the N.A.M.A...."An increasing variety of convenience foods will be available and purchased by smaller service firms who can thus cut down on production costs,"...The application of computers will have an important impact on the future of the vending business..."

Despite competition from candy and soft drink machines, the apple vendors "do a really big business," says Prof. Robert Smock, of Cornells' Pomology Department...Of coruse the fruit business is just a drop in the bucket for an industry with total annual sales of more than $4 billion. Sugar-laden snacks like candy bars, cookies, crackers, soda, and ice cream are where the money is in automatic food vending. That's why Mrs. Jean Farmer of Bloomington, Ind. became so alarmed when vending machines appeared at local schools....Vending machines are not evils, she says, nor are the people who operate them. But especially in schools, they need to be stocked with wholesome foods..."The only profit we should consider...is the lasting profit of good health and good habits."

"It is not hard to see the flaws in vending machines. They swallow money and never return it. They promise to drop a package of candy but freeze in mid-moment, cruelly dangling something that cannot be reached. They offer food that is appealing only to the desperate. But there are visions of what a vending machine can be: a quick, easy way to get fresh, nutritious food, valued not as a last-ditch choice but as an appealing alternative. There is a growing belief in the food industry that the next few years will witness the transformation of vending from a static, change-resistant business into one that will provide food anywhere people happen to be...Some of ther first tentative signs of change are already being spotted: vending machines that grind coffee from beans and brew a fresh cup...and systems that use debit cards rather than coins that do not function or coins that mysteriously disappear...This fall E.C.C. International Corporation...will begin selling vending machines that offer frozen foods that can be bought and then heated in a microwave oven. And Ore-Ida Foods...plans to begin production soon of a manchine that cooks french fries with hot air..."There are a lot of interesting machines coming,"...Although radical changes could take years to establish, there are several reason to believe that they are likely to occur. Vending has long been a dormant area of the food business which is constantly seeking new areas to exploit. Now, executives at large companies say vending has become a priority...Changes in the economy are also creating a demand for better vending in more places. The shrinking of large companies has led to the closing of many company cafeterias. They are being replaced with vending areas...Vending has been slow to change partly because the business for years could depend on what it called the four C's: cold drinks, candy, confections and cigarettes. Most of the items were small and and easy to buy with a coin or two. Now, the smallest candy bar seems to take a pocketful of change, which discourages purchases...It is not clear to all operators of vending machines...that their future lies in dispensing meals, rather than snacks or candy...The perceptions affect what people are willing to pay and buy. "We are still looked at strictly as a convenience and not as a food source,"..."People don't expect to go to a vending machine and buy steak and a baked potato."...They expect to pay less than they would for the same item bought in a grocery store...Meeting the needs of vending customers...is not easy. People are extremely impatient even in stores...They are at least as demanding when it comes to being served by a machine...Mollie Little...is the kind of customer the vending industry is trying to lure. She often takes her lunch to work, but said that she would buy from a machine if she could get good sandwiches, salads or entrees from companies like Weight Watchers or Lean Cuisine. Now, though, she sticks to buing soda or trail mix because she does not like the sandwiches from the machines...."the bread was soggy.""

"When traiteur in the 1780s added "restauranteur" to his sign, he probably began to serve some sort of bouillon, but he also, if it all possible, made provisions for
 more particularized repasts, for service a la carte. The restaurant made it possible, for the first time, to partake of a meal in the company of others without actually
 sharing provisions. In 1794, one would-be restauranteur identified serving single portions as a rare new talent, and thus advertised specifically for a cook who 
know how to "carve dishes for a-la-carte service" and price single servings. Yet if restauranteurs and their kitchen staffs knew that restaurant service was intended
 for individuals, their novice customers might not, and so menus throughout the 1790s carried reminders in large and boldface type informing eaters that prices listed 
were for single servings only. Restauranteurs had printed menus because the offered their customers a choice of unseen dishes...the restauranteur's printed menu 
made standardized transactions possible in a time when printed prices or fixed charges were still far from the norm in most shops or markets...While a restaurant's 
fare might not be uniform...its monetary transactions were...the printed menu allowed restaurant patrons to calculate costs 'before spending a penny...
There in print, set and fixed before his or her very eyes, the [a la carte] restaurant customer saw prices and dish names, concoctions and costs. No longer required 
to share each of the dishes brought to a table d'hote, but permitted to concentrate on the ones he or she explicitly requested, the restaurant patron could make a 
preference as much as a matter of finance as of taste......The rejection of the table-d'hote tradition indicated far more than a move toward flexible mealtimes and 
away from shared provisions; the restaurant also altered the relation between provider and customer...The table d'hote had literally been "the host's table'...The 
restauranteur offered a different sort of hospitality: he promised to provide each customer, with his or her or their...own table..."Restaurant" service--as unlike the 
cafe as it was distinct form the table d'hote--characterized not commonwealth but compartmentalization, a world of dividing partitions and individual isolation..."

<b>Ladies menus</b><br>

Restaurant history sources suggest giving women (accompanying men) menus without prices is a 
traditional haute cuisine "Old world" custom. Most notably, French. None of them provide details regarding the origin and evolution of the "Ladies' Menu." 
The practice is indeed intriguing. The origins, elusive. Historically, unpriced menus accompany banquets bankrolled by the
host. They are souveniers, not practical working a la carte documents. "Ladies menus" make perfect sense in late 19th/20th USA context 
when "all things French" were embraced by wealthy folks eager to flash new money in public. 
In the 1970s-1980s "Ladies' menus" were  challenged in court as discriminatory. Restaurants backed down.

"Here's a New Thing--the C'est Si Bon on Brighton Way and Canon Dr. in Beverly Hills, which just opened its new La Potiniere (Conversation) Room, has dreamed up quite an idea. 
In this intimate, beautifully decorated room. patrons can go global, ordering French, Italian, English, Spanish, German and Mexican dishes. But that's not the point. The point 
is that this restaurant has two sets of menus--one for the gentlemen, one for the ladies. One the ladies' menu, no prices are listed. This, of course, is gentility at its utmost. 
But, let's face it, Mr. and Mrs. John Smith go to La Pontiere Room for dinner. Mrs. Smith sees no prices on her menu. She is almost certain to whisper to her 
husband: "Psst, John, how much are the stuffed pork chops and what do they get for a Caesar salad?' Nice try, though." <br>

"The lady pleads for anonymity, but willingly tells her story. One night some time ago she found herself seated with her husband at a Palm Spring restaurant, staring at a menu with 
no prices listed. What she had come up against as an old European custom, that of presenting only the gentleman with a menu bearing prices--a practice still prevalent in 
Paris. But, the lady in Palm Springs reasoned, she was not in Paris and she did not mind being bothered about prices. She was, in fact, offended..."I know it's supposed to be 
high class, but I guess I'm not a elegant lady.' She had reason to be surprised at her menu. Except at a handful of restaurants such s as Chez Cary and Ambrosia in Newport 
Beach, the practice has gradually been dying out in Southern California. That is, it had until Bernard's, the new and much -heralded restaurant at the refurbished Biltmore Hotel in 
downtown Los Angeles, revived the custom upon opening late last year. The purpose, managers at quality restaurant explain, is not to 'inconvenience' the ladies with matters such as 
prices. As it happens, this works out well for the restaurants too. Diners who don't know the price won't hesitate, as they normally might to order the most 
expensive dishes. Because Bernard's is located downtown, a working center for increasing numbers of women executives and professionals, the resurrection by be considered 
either gutsy or foolhardy. It certainly raises all manner of questions. What, for instance, if the lady wants to be inhibited by the prices, so as not to gouge her host for every dollar in 
his pocket? What if the lady is paying for her own meal? What if she simply takes offense and being shielded from such matters as menu prices? What, in other words, of women's 
liberation...Bernard Jacopy, food and beverage director at Bernard's, reacts with mild shock to this last question. 'It's just a matter of haute cuisine and savoir faire, not 
women's lib.'...He acknowledges...that 'some women layers over in the Crocker Bank building' have complained. 'So now whenever they come in, we give them the menus with 
prices. The men who come with them get the menus without prices.' He is careful...to offer the menu with prices when two ladies dine together, or when the reservations 
are in the lady's name, or when it is made clear the lady is the hostess. 'It is not a 'ladies' menu...'Male or female, the host gets the priced menu...This is not very convenient for 
lunch, we have found, but it is nice for dinner.'...At Chez Cary, where only the gentlemen get menus with prices unless a lady hosts the party or other 
arrangements are made...'We do not trouble our ladies with prices. We try to pamper our ladies.'...Geril Muller, owner of Ambrosia, where as a rule only the 
gentlemen get menus with prices, is more adamant. 'It is very rude to be a guest and have prices in front of you. You never show a lady the price of what she orders. 
A lady is a lady and should not be involved in prices...If the lady feels offended or discriminated against, tough luck. She can go somewhere else.'...A survey of a 
cross-section of the better restaurants in Southern California yields none but Bernards, Chez Cary and Ambrosia with 
no-price menus." <br>

"Kathleen Bick took Larry Becker, her partner in a public relations and design business, to a celebration dinner two weeks ago at L'Orangerie, a French restaurant on 
La Ciegna Boulevard. Becker was handed a french menu with prices listed. Because she is a woman, Bick got a pristine, white menu--but no prices, a practice considered 
refined and genteel by many French restaurants. But Bick was 'humiliated and incensed' and she and her partner registered their opinion of L'Orangerie's notion of refinement by walking out 
by walking out without ordering their dinner. On Tuesday, citing California's Unruh Civil Rights Act, they sued the restaurant, charging discrimination, asking for 
statutory damages of at least $250 and seeking a permanent injunction to end L'Orangerie's menu practice. Bick and Becker have also asked the state Alcohol and Beverage Control 
Department to revoke the restaurant's liquor license until its 'discriminatory' practice is changed. Feminist lawyer Gloria Allred, who prepared the Los Angeles Superior Court civil 
suit, denounced the dual menu practice as the 'last bastion of all the rituals having to do with the subordination of women.' Before filing their suit, Bick and Benker said they 
tried in vain to get the restaurant to change its policy...'It's not discrimination. It's not a provocation. It's tradition,' said Ferry [L'Orangerie owner], bewildered at suddenly 
being thrust into the unflattering limelight. 'It's done in the same spirit as lighting a woman's cigarette, or standing up when she enters the room.'...Local French restaurant operators contacted by The Times said the menu 
custom was imported from France, but conceded that even in Europe the custom is bending gradually to women's liberation...Allred said...'It's an assumption that women will always 
be taken care of if they're with a man,...'...Other Los Angeles area French restaurants polled by The Times said they had menus with prices to the host--even if the host 
is a woman--and the menus without prices to guests..." <br>

"Some upper-crust restaurants in France give women diners a menu without prices. Only their male companions are privy to the costs unless
it's specified that the woman is treating. Now, a restauranteur here [London] has gone one step further and elminated prices on all his
menus, but the move has little to do with etiquette. The purpose of this price-less menu is to allow people to pay what they think the
meal is worth. Peter Ilic offers a six-course meal at Just Around the Corner, his cozy French restaurant in northwest London, and lets customers
pay what they like. The wine list is also sans prices. The Yugoslavia-born Ilic said 'This way people pay as much as they like.
 If something is not right, they don't have to pay. I hate an empty restuarant. I would rather pay people to come in and have a meal than have an 
empty restaurant...Ilic said he has wanted to open a restaurant with a no-price menu since he got interested in the business, but
thought such an idea too risky for his first enterprise. Now that the others are healthy, he's putting the unconventional idea to the 
test with Just Around the Corner, a name he chose because it's easy to remember and appropriate for the residential area of the 
restaurant...The amount customers pay varies greatly, Ilic said, but he is not afraid of being misued or cheated. 'I get more
here than from my other restaurants where a meal is about L10-L12 ($14-$17). People are embarassed to leave too little.' The
lowest...was L8 ($11) left by two women after having a three-course meal. The most generous was L80 ($116) for dinner for two on 
New Year's Eve...Ilic admits that one drawback to the no-price menu is that some people are very ill at ease trying to decide on a fair
price. A few insist on being told what to pay. 'I tell them we're searching for a good value. Whatever you ate before, just take 
30% and leave us that much. I would prefer that they leave less and they come back and recommend me to their friends,'...
 The unusual venture has gotten plenty of attention in magazines, newspapers and on the telly. It's been called 'a winner,' 
'good value,' 'lunatic,' 'gimmick,' and 'economically irresponsible.' 'The restaurant will not last long,' predicted Punch
magazine. But, buoyed by the successs of Around the Corner in its first six month, Ilic replied cooly: 'It'll stay forever

<a name="prixfixe">
<b>Prix-fixe</b><p>
Prix fixe dining, charging a set price for an entire meal, is
 not a new concept. Neither is all-you-can-eat. 
Colonial taverns, grand passenger ships, free lunch saloons, college dining halls and Victorian eating clubs were founded on these principles.  
Modern American (upscale) Prix Fixe began in the early 20th century. Prix-Fixe flourished during the
 <a href="restaurants.html#depressionprixfixe">Great Depression</a>, saving many a restaurant from shuttering its doors. The grand
<a href="foodfaq7.html#americanbuffet">American Buffet</a> was a natural iteration on this foodservice theme. 


<p>
"Have you noticed how many restaurants now offer prix-fixe menus? Although prix-fixe is being heralded as a new approach to menu pricing, it is actually not new 
at all. In fact, its origin lies in the hotels of the early 1900s. Prix-fixe is really nothing more than table d'hote, which means "table of the host." Table d'hote, or a 
complete meal at a fixed price, was the only way people could order food in the early inn and tavern dining rooms 90 years ago. The early inns and taverns did not
 give patrons a choice of menu items. The patrons ate whatever the innkeeper prepared that day. The menus in the hotels in the early 1900s were just the opposite.
 Then the typical menu could contain more than 400 different items. Even the smallest hotels offered guests a choice of two to three items over as many as seven 
courses, including appetizers, soups, entrees, vegetables, salads, desserts and nonalcoholic beverages. Back in those days, hoteliers never bothered to track food
 costs because meals were considered a loss leader. Money was not made on rooms, as it is today, but from alcoholic-beverage sales in the saloons. That was the 
origin of the belief that you had to sell liquor to make money in a restaurant. In time, some operators sought to plan and price items separately, or A la carte. Still, 
they continued to offer table d'hote menus because some guests did not see the value in paying more for separate courses. But when Prohibition killed the cash cow
 of alcohol sales, hotels converted their bars to coffee shops and soda fountains. A la carte pricing became the preferred menu format. A la carte portions were 
more substantial than the portions served on the table d'hote courses, which cost more when purchased separately. Bundling the items and selling them for a lower
 price gave customers the incentive to buy a full meal. Although the term table d'hote is not used much today, the bundling of courses at a set price is used in most
 table-service restaurants and even fast-food operations. Fast food purveyors call them "value meals." Perhaps the most enduring example of table d'hote is the club
 breakfast served in every coffee shop. Pancakes, eggs, grits, bacon and toast are included in "hungry farmer breakfasts." Customers probably pay 10 percent to
 20 percent less for prix-fixe breakfasts than they would for each item a la carte. The term prix-fixe is more often associated with white-tablecloth restaurants, 
however. And those restaurants are more readily adopting fixed-price menus. Back in the early 1900s, menu prices were entirely driven by food cost. With the 
pricing restrictions brought about by World War I and the Depression, prices reflected only a slight markup of cost. Food-cost percentages during those times 
averaged about 50 percent. Labor costs were very low, so food costs could be high and still result in a profit. No one thought of adding a premium charge for 
service, amenities or demand. Except for elaborate private functions put on by very wealthy industrialists, prices for food were marked up only two times cost. The 
old table d'hote menus, which required advance preparation, had resulted in food sitting for long periods, resulting in poor food quality and much waste. Cooking to 
order was seen as a way to offer adequate choices to guests during nontraditional meal periods and to keep waste to a minimum. Because sugar, meats, coffee, 
butter and other ingredients were rationed during World War I and World War II, anything that conserved supplies was lauded by operators and the public. The 
elaborate table d'hote offerings were not appropriate during those times, and the media quickly pointed out such extravagances when elaborate parties were thrown.
 A la carte pricing has several advantages over prix-fixe. It allows the customer to spend only what he wants for a meal, and it allows the operator to price each 
course so that it pays its proportion of overhead and returns a profit. Prix-fixe, on the other hand, requires the customer to eat what is listed. Back in the early 
1960s one of the better-known restaurants on Chicago's south side was Club El Bianco. It was an Italian restaurant famous for its signature "fiesta dinners," which 
were really a novel way of presenting a prix-fixe menu...The prix-fixe menu is not universally beneficial. The higher the prices, the smaller the customer base. If your
 target markets are those customers who desire a unique dining experience, then it might work. However, this is a very narrow customer niche that demands the
 very highest level of food, service and ambience. One of the touted benefits of prix-fixe menus is the no-surprises pricing. Both the customer and the operator know 
what the final bill will be. Another advantage of prix-fixe menus is that fewer ingredients are needed, and bulk purchasing can lower costs.Yet prix-fixe may not be 
appropriate for every operator. On most menus the lowest- and highest-priced items in a category are divisible by two and half. For example, if the lowest-priced 
entree is $10.95, the highest priced will be $27.50. If you want an average check of $18 per person, most of your menu items should be priced between $17.50 
and $19.95. In addition, the menu should be designed so that items priced near the desired check average are placed where they are most likely to be selected. 
Servers also should be trained in the suggestive selling of these items. A regular analysis of your menu-sales mix will reveal the items that are helping or hindering 
your cost, sales and profit objectives. While prix-fixe has its place in the high-end markets, the majority of markets are more conservative and price-sensitive. More
 courses mean that customers take longer to eat, reducing table turnover. Only certain markets can support that kind of service during the week. In addition, the
 prix-fixe menu is restrictive, and some customers may be unhappy if they are limited in what they can order when they are asked to pay between $38 and $80 per 
person."<br>

"Is there is a real aristocracy--a food aristocracy--of the dinner table? Would baked beans be esteemed as highly as turkey if both
were the same price? And would caviar always be caviar to the general? As long as the pate de foies gras is ranked on the menu at
70 cents, while pork with 'lovely rice pudding' is 35, never, probably, shall we have a satisfactory answer to questions like these;
we shall not know whether our present food hierarchy is based merely upon rarity or upon true gustatory values. But, so far as the
great middle class of viands is concerned, we are beginning to have an inkling--at least as to what the average American rally 
prefers when price is no object. For a hear now certain restaurants in various cities from New York to California have been making the
patron a quondam king. Up and down a fairly diversified menu he many choose what he wants and all the wants at a fixed, and very 
moderate price. At an entrance fee set customarily between 60 cents and $1 he may roam these particular gastronomic pastures fancy
free. It has been the small boy's dream come true--a kind of glorified and amplified table d'hote, with any unlucky choice 
retrievable by another, and second, third and fourth helpings to the waistband capacity. And, like a small boy's dream fulfillment, it has
been greeted as a kind of horn of plenty in the midst of want. One restaurant chain estimates that it has sold 1,000,000 more meals
in a single month because of it. Another, with fewer shops, has increased its patronage at the rate of 750,000 a month, and is more
than tripling its business on holidays. Thus, for the first time among the rank and file of foods, there has been a large-scale
popularity contest, with no price handicaps. And the early returns are in. During the war the army psychological tests are siad
to have disclosed our national mental age as about 14 years. Our gastronomic age on the new restaurant tests would be similar.
For the result of the wide-open menu has not been vast new inroads on the roast beef and the mutton chops and other stalwar he-man
viands. What we lean, dieting, strenuous go-getters of Yankees really want--according to the past year's comprehsensive
experiment--is more dessert! Our esrtwhile suppressed desires have apparently been for ice cream on our apple pie, more peach
shortcake and another chocolate eclair...Whether the diner is actually tempted to eat more under this system than under that of the
merely printed choices, is a moot point. Possibly, it is believed, he does at first. But after becoming acclimated, so to
speak, to the fragrant wells and mounds of food, he gains a final immunity and eclecticism similar to that induced by the old-fashioned
church supper. Most people do, however--the flat-priced restaurant heads agree--eat, or at least drink, a little more at any rate
than when they have to count the pennies for extra helpings...another cup of coffee, like the free lunch at the old-time
saloon, is coming to be looked upon as an inalienable American right...'Occasionally...a group of three or four persons will come
into one of these restaurants and indulge in an eating race.'...Whether the all-you-want plan is economically sound is also still debated.
...'it would seem that this plan of liberality can scarcely be profitable to a small organization'...Of course the fact is that the
schjeme is essentially a pulmotor devised to keep the restaurant business alive through the present crisis which has hit it 
particularly hard. As such...it has on the whole been successful, enourmously increasing the volume of business..."<br>

Our survey of articles published in the <i>New York Times</i> reveals Tasting Menus (aka Menus Degustation) surfaced in the United States during the
early 1980s. They were a practical byproduct of Nouvelle Cuisine. On some level, the
concept is related to the classic table d'hote and the modern chef's table. 

<p>
"Some fine restaurants may offer a menu degustation ('tasting menu'), consisting of small portions of numerous items to compose
a five- to ten-course meal, sometimes accompanied by paired wines, following the basic classical structure. The menu 
degustation allows chefs to exhibit their skills creating an extensive and varied meal. This elaborate meal is served to 
everyone at the table, thereby eliminating a situation in which some guests have to wait with no food in front of them while
the other guests enjoy the multiple courses. The meal follows classic guidelines, but provides small portions of each of the items
the chef chooses."<br>

"One byproduct of the nouvelle cuisine is the menu de degustation, or tasting menu, that is
offered in many restaurants here--including the Quilted Giraffe, Chanterelle, Claude's and
Lutece--and in France and that is perhaps being overworked. As this new cuisine became
highly publicized, diners were eager to sample all of the dishes they had read about, and so
each person in a group ordered a different appetizer, main course and dessert. Then all would
taste everything. Although that custom existed before the nouvelle cuisine, its practice was
not nearly as widespread; indeed, it was considered declasse in more formal quarters. As the
practice became more frequent, kitchens began to feel the burden of preparing, for example,
12 different dishes correctly timed for one table. Partly for that reason, and also because it
gives diners the opportunity to experience many dishes without the mess of back-and-forth
tasting, the menu de degustation was born. Usually consisting of a set menu with anywhere
from six to eight course determined by the chef, it must be taken by everyone within a party.
Rules prohibit two people ordering that menu while two others choose from the a la carte
selections; that would not making things any easier for the kitchen and probably would
complicate the timing because usually those ordering a la carte would not have more than
three or four courses....But as with so many other good ideas, this one seems to be going bad,
primarily because too many restauranteurs push it for their own convenience but also
because so many diners are insecure. Experienced eaters value suggestions from chefs or
captains...I have never had a menu de degustation when I have not wished a few dishes had
been dropped in favor of others, and, more important, I cannot remember a single knockout
dish eaten from such a menu--so small, it is hard to get a really solid impression of the dish.
The effect is somewhat like eating a variety of canapes at a cocktail party, with much the
same overly complex mixture of seasonings and sauces, and much the same running together
of dishes, resulting in a nagging sense of dissatisfaction and unease...The other negative
effect of the overused menu is that the regular menu falls out of use and one cannot develop
longstanding favorites...In the final analysis, ordering the menu de degustation becomes much
like ordering a complete model room from a department store. You may not go very wrong,
but your own crotchets and preferences will not be there to give it character, and ultimately
the room--or the meal--will not really be yours at all."<br>

This American restaurant option is popularly regarded as the senior citizen's meal of choice. Smaller portions with pro-rated prices
 served in the lull between standard lunch and dinner (4-6PM). In sum: efficient, economical, and intelligent for both diners and
restauranteurs.  
<p>
Our research indicates the "Early Bird Special" dining option was not invented by a particular restaurant, chef or critique.
Like many other tasty phrases, it evolved. While inexpensive dining options served during non-peak
periods have been offered for hundreds of years, the phrase appears to catch on in the early 20th century. Quote books offer
dozens of examples confirming the "early bird" has long been the symbol for wise procurement. 
<p>
The earliest print reference we find using the term "early bird" with regards to commercial sales date to the early 20th 
century. Sometime in the 1950s the term begins to apply to dinners. By the 1960s, the term "early bird special" was ubiquitious
and understood by baby boomers to mean the supper your grandparents ate in Florida. If you were visiting it also meant you 
had to leave the beach way too early to get washed and dressed. And? no matter how 
small the portions, your grandmother always wrapped something up for later. Sometimes she even brought her own baggies or 
re-used foil. What we could not really appreciate then was that Grandmother lived through the Great Depression and WWII. Old habits die hard.
<p>
Today's restauranteurs are re-inventing the Early Bird Special. It is being pitched as both power meal for
busy executives and trendy option for pre-theatre diners. Once again, a Depression-era economy sparks creative 
solutions in the restaurant industry. What goes around, comes around.

<p>
The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> (online edition, accessed 10.29.2009) confirms the term "early bird special," originated in the United States. The first print
 source cited dates to 1917. It refers to a railroad schedule.<blockquote>

<b>The economic model</b><br>
"By offering different prices in different periods, sellers motivate consumers to space their purchases across periods in a profitable manner. Thus, the demand and
 price in each time period is endogenously determined. Consumers and sellers are fully informed and fully rational. This model can explain such phenomena as 
''early-bird specials'' in restaurants and bars, off-season discounts by airlines and hotels, and preseason sales by stores." <br>
---"Peak Load Pricing in Competitive  Markets," Eitan Gerstner,  <i>Economic Inquiry</i>, Apr 1986, Vol. 24, Iss. 2;  (p. 349+)

<b>A survey of early bird (& early dining) articles from historic USA newspapers</b><br> 
Note:we consulted ProQuest Historic Newspapers, Factiva, EBSCO Newspaper Source & NewspaperArchive.com. None of these provide archival deepfile 
coverage of the Miami Herald or other Florida newspapers. This is critical, since Early Bird Special meals are iconically connected with this state.

Early dining the "norm" in our nation's capitol; reflection of civil service work hours. 
<p>
"The New Yorker who settles in Washington is likely to think he is in wonderland until he gets his bearing and accustoms himself to the revolution in his ideas. To
 him everything seems topsy-turvy, and the very hours of the day are all mixed up. It is all because Washington is the seat of the Federal Government. The 
controlling influence in the life of the town is the Government clerk...industries dependent upon them close at 4 o'clock, and the clerks go home in that time...The 
dinner hour in boarding houses is from 4 to 6, instead of beginning at 6, as in New York, so that Mr. and Mrs. Clerk can dine at any time after Mr. Clerk gets
 home. The majority of the boarders may not be clerks, but that makes no difference. A man who wants to visit a restaurant when it is not crowded will find himself
 in no way icommoded if he waits until 6 o'clock. The early dinner hour causes the markets to close early, because almost all the shopping for a four-o'clock dinner 
has to be done before 2...As the department clerk is supposed to finish his dinner at about 5 o'clock, a great many people are in the habit of making evening calls 
earlier than is the fashion in New York."<br>
---"Daily Life in Washington," <i>New York Times</i>, April 28, 1901 (p. 4)  
<p>
<b>[1900-1940s]</b><br>
Several references to "early bird" and "early bird specials;" most posted by department stores promoting product sales. Scattered references to 
Early Bird Dinners held in American Legion Halls seem to refer to incentive events held for people who join/renew memberships early. No information provided 
regarding the actual time of the dinner. "Early Birds" was also an elite organization of pioneer pilots. Amelia Earhart, etc. 
<p>
<b>[1950]</b><br>
Retired folks in Florida demand inexpensive dining options. No time specified.
<p>
"Restaurant patronage. An interesting trend can be observed daily at the restaurants and cafeterias in Miami Beach whose cafeterias rival in splendor the restaurants
 of Hollywood. At the dinner hour long queues from at the doors of the cafeterias and inexpensive restaurants, while in the plushier restaurant guests can find tables
 without waiting. The night clubs report the same situation."<br>
---"Miami Trade Winds," Arthur L. Himbert, <i>New York Times</i>, Jaunary 15, 1950 (p. XX7)
<p>
<b>[1952]</b><br>
First print reference we find to "Early Bird Special" relating to an early dinner.
<p>
"...San Francisco...something new tonight. They call it the Early Bird Special..a dinner...The Early Bird idea means you have to come before..."

<b>[1960s]</b><br>
'Early Bird Special' dining ads begin to proliferate in Los Angeles newspapers.
<p>
"For Sale. Range. Will sacrifice. We won't be needing it since we discovered the Pepper Mill's 'Early Bird' special dinners from 4:30 to 6 PM, Monday through
 Saturday, from just $1.95, complete with soup through dessert, with a choice of entrees."<br>
---display ad, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, March 2, 1961 (p. F9)
<p>
"Early Bird Special: The Lark restaurant at 2624 W 3rd St. serves a lovely dinner from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. for the unbeliveably low price of $1.75."<br>
---"And Did Those Steaks Sing?" Joan Winchell, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, January 26, 1962 (p. A8)
<p>
<b>[1987]</b><br>
Iconic senior dining repackaged as upscale dining option.
<p>
"Benjamin Franklin would be hard-pressed to predict that nowadays the early bird would get not only the worm, but the pasta, the moo shu pork and the salmon 
with dill. Not to mention a sizable discount. Getting a head start on eating out these days can reap some unexpected benefits, including slashed prices at everything 
from homey ethnic storefront restaurants to simple diners, good old-fashioned delis and elegant cafes. With choices like these, few early birds will settle for worms
 anymore.Early evening specials are offered in various forms: prix fixe complete dinners, theater packages, discounts and a la carte items. Some have rigid hours, 
others are more flexible, but almost all are good deals."<br>
---"Flocking to early-Bird Specials," Soon-Har Tan, <i>Chicago Tribune</i>,  Oct 9, 1987 (p. 39)
<p>
<b>[1997]</b><br>
The new power dinner???
<p>
"Forget the power breakfast. Who has time for lunch anymore? For Wall Street the business meal of choice these days is dinner, and the earlier the better. In an 
industry where many arrive at their desks by 7:15 A.M., and a commute home to Westport looms at the end of the evening, 5:30 is just fine for entertaining, making 
the early-bird seating at select Manhattan restaurants -- an hour that elsewhere belongs to children and retirees -- today's real power meal."<br>
---"Power Dinners: The Early Bird Special," Trip Gabriel, <i>New York Times</i>, May 11, 1997, (p.33)
<p>
<b>[2000]</b><br>
This is NOT your grandparent's meal any more. Pre-emptive dining, anyone?
<p>
"THE early-bird special. Is there a more mocked and maligned dining ritual? Who eats before 8 o'clock? It's so Boca Raton, so AARP, so tacky as to be ripe for 
reinvention as New York's next big dining trend -- as long as everyone agrees to call it something else. Pretheater, prix fixe and ''sunset menu'' are the preferred 
euphemisms for cut-rate dinner specials between 5 and 7 p.m. The concept has trickled up from the all-you-can-eat buffets that service Florida's gerontocracy to
 Manhattan's whitest tablecloths.Restaurants that once might have shunned such vulgarity now have early-bird specials. Three courses for $46 at La Caravelle. 
Half-price sushi at March. Pretheater prix fixes extend well beyond the theater district, from Avenue uptown at 85th Street down to Phebe's, on the Bowery, and  sunset menus are promised in establishments where sun seldom shines (like the subterranean Vice Versa in Midtown).Even buzzing places of the moment seem 
eager to make arriving early seem less unfashionable...To see how New York's chronic late birds were reacting to these efforts to get them to migrate to the early 
hours, I tried a week's worth of pre-emptive dining, from 3:30 -- yes, 3:30 -- to 7, but only at places offering the equivalent of early-bird bargains. A few times, I 
was even able to persuade people to go with me.I like to think I was early on the early-bird trend. I was trained that you ate 6:30, and in the company of Walter 
Cronkite. In adulthood, I was ridiculed for espousing the upsides of early dining. Faster service. They're never out of the special entree. Finish at 8 and the whole
 evening stretches before you: see a movie, read a book, shop. Burn calories!...One advantage of the 5 or 6 p.m. dinner preached to me by a couple of 
restaurateurs is better service. The waiters are fresh, not yet beaten down by demanding patrons. Our waiter at Avenue was, for the most part, attentive, though not
 all that attentive considering he had no other customers. I had to wave him down at least once and remind him we had a movie to catch. Getting out in time meant
 either coffee or dessert, but not both. We passed on the banana gateau and, just as we were leaving, another couple arrived...Now, we were getting some of that 
wacky early-bird ambience! Just as we made it out the door at 5:50. Enough time to make the movie, walk out after 20 minutes, go to Cafe Luxembourg for a 
drink, then Coco Opera for another drink. Then go home and read...The economics of the early-bird offering, for a higher-end place, are hard to work out. The 
kitchen is up and running, the waiters standing around rehearsing their lines. As David Cunningham, the chef at the Lenox Room, said of his Monday-to-Saturday, 
5:30 to 6:30, $25 menu: ''We're open. We have the staff there and we have the food there.'' Jimmy Bradley, the chef and a co-owner of Red Cat, in Chelsea, said
 ''There's no way to make money off it.'' His $20 prix fixe, Monday to Friday from 5:30 to 6:30, has drawn in ''dribs and drabs,'' he said, adding, ''Some people are
 like, 'Wow, that's a crazy value' or 'Wow, that's really cheap!'...''The early bird suggests people who might not make it to nightfall,'' Mr. Batterberry said. ''It has
 the aura of the excessively elderly.'' But hip foreign foods like tapas and sushi can get people used to dining after work without feeling like grandparents."<br>
