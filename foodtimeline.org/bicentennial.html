<b>"The Art of Celebration: Ringing In A Joyous Bicentennial," <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>, July 1976</b><br>
"Birthdays, holidays and other rites give life the diamond-shine of legend. They are a time to pause, to mark, to reconsider. And also to celebrate; joy and sentiment are the absolutes! This July fourth, at exactly 2 P.M. EDT, our entire nation will burst into bell-song. In Philadelphia, exactly two centuries to the minute after it pealed its original message of independence, the repaired Liberty Bell with again sound the call. Simultaneously, churches, schools, town halls, fire stations and homes--wherever there is a bell or carillon--will join in the joyful noise for two glorious minutes. Listen to the bells. They are tolling for you, and for the beginning of the third century of our American nation...Happy Bicentennial, America. Your citizens sometimes treat you shabbily, focusing on your faults and failures. Your media dwell too much on the disparities and not enough on the unity. It is time for a Bicentennial celebration, to reach down under the cynical glaze. A familiar flag ripples on its pole, and evokes deep memories. The ringing of the bells reverberates within the chambers of the heart. A child stands, awed and silent, before the Lincoln Memorial, and we are all caught in the web of continuity. Happy Birthday, America. May we all find our own way to celebrate--with joy and with pride.---The Editors"---(p. 67) [NOTE: this issue offers two food features from Sue B.

<b>"Great American Picnics," <i>Redbook</i>, July 1976</b><br>
Whether a simple back-yard party of the lavish 'frolics' often held in the early 19th century, the picnic is an American institution. It is as traditional to the Fourth of July as the 'illuminations,' John Adams specified to be an appropriate observance of the day. The idyllic scene opposite has all the ingredients for a happy outing, whatever century you're in--baskets of good food and wine, children, music and a lovely landscape, a few flowering flirtations and probably some uninvited ants. In the same tradition, Redbook has packed four different kinds of picnics, all in the spirit of 1976...Great American Barbecue Picnic: Mint Juleps, Shandygaffs, Cuba Libres, Grilled Chicken Legs With Lemon Basil Marinade, Steak Sandwiches on Garlic Bread, Flowerpot Salad with Creamy Guacamole, Trash-Can Corn, Banana Split Firecrackers, Cold Beer, Lemonade, Iced Tea...Natural Foods Picnic: Chick-Pea Soup, Pita Bread and Raw Vegetables, Spinach Pies, Supertabouli, Parsley Salad, Fantastic Fruit Thing, Coconut Shortbread Cookies, Cool Herb Tea...Serendipity Picnic: Whether it's Ibsen in the ampitheater, Miss Bette in the band shell or skinny dipping in the swimming hole, this no-recipe picnic can be as ambitious or as fussless as you like. Carry crystal stemware or paper cups; spread out a blue linen cloth or use the gras as a backdrop. Make the menu from the best of what's available in route--from supermarket delicatessen, health-food store or fast-food chain. For example: Southern Fried or Spit-Barbecued Chicken, marinated Artichoke Hearts (speared from the jar), Ripe Plum Tomatoes (take salt and pepper), Fresh Rye Bread, Muenster or Monterey Jack Cheese, Black and Green Grapes (or any summer fruit), Linzer Sandwiches (spread tea cookies with a thin layer o raspberry jam: sandwich then with a thin chocolate bar), Cool White Wine, Coffee Spritzer (Half fill a glass or paper cup with chilled low-calorie coffee soda; top with ice-cold milk)...Elegant Wicker-Basket Picnic: Cream of Water Cress Soup, Country Pate, Tiny Radish and Cucumber Sandwiches, Fresh Cherries and Apricots, Almond Crisps, Chilled White Wine."---(p. 101-118)
