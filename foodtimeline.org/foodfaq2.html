<a name="mozzarella">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Mozzarella cheese</b></font><br>
In America today, mozzarella is the cheese of choice for <a href="foodpies.html#pizza">pizza</a>, <a href="foodfaq2.html#lasagne">
lasagna</a> & other baked Italian-American dishes. It Italy, mozzarella has a long and venerable
tradition. Originally made by monks from buffalo milk, this soft cheese can also be made with cow's milk. 
<a href="foodfaq1.html#friedcheese">Fried cheese</a> is often composed with mozzarella. Fresh mozzarella is sometimes paired
with tomatoes for salads and appetizers. Smoked varieties exist as well.
<p>
<b>Why do we call it "mozzarella?"</b><br>
"Its name in Italion means literally 'little socie'. It is a diminutive form of mozza, 'slice, slice of cheese', a derivative
of the verb mozzare, 'cut off'; which perhaps came ultimately from Latin mutilare."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto[Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 218)
<p>
<b>Product origin & evolution</b><br>
"Mozzarella. As early as the thirteenth century, the monks of San Lorenzo in Capua used to give bread and
mozza to the members of the chapter who took part in their processions but it was not until after
the seventeenth century that buffalo's milk Mozzarella began to be produced on a large scale in
the socalled "bufalare" or "buffalo pastures." Mozzarella di Bufala is a fresh, stretchedcurd
cheese made up of very thin layers."<br>
---<i>Italian Cheese: Two Hundred Types A Guide to Their Discovery and Appreciation</i>, Slow Food Editore [Cuneo:Italy] (p. 84)
[NOTE: this book describes the current process for making mozzarella cheese. If you would like
this information ask your librarian to help you obtain a copy.]

<p>
“Mozzarella, a cheese originally made from buffalo’s milk at Cardito, Aversa, in the Mazzoni of Capua, and in the 
Salernitano, is now made from cow’s milk, and in every part of Italy. It is usually made in fairly small forms, from a 
few ounces up to a pound or more. As well as being eaten raw, Mozzerella is the basis of the Pizza Napoletana, and is used
 in the famous Bolognese Petto di Tacchino alla Cardinale, as well as the more humbil Suppli al Telefono.”<br>
---<i>Cheeses of the World</i>, Andre Simon [Faber & Faber:London] 1960 (p. 91)
<p>
"Mozzarella.
A soft fresh cheese made from cow's or buffalo's milk. One of the most important and ubiquitous
cheeses in Italy, though southern ones are the best...Mozzarella was once made mostly from buffalo's milk...but when the Nazis retreated from Italy
in World War II, they killed off most of the herds. The cheese was then made with cow's
milk...although the buffalo herds have been restocked with animals from India. Today "mozzarella
di bufala" is again common, though it often contains only a small percentage of buffalo milk."<br>
---<i>Dictionary Of Italian Food and Drink</i>, John Mariani [Broadway Books:New York] 1998  (p. 159) 
<p>
"In Italian neighbourhoods in the United States, the Italian grocer will have received his daily shipment of mozzarella 
curd from a local distributor and will himself have completed the final steps of manufacture, heating the white, pliant 
curd, kneading it until it is soft, and moulding it into irregular spherical shapes...The facotry -made mozzarella that 
is sold largely in supermarkets is another--and a most uninteresting--cheese. It is older, firmer, and without juice, 
because unlike the mozzarellas you find in Italy or in Italian-American neighborhoods, these are manufactured and packaged
 for a longer shelf life, and toward that end its juices--one of its most beguiling characteristics--have been wrung from
 it...The recently developed 'pizza cheese' made in the Middle West and shipped to the Eastern states of America is even 
drier than the factory-made mozzarella. And so it must be, we are told; otherwise it would never reach the customer's pie
 in good condition."<br> 
---<i>The Cheese Book</i>, Vivienne Marquis and Patricia Haskell [Leslie Frewin:London] 1966 (p. 34-5)
<p>
“In the early twenty-first century, processed cheese competes with mozzarella for the largest annual sales numbers. 
Distinct from the classic cooked and stretched pasta filata Italian mozzarella, the cheese produced in the United States 
is mostly a brined product used to make ever-increasing quantities of fresh and frozen pizza.”<br>

Researching the history of bread-related products is difficult because bread is THE universal food.
Ancient peoples of all places discovered the combination of *cooked* (baked, fried, steamed,
boiled, sun-dried) ground grain and water created simple, inexpensive, nourishing food. Muffins,
cakes, crackers, biscuits, cookies, sticky buns & Twinkies are not inventions. They are evolutions.
All of these are variations on the theme of what happens when flour & water mix with human
ingenuity, technological advancement, local ingredients, immediate need and cultural
expectations.
<p>
What the food historians have to say about the origin of muffins...
<p>
"Muffin...a term connected with  moufflet, an old French word applied to bread, meaning
 soft....The word  muffin first appeared in print in the early 18th century, and recipes began to
be published in the middle of the 18th century. There has always been some confusion between
muffins, crumpets, and pikelets, both in recipes and in name.  Muffin' usually meant a breadlike
product (sometimes simply made from whatever bread dough was available), as opposed to the
more pancake-like crumpets...Muffins were most popular during the 19th century, when muffin
men traversed the town streets at teatime, ringing their bells. In the 1840s the muffin-man's bell
was prohibited by Act of Parliament because many people objected to it, but the prohibition was
ineffective..."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999(p.
517)
<p>
"Muffin...In Great Britain, a muffin is a traditional light-textured roll, round and flat, which is
made with yeast dough. Muffins are usually enjoyed in the winter - split, toasted, buttered, and
served hot for tea, and sometimes with jam. In the Victorian era muffins were bought in the street
from sellers who carried trays of them on their heads, ringing a handbell to call their wares. In
North America muffins are entirely different. The raising (leavening) agent is baking powder and
the muffins are cooked in deep patty (muffin) tins. Cornmeal and bran are sometimes substituted
for some of the flour."<br>
---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, Jenifer Harvey Lang editor [Crown:New York] 1988 (p.
703)
<p>
"Muffin...a small yeast cake usually sweetened with a bit of sugar. In England muffins were once
called "tea cakes," while in America muffins are served primarily for breakfast or as an
accompaniment to dinner...The origins of the word are obscure, but possible it is from Low
German  muffe [meaning] cake. The term was first printed in English in 1703, and Hannah
Glasse in her 1747 cookbook fives a recipe for making muffins.  Mush muffins (called
 slipperdowns in New England) were a Colonial muffin made with hominy on a hanging
griddle."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Freidman
Books:New York] 1999 (p. 211)
<p>
"Sometimes misnamed gems, muffins were baked in deeper pans and were not quite as breadlike
as gems. Muffins graduated from being cooked in a utensil called muffin rings to a special baking
pans. Muffin rings were hooplike accessories placed directly on a hot stove or the bottom of a
skillet. Batter was then poured into them. The rings did not prove to be as popular with muffin
consumers as molds of the same period. However, their demise as holders of raw muffin batter
was not in vain, for they remain a valuable kitchen accessory to make popular English muffins or
fried eggs. The muffin molds of the nineteenth century turned out to be an extremely deficient
product. The baked their contents thoroughly and very evenly..."<br>

<b>About English muffins</b><br>
"English muffins" as American know them today are most closely connected with the ancient
Welsh tradition of cooking small round yeast cakes known as "bara" [bread] "maen" [stone] on
bakestones. "English muffins" were later cooked on griddles, as opposed to muffin tins. Related

"The English muffin is round and made from a soft yeast-leavened dough enriched with milk and
butter. It is usually cooked on a griddle, which gives it a flat, golden-brown top and bottom, and a
white band around the waste and a light, spongy interior...This method appears as early as 1747
and was recommended by Hannah Glasse."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999
<p>
Mrs. Glasse's original recipe was not titled English muffins.  She also includes instructions for proper
opening (warning NOT! to use a knife).<br>
<blockquote>
"<b>To make Muffings and Oat-Cakes</b><br>
To a Buschel of Hertfordshire white Flour, take a Pint and a half of good Ale-yeast, from pale
Malt if you can get it, becuase it is whitest; let the Yeast lie in Water all night, the next Day pour
off the Water clear, make two Gallons of Water just Milk warm, not to scald your Yeast, and two
Ounces of Salt, mix your Water, Yeast and Salt well toghether for about a quarter of an Hour,
then strain it, and mix up your Dough as light as possible, and let it lie in your Trough an Hour to
rise, then with your Hand roll it, and pull it into little Pieces about as big as a large Walnut, roll
them with your Hand like a Ball, lay them on your Table, and as fast as you do them lay a Piece of
Flannel over them, and be sure to keep your Dough cover'd with Flannel; when you have rolled
out all your Dough, begin to bake the first, and by that Time they will be spread out in the right
Form; lay them on your Iron, as one Side begins to change Colour turn the other, and take great
Care they don't burn, or be too much discolour'd; but that you will be a Judge off in two or three
Makings. Take care the middle of the Iron is not too hot, as it will be, but then you may put a
Brick-bat or two in the middle of the Fire to slacken the heat. The Thing you bake on must be
made thus. Build a Place just as if you was going to set a Copper, and in the Stead of a Copper a
Piece of Iron all over the Top fix'd in Form, just the frame as the Bottom of the Iron Pot, and
make your Fire underneath with Coal as in a Copper; observe, Muffings are made in the same
Way, only this, when you pull them to Pieces roll them in a good deal of Flour, and with a
Rolling-pin roll them thin, cover them with a Piece of Flannel, and they will rise to a proper
Thickness; and if you find them too big or too little, you must roll Dough accordingly, these must
not be the least discoloured. <p>
And when you eat them, toast them with a Fork crisp on both Sides, then with your Hand pull
them open, and they will be like a Honey-Comb; lay in as much Butter as you intend to use, then
clap them together again, and set it by the Fire, when you think the Butter is melted turn them,
that both Sides may be butter'd alike, but ton't touch them with a Knife, either to spread or cut
them open, if you do they will be as heavy as Lead, only when they are quite butter'd and done,
you may cut them across with a Knife."<br>

Did you know? Thomas Jefferson's <a
href="http://www.monticello.org/jefferson/dayinlife/breakfast/at.html">muffin recipe</a> would
have produced "English muffins."
<p>
Thomas' brand English muffins were introduced to New York City in the late 19th century:<br>
"Although tea muffins that were once popular in England resembled the American "English
muffin," there is no single muffin in Britain by this specific name...Most of the store-bought
varieties [of English muffin] derive from those made by the S. B. Thomas Company of New York,
whose founder, Samuel Bath Thomas, emigrated from England in 1875 with his mother's recipe
and began making muffins at his Ninth Avenue bakery in 1880. The name was first printed in
1925."<br>

<b>Crumpets & <a href="foodfaq2.html#scones">scones</a></b><br>
The first use of any food often predates the first occurance of printed evidence by many years. To
further complicate matters, variant spellings often appear in older texts. An inspection of recipes
confirms or refutes culinary linkage. The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> traces the history of
the
word and recipe for crumpets back to 1382:
<p>
"Crumpet...[Not known till late in 17th century], Wyclif has however 'crompid cake' as a
rendering in laganum, which may be the antecedent of the name. [1382:Wyclif] A cake of a loaf, a
crusted cake spreynde with oyle, a crompid cake...[1694:Westmacott] The make Cakes of it
(Buck Wheat)...as they do oat-cakes, and call it Crumpit. Crumpet...A soft cake made of flour,
beaten egg, milk, and barm or baking powder, mixed into batter, and baked on an iron
plate...Now usually a soft, round, doughy cake made with flour and yeast, cooked on a griddle or
the like and usually eaten toasted with butter. [1769:Raffald] To make tea crumpets..."
---<i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, 2nd edition, volume IV (p. 83)
<p>
"The origins of the crumpet are mysterious. As early as 1382, Johy Wycliffe, in his translation of the Bible, mentioned
crompid cake, whose name may be the precursor of the modern term, but the actual 'cake' itself does not bear much resemblance to the present-day
crumpet. It seems to have been a thin cake cooked on a hot griddle, so that the edges curled up (crompid goes back to Old
English crump, crumb, 'crooked', and is related to the modern English crumple). The inspiration behind its naming thus seems to be 
very familiar to that of crepe, which literally means 'curled'. Earliest recipes for crumpets, from the late seventeenth century,
continue this theme, standardly using buckwheat flour, and it is not until nearly a hundred years later that crumpets as we know
then today beging to emerge...During the 19th century the crumpet--toasted before the fire, its honeycomb of cavities filled
with melting butter--established itself as an indispensible part of the English teatime scene."<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 100)
<p>
"The earliest published recipe for crumpets of the kind known now is from Elizabeth Raffald
(1769)." <br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
230)
<p>
<b>[1769] Elizabeth Raffald's recipe:</b><blockquote><br>
"To make tea crumpets Beat two eggs very well, put them to a quart of warm milk and water, and
a large spoonful of barm: beat in as much fine flour as will make them rather thicker than a
common batter pudding, then make your bakestone very hot, and rub it with a little butter
wrapped in a clean linen cloth, then pour a large spoonful of batter upon your stone, and let it run
to the size of a tea-saucer; turn it, and when you want to use them roast them very crisp, and
butter them."<br>
---<i>The Experienced English Housekeeper</i>, Elizabeth Raffald, [unabridged facsimile 1769
print with an introduction by Roy Shipperbottom [Southover Press:East Sussex] 1997
</blockquote>
<p>

"The probable origin of the word crumpit is the Welsh "cremog," a pancake or fritter. For some
reason or other, probably because they are in some degree similar, and yet differing greatly, it is
customary to associate muffins wtih crumpets, it being a rare occurance for either to appear at the
table separately. Both are made of batter, both require re-cooking, and both are served hot and
well buttered; yet there is so marked a difference between the two in flavour and constitution that
most persons have a decided preference for one or the other.'"<br>

<b>Scones</b><br>
The origin of scones is closely connected with the ancient Welsh tradition of cooking small round
yeast cakes known as "bara" [bread] "maen" [stone] on bakestones. These early leavened bread
products were later cooked on griddles. The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> traces the word
"scone" in print to 1513. This book suggests the history of the word is derived from Middle
Dutch (schoonbrot) or Middle German (schonbrot), meaning "fine bread." Scones that we know
today are leavened with modern baking powder/soda, both mid-19th century inventions. About <a
href="foodfaq.html#bakingpowder">baking powder</a>. Scones are traditionally connected with
Scotland, Ireland and England.
<p>
"Scone. A large found cake made of wheat or barleymeal baked on a griddle; one of the four
quadrant-shaped pieces into which which a cake is often cut;  more generally, a soft cake of barley
or oatmeal, or
wheat-flour, baked in single portions on a griddle or in an oven."<br>
---<i>The Oxford English Dictionary</i>, 2nd edition
<p>
"The scone comes from Scotland--the first known reference to it comes in a translation of the
<i>Aeneid</i> (1513) by the Scots poet Gavin Douglas:  The flour sconnis war sett in, by and by,
wyth other mesis.' Made from fine white fout (echoing the possible source of their name, Dutch
schoonbroot,  fine white bread'), sour milk or buttermilk, and a raising agent (since the
mid-nineteenth century, bicarbonate of soda), and baked on a griddle or in the oven, scones
originally
came in the form of flat cakes cut into four, producing portions that were either square or, if the
original cake were round, roughly triangular. Individually baked round scones are a later
development. The pronunciation of the word <i>scone</i> has never really settled down. Early
spellings suggest a short vowel, rhyming with swan, but the version with the diphthong, rhyming
with <i>stone</i>, is if anything commoner today."<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p.
304)
<p>
"Scone...What is certain is that the term is mainly a British one, and covers a wide range of small,
fairly plain
cakes. Leavened with baking powder, or bicarbonate of soda, and an acid ingredient such a sour
milk, they
are quickly made and best eaten hot with butter. Scone recipes are found in great variety up and
down the
British Isles but, together with the closely related bannock, are particularly a Scottish
specialty."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
704)
<p>
"The Scots are famous for the variety of scones (from the Gaelic, sgoon, and it should rhyme with
 gone'): some of the most popular ones are [soda scones, wholemeal scones, rich white scones,
treacle scones, potato scones, ballater scones and drop scones.]"<br>
---<i>Traditional Scottish Cookery</i>, Theodora Fitzgibbon [Fontana:Suffolk] 1980 (p.
231-5)<br>
[NOTE: This book contains recipes for each of the scones listed above.]
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>[1874]<br>
"Scones.</b><br>
Put as much barley-meal as will be required into a bowl, add a pinch of salt, and stir in cold water
to make a stiff paste. Roll this out into round cakes a quarter of an inch thick, and bake on a
girdle. Split the cakes open, butter them well, and serve hot. A little butter may be rubbed into the
meal if liked. Richer scones may be made by dissolving an ounce of fresh butter in a pint of hot
milk, and stirring this into as much flour as will make a stiff dough. When it is not convenient to
bake the scones on a girdle, a thick frying-pan may be used instead. Time to bake the scones,
about four minutes."

"Scones</b><br>

handled quickly, balked on a hot girdle, and served at once. Flour, butter, salt, and cream are the ingredients for one recipe
for another sago boiled im milk, salt, and flour. Others were made with barm or yeast. The lightest scones are those made with
sour cream, sour milk, or buttermilk. Four 1 lb. flour and 1 teaspoon use: 3/4 teaspoon bicarbonate of soad and the same quantity
of cream or tartar, with enough buttermilk to mix to a soft dough--or--Other additions to each pound of flour may be 1-2 oz.
sugar, 2 oz. fat, 2 oz. fruit, 1-2 eggs may replace part of the liquid. The soda and cream of tartar should be free of lumps, 
and these and the flour should be sieved before mixing. Fat is rubbed in with the fingers. The dough should be soft and moist
and must be mixed in a bowl, turned on to a floured board, kneaded very lightly, pressed out to the required thickness
(generally about 3/4 inch), and then cut in triangles or circles. The scones should be cooked on a girdle or in the oven. Time
7-15 minutes."<br>

<b>Bannock</b><br>
This simple bread stuff is interesting because it embraces not one, but several recipes and cooking methods. The genesis belongs to
the British Isles, circa 1000AD. The connecting culinary thread is this food was composed of cheap 
grains consumed by the common people with rudimentary cooking facilties. Old World recipes purposed oats and barley. New World versions introduced maize/corn to the
mix. While some Native American peoples ate bannock-type foods, the recipes below confirm British origination. New World bannocks
are found in places where Scottish peoples settled in high concentrations.  
<p>
The earliest recipes we found titled "Bannock"
were published in the 19th century. They do not show up in early Scottish cook books (
<i>Lady Castlehill's Receipt Book</i> [1712] <i>Mrs. McLintock's Receipts for Cookery
and Pastry-Work</i> [1736], Meg Dod's <i>Cook and Housewife's Manual</i> [1829]). This is not surprising since these books,
like their contemporary London counterparts, were published for the upper classes.
<p>
<b>What is bannock?</b><br>
According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>
" The name, in Scotland and north of England, of a form in which home-made bread is made; usually unleavened, of large 
size, round or oval form, and flattish, without being as thin as ‘scon’ or oat-cake. In Scotland, bannocks are usually of 
barley- or pease-meal, but may be of wheaten flour; in some parts a large fruit cake or bun of the same shape is called a 
currant-bannock. In north of England the name is sometimes given to oat- or haver-bread, when made thicker and softer
 than an oat-cake; but local usage varies. (Cf. the dialect glossaries)." The earliest print evidence is this:
"a1000 Gloss in Haupt's Zeitschr. IX. 463 Bucellam semiplenam, healfne bannuc." (accessed online September 7, 2013)
<p>
<b>Why call it "bannock?"</b><br>
"The word bannock is probably of Celtic origin; it may be related to Breton bannach, 'drop, bit' and Cornish banna, 
'drop'." <br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 18)
<p>
<b>Who ate bannocks?</b><br>
"Bannocks are the bread of the less priviledged fringes of Britain. While southern England luxuriated in soft leavened wheat bread, 
areas like Scotland, Wales, and northern England had largely to make do in former times with round fairly flat loaves made
from oatmeal or barley flour and bkaed on griddles and bakestones. Bannock was the name given to such loaves made from barley in Scotland, and 
in northern England it was used for a thick verson of the oatcake."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 18)
<p>
<b>Scotland's bannock:</b><br>
"The word 'bannock' covers several different kinds of foods: generally it refers to griddle or girdle cakes made with oatmeal, barley meal, pease-meal or with flour, 
but there is the Selkirk Bannock...and the Pithcaithly Bannock...which are sweetened tea-breads or cakes. From the earliest years special kinds of bannocks were 
made for every Highland quarter day: on 1 February, the Bonnack Bride (St. Bride's bannock) was cooked to celebrate the first day of Spring; the Bonnach 
Bealtain (Beltane bannock) for the first day of summer, Bonnach Lunastain (Lammas bannock) for the first day of autumn and the Bonnach Samhtain (Hallomas 
bannock) for the first day of winter. Bannocks were baked for a child's birth (Cryin' Bannock), and there was a Teethin' Bannock baked with a ring in it which was 
later used as a teething ring, and when the bannock broke each person present got a small piece of it. There were special bannocks fired for St. Columba's Eve, for 
marriage and for Christmas. Each one was a variety of oatcake...some made with eggs, butter, cream and sugar. Today many of these customs have died out but 
the bannock remains in several forms. If using a griddle then it must be warmed up before starting to cook."<br>

<b>Canadian pioneer experience:</b><br>
"Flour was a luxury item in the early days of the fur trade. Only a small ration was carried in the crowded canoes. It was used to thicken
the pemmican style soup, rubbaboo, or occasionally to make galettes...By the mid 1800's grain was raised at Red River and a few ot he
major fur trading posts. After that time, bannock became a staple food used by both fur traders and settlers. The original 
flour water mixture became more elaborate by adding salt, suet, lard, butter, buttermilk, baking soda, or baking powder. Other names for the
product were grease bannock, baking powder bannock, grease bread, bush bread, and trail bread. The fur traders introduced bannock
to the Indians. It wasn't used much due to the absence of flour until the buffalo herds disappeared and the Indians were located
on reserves. Out of necessity it became a staple food for them using flour provided by government agencies. Bannock continued to be the bread product used
by settlers almost exclusively until 1880 and for years after that in some localities...Bannock was made into a large round
biscuit and baked in a frying pan or in the ashes of the campfire. Usually the frying pan was tilted against a rock so that it
slanted towards the fire for part of the baking. Jock Carpenter described a typical method of preparing bannock in the 
1870's. 'Flour was not plentiful with us, so even a small bannock was a real treat to us children. Mother mixed flour, salt and water 
together, kneading the dough quite firm and shaping it into round cakes. As we carried but one frying pan the cakes of bannock were first crusted on it,
then stood up abainst sticks in a large circle around a brighly lit fire, with mother keeping guard to turn them often so both
sides might be browned evenly.' Early pioneers baked large or small bannocks in outdoor bake ovens, on the stove lids, if they had
a stove. During the later years they were baked in a frypan on top of the stove or in the oven. Another adaptation used by fur traders, and
by Indian living on reservations, was to fry the bannock in grease, hense the name 'grease bread.'"<br>

4 oz. (125 g.) candied orange peel, chopped, optional<br>
a little milk mixed with sugar for glazing<br>
Heat the butter and lard until soft, but do not let it oil. Add the milk, warmed to blood heat and reserve. Cream the yeast with the 
1/2 teaspoon sugar, add the milk and butter mixture and let the yeast work. Meanwhile sift the flour, make a well in the middle and pour in the
liquid, then sprinke the flour from the sides lighlty over thetop, so that it bubbles through and makes a batter. Cover with a cloth
and leave in a warm place for about 1 hour or until it has almost doubled in size. Knead well by punching it down, add the fruit with the 
remaining sugar and the peel. Knead again for about 5 minutes, then shape into a round flattish shape (or put into a loaf tin if preferred,

<b>About American muffins</b><br>
American muffins today are quite distinguishable from their English counterparts. This was not
always so. An examination of American muffin recipes printed in 19th and 20th century
cookbooks reveals some interesting culinary history. Early American muffin recipes were quite
similar (if not exact copies) of English muffins. Given the history of our country this is not
surprising. These same cookbooks also contain recipes for  tea cakes' and other cakes to be
baked in small pans which read more like the  cakey muffins we know today in America. Tea
cakes often called for spices, nuts and dried fruits (currants, dates, etc.). They were sweeter and
were more likely to be baked than griddled. 
<p>
According to the <i>Dictionary of American Regional English</i>, Frederick G. Cassidy and Joan
Houston Hall, editors, muffins are defined thusly "A small cake; a cupcake." The first print
reference cited is "1879: Tyree, <i>Housekeeping in Olde Virginia</i>, 38, "Another recipe for
muffins...make the batter the consistency of pound cake, and bake in snow-ball cups as soon as
made." The <o>Oxford English Dictionary</i> does not describe American-type muffins.
<p>
"Muffins...Women were making muffins well before the twentieth century...these varied mainly
according to the type of flour used-white, graham, rye, corn. Sometimes a handful of chopped
dates and/or raisins would be added, inch which case muffins became "Fruit Gems."...For the
most part, however, muffins remained basic-plain-until well into the twentieth Century. For years
we had a fairly set repertoire of muffins: bran, blueberry, corn, date, apple, oatmeal, and such.
Then in the  70s and  80s, muffin madness set in. Muffins exploded to three or four times their
normal size...."<br>
---<i>American Century Cookbook: The Most Popular Recipes of the 20th Century</i>, Jean
Anderson  [Clarkson Potter:New York] 1997 (p. 332)
<p>
American cookbooks confirm Mrs. Anderson's statement. Even into the early part of the 20th
century, muffin recipes are few and basic. In 1920s recipes for muffins became more prolific, but
were variations on the same basic theme of nuts, dried fruits and different flours (Graham, corn,
rice,  potato, etc.). Muffins with meat (Ham-and-Bacon Muffins) and vegetables (Squash,

<b>About blueberry muffins</b><br>
It is doubtful that you will be able to trace the exact place where blueberry muffins were invented,
but we can make some assumptions. First, true blueberries are native to North America, bilberries
(a similar type of berry) are native to Central and Northern Europe. European settlers adapted
their recipes (muffins, cakes, breads & use of fresh/dried fruits) to New World foodstuffs out of
necessity. Therefore, anyplace where <a href="fruit.html#blueberries">blueberries</a> (they would have been the wild variety, not the
plump, juicy berries we are used to seeing in the stores) grew, blueberry muffins might have been
made. In the New World blueberries grew from North Carolina to Nova Scotia. Native Americans
also used blueberries in their foods:
<p>
"A favorite dish of the Native Americans during colonial times was Sautauthig (pronounced
saw¡-taw-teeg), a simple pudding made with dried, crushed blueberries, dried, cracked corn(or
samp), and water. Later, the settlers added milk, butter and sugar when they were available. The
Pilgrims loved Sautauthig and many historians believe that it was part of the first Thanksgiving
feast. In a letter to friends back in England, one colonist describes how Sauthauthig was prepared: 
<br>
     "...this is to be boyled or stued with a gentle fire, till it be tender, of a fitt consistence, as of
Rice so boyled, into which Milke, or butter be put either with sugar or without it, it is a food very
pleasant...but it must be observed that it be very well boyled, the longer the better, some will let it
be stuing the whole day: after it is Cold it groweth thicker, and is commonly Eaten by mixing a
good Quantity of Milke amongst it."<br>

Food historians tell us prehistoric peoples most likely consumed fungi and mushrooms. These foods  were
easy to forage and incorporate into meals. The Ancient Romans appreciated the taste and grew mushrooms.
Modern cultivation commenced around the 16th century. <a href="foodfaq2.html#truffles">Truffles</a>, from the Perigord region in France are
considered some of the most delicate and expensive specimens of this particular type of food. <a href="foodfaq2.html#portobello">

<p>
 Mushrooms are a subset of the larger plant world of fungus:
<p>
"Fungus in the scientific sense, means any group of simple plants which include mushrooms and similar
plants, yeasts, moulds, and the rusts which grow as parasites on crops. Unlike more advanced plants, fungi
lack chlorophyll and so can only grown as sprophytes (from dead plants or animals); or as parasites (on living
plants); or in a mycorrhizal relationship (symbiosis between fungi and the roots of trees)...The importance of
fungi for human food is not limited to those which are eaten as such, or are visible. Many which are
microorganisms play an important part in making or processing human food. Yeasts are an obvious example,
and are regarded as beneficent because of their role in, for example, the making of bread
dough...'Musrhooms', to use the term loosely as applying to edible fungi in general, are far better known as
food in the northern than in the southern hemisphere."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 326)
<p>
"Mushrooms and other large varieties of fungus have geen eaten since earliest times, as traces of puffballs
in the prehistoric lake dwellings of Switzerland, Germany, and Austria show; but not by everyone and not
everywhere. The rarest and finest mushrooms, such as the truffle and the oronge, were highly esteemed in
classical Greece and Rome, and have always been expensive...some mushrooms have been successfully
cultivated for a long time. In classical times both Greeks and Romans grew the small Agrocybe aegerita...on
slices of a poplar trunk. The Chinese and Japanese may have been growing chitake on rotting logs for even
longer. Modern European cultivation goes back to 1600, when the French agriculturist Olivier de Serres
suggested a method in his work Le Theatre d'agriculture des champs. In 1678 another Frenchman, the
botanist Marchant, demonstrated to the Academie des Sciences how mushrooms could be  sown in a
controlled way by transplanting their mycelia (filaments whcih spread through the soil underneath them like
fine roots)."<br>

"Fungi have been associated with humans since prehistoric times and must have been collected and eaten
along with other plants by hunter-gatherers prior to the deveolpment of agriculture...Although their prehistoric
use remains uncertain, they may have been employed as food, in the preparation of beverages, and as
medicine. There is, however, no specific evidence for the use of fungi prior to the Neolithic period, when fungi
consumption would have been associated with the drinking of mead (yeast-fermented diluted honey) and
yeast-fermented beer or wine, and, somewhat later, the eating of yeast-fermented (leavened) bread."<br>

"Cave drawings and paintings tell us hardly anything about the plants the cavedwellers ate, and it is even rarer
to find them showing mushrooms, which does not mean that the latter never featured on prehistoric menus.
Residues identified prove that other vegetables were in fact eaten, even if few felt any urge to depict them on
cabe walls. Morever, if we look at the dietary customs of contemporary peoples who are still at the Paleolithic
or Neolithic stage of development, there is plenty of evidence of an interest in mushrooms both edible and
poisonous. The latter can be used for hunting, fishing, or indeed for homicial purposes...The ancient Egyptians
and Romans greatly enjoyed mushrooms...The Bible, although full of references to food of many kinds, never
mentions mushrooms, either in praise or otherwise..."<br>

"The first evidence that mushrooms were used as human food in prehistoric Europe is the recent find of a
bowl of field mushrooms in a Bronze Age house near Nola in Italy. Mushrooms were gathered from the wild.
Classical Greek authors tend to treat them as famine food, on the level with acorns. By Romans, however,
they were so highly regarded that the Stoic writer Seneca gave up mushrooms (boleti) as unnecessary
luxuries---an approach to the vegetarianism and asceticism that he toyed with. Recipes are suggested by

<b>About mushrooms in America</b><p>
"...it may seem surprosing that mushrooms entered the American culinary limelight only in the late nineteenth century. Until the 
1890s, most mushroom recipes were for ketchups, sauces, and pickles, with occasional stewed mushooms or French-influenced dishes
named "champignons." Few Americans included mushrooms in kitchen gardens, which was undertandable given Hannah Glasse's rare and 
unappetizing instructions for mushroom cultivation...mushroom gathering was fraught with danger, for no reliable American
guides distinguished between gustatory pleasure and peril. Typical is <i>The Kentucky Housewife</i> (1839) by Lettice Bryan, which
simply warns the cook to "be careful to select the esculent mushrooms, as some of them are very poisonous." Mushroom cultivation
began in seventeeth-century France...The techniques were perfected in the 1870s and spread abroad, just as French cookery became
fashionable in America. By the 1890s, a veritable fungus frenzy was sweeping America, bot as a fad food and as a scientific
curiousity. Mushrooming clubs, were forager swapped tips, spring up quickly. Meticulously illustrated literature educated
amateurs and professionals in identifying and cooking mushrooms...The first professional information on mushroom cultivation in 
America was disseminated on a large scale in the 1890s, mainly through the efforts of William Falconer."<br>

truffles...Truffles are also among the oldest vegetables in the historical record."<br> 
---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kenneth F. Kiple & Kriemhild Conee Orneals
[Cambridge University Press:Cambridge] 2001, Volume Two (p. 1872) 

<p>
"The original truffle is the underground fungus of the genus Tuber, prized by gastronomes of
several millennia for its ineffable perfume and its supposed aphrodesiac qualities. The Roman
gourmet Apicius gave seven recipes for preparing it, and Brillat-Savarin apostophised it as 'the
diamond in the art of cookery'. Until the nineteenth century truffles seem to have been
relatively abundant...but these days demand so far outstrips the supply that (like oysters) they
have passed beyond the reach of all but the very well-heeled." <br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2993 (p. 351) 
<p>
"Truffles, althoug treated as a delicacy by both Greeks and Romans, were also somewhat of a
puzzle to them. Mushrooms they could in their own way understand as they had both stalks
and 'roots'. but truffles just appeared buried in the earth with no clue as to their origin.
According to Pliny the most prized truffles came from Africa; Juevenal, more precisely,
mentions Libya as the source of the best truffles, though Marital considered them to be still
second to boleti. It us to Apicius again that we must turn to see how truffles were eaten in
Ancient Rome. He recommends first scraping, then boiling, and afterards grilling them lightly
on skewers; after this they are to be returned to a pan for boiling, this time with liquamen,
carenum, pepper, wine and honey. When this sauce has thickened, he says, they can again be
grilled wrapped in a sausage skin, and then served as they are. In addition, Apicius gives three
sauces for serving with them and another recipe for cooking them. The Romans may not have
known much about the origins of truffles but they certainly had ideas about preparing them for
the table." <br>

"Truffles had been known in Babylon as well as Rome...Although the people of medieval Baghdad feasted on truffles from the Arabian desert, in France Truffles 
remained sunk in obscurity until the fourteenth century, when they were pickled in vinegar, soaked in hot water and served with butter. That they were eaten at all 
was probably due to their reputation as an aphrodesiac (a label that was attached to most new or rare foods until the modern period.)...La Varenne suggested 
cooking truffles like mushrooms, but although Louis XIV was one famous enthusiast and Napoleon another, it was not well into the nineteenth century that the 
French really became converts. The truffles became so fashionable that the demand trebled, and so did the price."<br>

<a name="portobello">
<B>Portobello</b><br>
The food experts generally agree on three points when it comes to the history of portabellas:<br><ol>
<li>This meaty mushroom is an American invention with Italian roots (spores, actually) made popular  by
clever marketing in the late 1980s/early 1990s.  Both <a href="foodfaq2.html#cremini">cremini</a> and portobello mushrooms are first
mentioned in the New York Times during the mid 1980s.
<li>There are several theories regarding the name. Although these mushrooms are also currenty enjoyed in
fine dining establishments of Central/South America, there  is no apparent connection between the town of
Portobelo (Panama) the origination of the name or item. 
<li>There is no definative spelling of this fungus. According to Google (not a scientific, but a popular
survey), Portobello is preferred (169,000), followed by portabella (33,100) and portobella (3, 510).
</ol>
<p>
"By the late 1800s...Italian growers also cultivated the common mushroom but prefering the brown-capped
variety, which are often called cremini mushrooms (or Italian brown) and have an earthy flavor that is fine
for soups and stews and for stuffing. The large and beefy Portabello (also Roma) is acutally a fully grown
cremini, with dense and meaty flesh that lends itself nicely to grilling or roasting. Originally, cremini
mushrooms were imported from Italy, but now they are cultivated in the United States."<br>

Press:Cambridge] 2000, Volume Two (p. 1818)
<p>
"The name "portobello" began to be used in the 1980s as a brilliant marketing ploy to popularize an
unglamorous mushroom that, more often than not, had to be disposed of because growers couldn't sell
them." <br>
---<i>The New Food Lover's Companion</i>, Sharon Tyler Herbst, 3rd edition [Barrons:New York] 2001 (p. 485)
<p>
"Portobellos are popping up on the nation's menus like mushrooms after a spring rain. From
soups and salads to sandwiches and entrees, the portobellos are everywhere. 
"It's a phenomenon in the food business," says Wade Whitfield of the Mushroom Council, an
industry trade group in Roseville, Calif. "This thing has gone from nearly zero in 1993 to a
predicted 30 million pounds this year. It's a major item. It will be the largest specialty
mushroom." And chefs have found portobellos their own specialty. 
Whitfield of the Mushroom Council said no one can put their finger on the precise development
of the portobello. "I've talked to several growers, and one said that he almost got fired once for
growing those things," Whitfield notes. "They are really culls. You didn't want them in the
mushroom bed. He would throw them away. There was no market. Growers would take them
home." Farges adds that most of the mushroom farmers, many in southeastern Pennsylvania,
were of Italian origin. They originally produced brown mushrooms, but the public clamored for
the white button variety because it was clean and pristine. In the 1960s and 1970s, with the back-to-earth movement, the growers again started producing the browns. "They are sometimes called
Romans, cremini or browns," Farges explains. "It has a much meatier flavor. It became a gourmet
item. By accident, they found that if you let it grow, it would grow into a portobello." 
White mushrooms are still 90 percent of the supply, but portobellos have taken a bite of the
market in the past four years. 
More growers are converting operations from white to portobellos in their mushroom houses,"
says Whitfield, adding that the move leads to a reduction in price. With the increased popularity,
however, comes a disagreement over the spelling of portobellos. Whitfield explains: "A great
deal of the growers are of Italian descent. I don't know who named it, but I understand portabella
means 'beautiful door.' With an instead of an 'a' in porto, it means 'beautiful port.'" 
The Mushroom Council prefers portabella, says Whitfield, but that's open to dispute. 
"To be honest, I've been here two and a half years, and portobellos were just coming on the
scene," he says. "We had five varieties, and portobellos became the sixth. I got to the sticky little
point of 'How do you spell it?' O's or A's? At the time I could identify six shippers who were
selling portobellos. I called all six of them, and asked, 'How do you spell portobello?' Four out of
six spelled it portabella."<br>

<a name="cremini">
<b>Cremini</b><p>
"The chubby cremino...properly encouraged by environmental conditions,
will metamorphose to a portly portobello (also portabella), a name as difficult to document as cremini. I asked
dozens who work with mushrooms, here and in Italy, about the name. The marketing director of a mushroom farm
told me, "It was named after Portobello Road in London, where they sell fashionable things, you know." An importer
said, "Until ten years ago, the mushroom was cappelaccio in Italy. Then it was renamed after a TV show called
Portobello  because it sounds better." Another importer told me that "portobello is known only in northern Italy,
where it is called capellone." To one authority, capellone means "big hat." To the director of an Italian trade board
and a dictionary it means "hippie." Two northern Italian chefs had never heard of capellone or cappelaccio. The most
outlandish derivation came from an Italian distributor: "Well, you know that champignon comes from the word for
Champagne, and that a Champagne cork looks like a round port and that's how we get porto bello  beautiful
port."

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Nutmeg</b></font><br>

Food historians place the epicenter of nutmeg's origin in the Moluccas (aka Spice Islands). This particular spice sparked a unique chain of economic and political events, making it a fascinating topic of study. When was it first commonly used in food? The answer depends upon the culture and cuisine. While print evidence confirms early uses in several continents, this spice was beyond the reach of the average British person until the mid-nineteenth century. Notes here: 
<p>
"Nutmeg...a kernel of the fruit of a tropical tree (Myristica fragrans), the dried nutmeg berry is called "nutmeg" because of its nutlike appearance. Nutmeg and macea re the only spices that come from the same fruit, with mace the aril of the dried seed. The nutmeg berry can be as small as an apricot or as large as a peach. An ancient spice, nutmeg is native to the Moluccas (the "Spice Islands") and was employed in South Asian cuisines for many centuries before it found its way to Rome, where Pliny wrote of a tree that bore a nut with two different tastes."
<br>---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kenneth F. Kiple & Kriemild Conee Ornelas [Cambridge University Press:Cambridge] 2000, Volume Two (p. 1823) 
<p>
"There is no record of nutmeg being known in classical Greece or Rome, but it had reached Constantinople by the 9th century AD, when St. Theodore the Studite allowed the monks who live by his Rule to sprinkle it on their pease pudding on non-meat days. By the 12th century it and mace were well known in Europe. When the Portuguese reached the Moluccas in 1514 they were able to acquire a monopoly on the trade, which they held for almost a century. At the beginning of the 17th century the Dutch wrestled control from them and laid the foundation of the Dutch E. Indian empire in the Bandanese island of Nehra, part of the Moluccas. They maintained their monopoly for over 150 years, but in 1770 a French expedition returned to Maruritius with nutmeg seedlings, and the first French nutmeg was picked eight years later. The British, who occupied the Moluccas from 1796 to 1802, planted nutmegs in Penang and therafter in other British possessions with seemingly suitable conditions, but it was not until the 1860s that cultivation of nutmegs in Grenada, which turned out to be the most suitable place for them, became significant."

<p>
"Etymologically, the nutmeg is the 'nut that smells of musk'. It is a partial translation of Old French nois mugeude, which came from a hypothetical Vulgar Latin nuce mascata, literally 'musky nut'...It seems to first to have been heard of in England in the fourteenth century, but it probably did not arrive in any quantity until the early sixteenth century, after the Portuguese had opened up the route round the Cape of Good Hope to the Moluccas and the other spice islands. In the mid-seventeenth century the Dutch seized the Moluccas, and Mrs. Beeton noted with some asperity that the nutmeg 'was long kept from being spread in other places by the monopolizing spirit of the Dutch, who endeavoured to keep it wholly to themselves by eradicating it from every other island'. By her time it had, however, 'through the enterprise of the British...found its way into Penang...where it flourishes and produces well'. In the eighteenth century gentlemen used to carry around with them small silver boxes which doubled as nutmeg holders and nutmeg graters, with which they would grate nutmeg into their hot chocolate drinks. The nutmeg has retained a foothold in the British kitchen ever since, particularly as a component of mixed spice used in cakes, puddings, etc."

"Cloves and nutmeg were the most exotic of all the costly ingredients in the 'royal perfume' of the Parthian court, in early Iran. This is just about the earliest textual evidence of the use of either spice anywhere in the world. In many later texts, likewise, they go together...An Elizabethan nutritionist advises nutmeg a s a healthy dietary supplement for students, especially the conserved or 'candied' nutmeg which was stocked by chemists...Far earlier, this was also the first form of nutmeg that reached China, In the fourth century JI Han writes of an aromatic 'resembling the brush tips of pens, but about three quarters of an inch in length,'...IN AD 203 the governor of Tonking presented Wu Ti of Wei with nutmeg conserves. If 'nutmeg' is the correct translation here--some think otherwise--we have to suppose that nutmegs afterwards ceased to reach the Middle Kingdom, because when they reappear in Chinese texts, in the eighth century, then have a different name, meaning literally 'flesh cardamom'. As with cloves, several Chinese authors insets--quite wrongly--that nutmegs grew in Indochina. Their mistake serves as good evidence that nutmegs reached China not by any direct route, coasting the Philippines and Taiwan, but by way of Java and Tonking. Tonking was, for centuries, the most southerly Chinese province and the place of entry for many exotic products from further south...To summarize: on the Chinese market nutmeg may have made a brief appearance in the third and fourth centuries, but reappeared in the eighth under a different name. Nutmeg is first recorded in Western markets around the same time...Nutmeg occurs in Greek texts of the ninth century, in French texts in the twelfth, in English texts by the fourteenth...nutmeg was among the spices the European explorers were most anxious to find...European nations would compete to possess the real nutmeg plantations when they discovered them, they would fight for the monopoly of the trade, and they did eventually succeed in breaking that monopoly and (whether they wanted to do this or not) in flooding the market and smashing the price."

"Some authorities...say that the earliest Chinese description of nutmeg is that of Ch'en Ts'ang-ch'i in T'ang times. The nutmeg is question came to China by merchant vessels from overseas, and it was called jou-tou-k'ou, one of its common names today. Recently...H.L. Li...identified as nutmeg...a plant called "o-chih-tzu," which was described by Chi Han in his flora (fourth century A.D.) Chi Han reported that i-chih-tzu was produced in what today are Annam and Kwangtung, and that early in the third century a governor of Chiao-chih sent a gift of i-chih-tzu preserves to Emperor Wu of Wei...The term i-chi-tzu in later times was used for bitter-seeded cardamom...but it Li is correct in his view that Chi Han's i-chih-tzu was nutmeg, the earliest Chinese knowledge of nutmeg would be foru or even five centuries earlier than most scholars had suspected. And the tree must have been introduced from the Spice Islands to Annam and mainland China still earlier, perhaps by the nan-Yueh seafarers who first carried cloves to China. Even if Li is wrong in his identification, the nutmeg tree seems to have been cultivated in Kwangtung or elsewhere in Longnan by the end of the eleventh century if not sooner...It is often difficult to classify a product as being primarily a spice or medicinal, but that is less of a problem for nutmeg in China...nutmeg in T'ang China apparently was a medicine but not a spice...a broth of ground nutmeg [was] given for digestive problems and diarrhea."

Okra is an "Old World" vegetable. The exact place of origin is still matter of debate. Over the
centuries, many cultures have embraced okra and used it to create traditional dishes.
Mediterranean and African recipes combined with tomatoes (a new world fruit) were created
after the Columbian Exchange. Okra was introduced to the New World by African slaves. This vegetable is still a
favorite in the American south. General overview (with picture)

"Okra is the edible seedpods of a tropical and subtropical plant of the hollyhock family...Africa is
the source of the name...which appears to be derived from or related to nkuruma, the word for
 'okra' in the Twi language of West Africa. It is first recorded in English at the beginning of the
eighteenth century. The mucilaginous pods, like miniature pentagonal green bananas, are an
essential ingredient in, and thickener of, soups and stews in countries where they are
grown...Other names of the polynomial okra include in English speaking countries lady's
fingers, in India bhindi, and in the eastern Mediterranean and Arab countries bamies."<br>

"Okra (Hibiscus esculentus)...and annual plant of tropical and subtropical regions which bears
pods which are eaten as a vegetable. It is the only member of the mallow family...to be used in
this way...Okra is generally regarded as native to Africa, and may have been first cultivated either
in the vicinity of Ethiopia or in W. Africa. It is not known when it spread from Ethiopia to N.
Africa, the E. Mediterranean, Arabia, and India. There is not trace of it in early Egyptian tombs,
but it was recorded as growing beside the Nile in the 13th century. Its westward migration to the
New World seems to have been a result of the traffic in slaves. Okra reached Brazil by 1658 and
Dutch Guiana by 1686. It may also have arrived in the south of the USA during the 17th century,
and was being grown as far north as Virginia and Philadelphia in the 18th century. The spread of
okra eastwards from India as slow. Its appearance in SE Asia may be assigned to the 19th
century, and it arrived in China soon therafter...Okra is only moderately popular in Europe...It is
used much more extensively in the Middle East and India, as a vegetable."<br>

<p>
"A native of Africa (most likely tropical Africa), okra was used by the Egyptians, was known to
the Spanish Moors in the twelfth century A.D., and in the late seventeenth century was carried by
slaves to the Americas. According to legend, okra was introduced to in southeastern North
America by the "Cassette Girls"--25 young French women who landed at Mobile in 1704 in
search of husbands. They had with them okra that had been obtained from slaves in the West
Indies, and which they used to invent "gumbo," which is a soup or stew thickened with okra.
Okra has played a major role in the cuisines of ex-slave societies in the Americas, where it
continues to be popular. It is also cultivated in Africa and East and South Asia."<br>

watermelon, for instance--but it is in the nature of things that we have no precise dates for their arrival."<br>

"Okra...derived from the West African nkruma, as in use in America by the 1780s. Okra was
brought to America by African slaves, who used it in stews and soups and cut it up as a
vegetable. The most famous use for okra is in Louisiana gumbo."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York]
1999 (p. 220)
<p>
"The word "okra" clearly derives from West African nkru ma, which indicates that the plant was brought to the 
Americas through the slave trade directly from Africa or indirectly through the Carribean. Slaves grew okra in gardens on 
southern plantations and introduced its cookery into mainstream America. The Swedish scientist Peter Kalm reported in his 
<i>Travels into North America</i> (1748) that okra was growing in Philadelphia. Thomas Jefferson, in his <i>Notes on the
State of Virginia</i> (1785), recorded that okra was cultivated there. Extensive directions for growing okra were
published in Robert Squibb's <i>The Gardener's Calendar for South Carolina, Georgia, and North Carolina</i> (1787). 
The pod of the opkra is steamed, boiled, fried, pickled, and cooked in soups and stews, notably gumbo. The seeds are also
ground into meal for use in making bread oand oil. Southerners used ground okra seeds as a coffee substitute, especially
during the Civil War...The leaves and flower buds are also edible and are cooked as greens. The pods and the leaves are dried, 
crushed into powder, and used for flavoring and thickening soups, including pepper pot, and stews. Although recipes for 
okra appear in early American cookery manuscripts, Thomas Cooper's edition of the <i>Domestic Encyclopedia</i> (1821) 
includes the first publsihed reicpe with okra as an ingredient. Mary Randolph's <i>Virginia House-wife</i> (1821) offers recipes 
using okra...The word "gumbo" or "gombo" is another African name for okra. In New Orleans it was applied to both the 
vegetable and the complex Creole stew made with it...Gumbos migrated quickly throughout America...Since the 1960s, okra has 
entered the American culinary mainstream, although as many writers point out, it is an acquired taste. It is a 
significant component of soul food and southern cookery in general."<br>

Ancient treasure to modern health: few foods rival the economic, social, symbolic and practical impact of olive 
oil on human history. 

  <p>
  "Olive oil, the main product of the olive and an extremely important food product of the ancient
  Mediterranean. Olive oil production involved three processes. The skin of the fruit must be first
  broken and the flesh crushed, preferably without breaking the stone. The pulp must then be
  pressed to release the oil. The oil must finally be separated from the watery amurca. Oil can be
  extracted without the use of presses, but mechanisation must have been important in the
  development of olive oil production. A beam press was in use in Ugarit (Syria) around 1500BC.
  Crushing mills and oil presses were widespread throughout the Mediterranean in Hellenistic and
  Roman times....Although olive oil is never a cheap product it is used generously in modern
  Mediterranean cuisines, as it clearly was in ancient cookery also. It served serveral food
  purposes. It was a medium for marinading meat and fish before cooking. It was a cooking
  medium. It was used as a dressing both for cooked food when served, and for fresh green
  vegetables; for this purpose it was sometimes used alone, sometimes mixed with vinegar and
  aromatic herbs. Finally it was used in conserving. Olive oil is one of the best cooking oils, since,
  apart from its unusual health benefits, it retains a good flavour and its boiling point is high. In
  ancient times it had no competition from cheaper vegetable oils, while in ancient Mediterranean
  cuisine animal fat was not used as a cooking medium. On the edges of the classical world olive oil
  was less well know. Pharaonic Egypt imported olive oil from Palestine and Crete. By the twelfth
  century BC olives were growing in Egypt, and Theophrastus confims that at the time of
  Alexander's conquest in the fourth century olives were grown for oil in the Thebaid, but this had
  been small-volume luxury production...As the principal vegetable oil of the ancient Mediterranean,
  olive oil had many non-food uses. It was a fuel, especially for lamps. It was a soap or cosmetic,
  used for rubbing the body...it was used for oiling clothes...Perfumed oils, used for burning as
  unguents, were made with the addition of various spices and aromatics...Both pure oil and
  perfumed oil were used in religious and social rituals."<br>
  ---<i>Food in the Ancient World From A-Z</i>, Andrew Dalby [Routledge:London] 2003 (p. 239-240)
<p>
"As Pliny says at the beginning of his chapter on oil: 'There are two liquids especially agreeable to the human body, wine inside
and oil outside.' In countries without the olive the place of oil was generally taken first by animal fat. That must have 
applied to ancient Italy before the introduction of the olive, but we have little direct evidence of this, for once
established, the olive became the universal provider...[Olives] appear to have originated in Syria and Palestine, whilst
aspiny variety may be indigenous to Crete. The olive industry must have played a vital role in Crete and much evidence
concerning it has come from that region. Its cultivation there goes back at least to 2500 BC. Olive stores of Late Minoan date have 
been found and also seeds and an olive press at Palaikastro. A number of settling vats have also been brought to light, and the
methods for extracting oil must have been much the same as those still employed in modern Crete. This involves drenching the
olives with hot water prior to pressing them; the resulting liquid is oured into vats which allow th oil to come to the top, the
water being then drawn off through a spout at the bottom. The significance of oil in early Crete becomes evident when one
considers the vast quantities of pithoi (pottery jars) in the storerooms of the palace at Knossos. Oil seems to have been
the king's treasure, and its export one of his major sources of revenue...There are also innumerable Biblical references to olives
and olive oil...Oil cultivation did not reach Italy until the sixth century BC and appears to have come via Greece, where 
domestication took place considerably earlier. Once olive oil reached Italy, its value was quickly appreciated...and the Romans soon
set themselves to work producing fruit and oil of varying kinds and quantities...All the Roman writers on agriculture give
full instructions to be followed when extracting olive oil. The olives should preferably be fresh when pressed. The first pressing
resulted in the first quality oil, the two subsequent pressings of the pulp gave second quality and ordinary oil."<br>

<b>Olive harvest notes from Cato [2nd century BC:Rome]</b><br>
"When the olives are ripe, they should be gathered as early as possible, and stand as little as possible on the ground
or in the loft. On the ground and in the loft they deteriorate. The gatherers want there to be as many windfalls as possible,,
so that they gather more. The press workers want them to be in the loft as long as possible, to soften, which makes their
work easier. Do not accept that oil yield increases with storage. The more quickly you make it, the better the work will go,
and the highter will be the quantity and quality of oil from the same amount harvested...Make green oil as follows: Collect windfall 
olives as quickly as possible. If dirty, wash them, clean them of leaves and manure. Make oil one day or two days after 
picking. Pick olives when black. The more bitter the olives you make oil from, the better the oil will be. Itg is most profitable
for the owner if oil is made from ripe olives. If there are frosts when you are harvesting olives, make oil two or three days
after: add salt to these olives, if you wish."<br>

  <b>Symbolism & mythology</b><br>
  "Olives and Olive Oil.
  Wild olive trees are indigenous to the eastern Mediterranean where thy line the low coastal areas
  of Greece and the surrounding islands. They're evergreen trees, and they've been cultivated int
  he Mediterranean and the Middle East since Neolithic times. Olives occupy a prominent place in
  mythology and custom, and the olive tree's branches and oil were used in much of the ancient
  world to bestow kingship, consecrate holy objects, and onont people of honor and bodies of the
  dead. The olive figures promenintly in the myths and customs of Greece, in particular, where it
  served as a symbol of peace and of constancy; an emblem of achievement; and a sacred,
  immortal, and divine fruit...The Greeks anointed the winners of the Olympian Games with olive oil
  to honor Athena, the goddess of the olive tree. Anointment with olive oil was a sign of respect in
  many lands in ancient times, and olive oil reputedly relieved tension and fatigue...Because the
  olive had to suffer (to be pressed) in order to produce riches (oil), the Greeks made it a symbol of
  victory over adversity. They also made it a symbol of regeneration and included it in immortality
  myths. Olive trees appeared to be immortal. They were known to live for centuries..."<br>

"Within fourteenth-century Spain, olive oil was exported from south to north...following the conquest of the New World, American demand continued to
stimulate Spain's olive oil industry. As the colonists began to make their own oil, however, the flow of Spanish olive oil across the Atlantic
diminished. In North America, Thomas Jefferson tried to grow olives at Monticello, but the cuttings he used would not take root...At about the
same time as this failed experiment in the east of the continent, olive cultivation was successfully launched in California by Spanish missionaries, and by the
beginning of the twentieth century, the western state had joined Provence in France and the Lucca district in Italy...as a produced of some of the
world's best olive oils." (p. 378) (Volume One p. 378)..."During the second quarter of the nineteenth century, the United States expanded, by conquest and by land purchase, into this large area [American
Southwest] with its predominently Hispanic population. The region's culinary heritage was rooted in part in the chilli-laced tamles and tortillas of the Aztecs and their

"Housewives would find it profitable to employ olive oil more generally for cooking, etc. In the average American household it is used only for salads and salad dressing, but it is also excellent for frying--it can be heated to higher temperature than either lard or butter and it has no disagreeable odor or flavor. Now is it expensive, in spite of the general impression to that effect, for one gallon of oil is equivalent to seven and a half pounds of butter for cooking.
After all deep frying, such as fritters, doughnuts or French fried potatoes, the oil should be carefully strained and placed in a clean, tight bottle for further use."<br>

again the onion was regarded as a peasant food. Accounts dating from the Third Dynasty of Ur (early second millennium BC) state that on
one day each month various persons received a ration of about a 'gallon' of bread and some onions. They were usualy eaten raw with 
bread and were sold in strings...Archaeological surveys have not as yet brought to light any material proof of this type of 
vegetabes in Greece...Theophrastus (c. 372-c. 287 BC) was acquainted with a number of varieties of onion and garlic and bother wsere undoubtedly

<b>Onion symbolism & folkore</b><br>
"The onion was likely one of the first plants cultivated. Its layered structure and pungent odor so
impressed the ancients that they developed beliefs about the onion that have survived to the
present day. The offensive odor of the onion led many to fear its power. Its appearance and
structure, however, fostered a different view: The onion was likened by some to a pearl-gold on
the outside and white on the inside; and like a pearl, they thought, it symbolized oneness and
unity. Furthermore, the onion was spherical in shape, consisting of a series of orbs, one inside the
other...Because the onion and leek symbolized the universe, the ancient Egyptians considered the
bulbs sacred..."<br>

"At the time when Columbus discovered America, the Indians were using two thousand different foods derived from plants...
Another underground plant which Indians ate avidly was the onion. Some writers have tried to deny them this plant, claiming it 
was unkown in America until Europeans brought it there; however Bernal Diaz, who accompanied Cortes in Mexico, remarked about 1520 that 
wooden objects made by the Indians...smelled strongly of onion and garlic, and he seems to have been an alert observer. It is 
possible that this effect could have been produced by the native American onion-flavored ramps, but it is unnecessary to seek
such an explanation. The fact is that native onions did grow wild in America...and Indians were fond of them."<br>

"Most of America's early settlers brought with them whatever they needed to reestablish their gardens on the new continent.
And they always brought onions. Onions could make people weep, but they made any dish taste better. The bulbs were resistent
to decay and could last all winter in the root cellar. Onions are very climate and soil sensitive, so European onions had to be
adapted selectively to local growing conditions. Kitchen gardens of the eighteenth century tended to rely on imported onions
for seed stock because seeds saved from domestically grown onions often deteriorated. After the Revolutionary War, growers started
adapting varieties to different American climates. Many of the onion varieties in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
were derived from the imported English globe onion and were suited for the cooler New England and Mid-Atlantic
climates. Other varieties, successful in southern conditions, were developed from Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian stock...Colonists and 
pioneers also used some of the dozens of onion cousins that grew wild in America...American cookbooks were full on onions, first
showing up in 1796, when Amelia Simmons published the first American cookbook. She called for roasting the turkey on a spit and
serving it up "with boiled onions and cramberry [sic] sauce, mangoes, pickles and celery."<br>

"One way to categorize this fruit of the genus Citrus is to distinguish bitter oranges...from sweet
oranges...The bitter orange (also known as Sevilla, sour orange...) is a native of Southeast Asia
and was cultivated in the Indus Valley some 6,000 years ago. The sweet orange...may also have
originated in Southeast Asia, although many believe it to be a native of southern China, as is
evidenced by its scientific name. Both fruits were slow to find their way to the Mediterranean
basin; the bitter orange eventually arrived with the Arabs around A.D. 1000, but the Western
advent of the sweet orange came more than 400 years later, perhaps with the help of Genoese
traders or Portuguese explorers. Sweet-orange trees were planted at Versailles in 1421, and later
(1521) in Lisbon. Meanwhile, in 1493, the second voyage of Christopher Columubus is said to
have carried sweet-orange seeds...to Hispaniola, and Spaniards stationed in Florida were
reportedly growing oranges there in 1565, the year St. Augustine was founded. A couple of
centuries later, the Franciscans began planting orange groves at their mission of San Diego in
California."<br>

"The orange is one of the most important fuits of the world and one of the oldest cultivated.
Originating in the Orient, the fruit was cultivated in China as early as 2400 B.C. These were
"bitter oranges"...later brought to Spain, where they became known as the "Seville orange." The
"sweet orange"...also originated in China and was also brought to Spain, possibly by the Moors
in the eighth century. Christopher Columbus brought Canary Islands orange seeds to Hispaniola
in 1493, and plantings by the Spanish and Portuguese soon followed throughout the Caribbean,
Mexico, and South America. Some believe Ponce de Leon brought orange seeds to Florida, but
the first recorded evidence of the fruit on North American soil credits Hernando de Soto with
bringing the orange in 1539 to St. Augustine, Florida, where the trees flourished until Sir Francis
Drake sacked the city in 1586 and destroyed them. These grew back quickly, but commercial
plantings were of only minor importance for more than two centuries...In Florida only one
significant orange grower was to be found in the eighteenth century. His name was Jesse Fish...It
was not until the United States acquired Florida in 1821 that orange growing became a profitable
business for Americans...By the 1880s orange production was growing rapidly, owing to the
development of refrigerated ships that could carry the fruit from California and to the building of
railroads into the heart of Florida. Also, a new orange, the "navel"...entered California in 1873
from Bahia, Brazil...By the 1890s, the navel orange had become commercially important...By the
1920s nutritionists were promoting the benefits of orange juice...and the drink became as
ubiquitious as coffee on American breakfast tables."<br>

"Citrus cultivation in the area that would become the United States dates from the Spanish
exploration and settlement of Florida in the sixteenth century; it reached Louisiana around 1700
and California with the arrival of Franciscan friars in 1769. Since most citrus cannot tolerate
temperatures more than a few degrees below freezing, open-air cultivation has generally been
limited to warmer areas, but until the second half of the nineteenth century it was not uncommon
for the wealthy to grow oranges and lemons in greenhouses. With the advent of steam
transportation in the mid-nineteenth century, citrus was imported from Mexico, the West Indies,
and Italy. Large-scale commercial cultivation began in Florida and California in the 1870s and
1880s, when the extension of railroads allowed fresh fruit to be shipped to major eastern and
midwestern markets. Railroads and land promoters helped fashion a romantic image of citrus in the
popular imagination, symbolizing sunshine, health, and elegance, to lure settlers to Florida and
California. To sell their corps profitably, growers formed marketing cooperatives, such as
Sunkist, founded as the Southern California Fruit Exchange in 1893."<br>

<b>Symbolism & mythology</b><br>
"Oranges are native to Southeastern Asia. The ancient Egyptians knew nothing of this fruit, and the Greeks made no mention
of them either; but the Chinese cultivated them in antiquity, and the Japanese identified them as the fruit of life. In Japanese
myth, the emperor sent a hero named Tajima-mori to the Eternal Land, possibly southern China, to bring back the magical
fruit, so that the emperor might gain immortality. But Tajima-mori returned too late. The emperor had already died, and the
magic of oranges could no longer help him. Though the Chinese identified the fruit of life as the peach, they considered oragnes
magical also, believing that the fruit brought good luck and joy and warded off evil spirits. Oranges possibly gained respect
in myth and legend because of their color. Ancient peoples seem to have believed that orange or red fruits had magical properties,
connecting them with blood and life force. The golden color of oranges also led some mythmakers to link them with the sun. In Flemish
legend, a young prince once went in search of a bride hidden within a magic orange in a land of sunshine and orange 
groves..."<br>

<b>Why give oranges at Christmas?</b><br>
Food historians trace the practice of proferring fresh fruit gifts for major celebrations to ancient times. These exquisite, perishable
objects were expensive and reflected the giver's wealth and status. Indeed, before the age of speedy transportation and 
reliable refrigeration, fresh citrus fruit was out of reach of the average person. As time progressed, fresh fruit out of 
season (including oranges in Northern Europe and/or North America) was possible, but still rare. This made these items perfect
Christmas gifts. Today, when oranges are inexpensive and readily available throughout the year, this little history tidbit is overlooked. 
A child today who encounters an orange at the toe of his Christmas stocking is unlikely to appreciate the message unless someone
takes the time to share the history.
<p>
"Strange and exotic fruits had begun to reach Britain...through trade with southern Europe where oranges, lemons and pomegranates were cultivated. The original 
home of the citrus fruits lay in northern India. They had been known to the Romans under the name of "Median apples', having apparantly arrived from Persia; and
 their juice had been used as a medicine, and occasionally also to sharpen the tang of vinegar...The first Englishmen to enjoy oranges, lemons and 'Adams apples'...
were probably crusaders who wintered with Richard Coure-de-Lion in the fruit groves around Jaffa in 1191-2. About a hundred years later citrus fruits had begun
 to arrive in England itself...Also on the spice ships  from southern Europe came great raisins, 'raisins of Corinth' or currants...prunes, figs and dates. All were
 consumed in vast quantities by the well-to-do, for the sweetness of dried fruits was greately appreciated while sugar was still rare and expensive. Poorer people ate
 them principally in festive pottages and pies during the twelve days of Christmas, but the rich enjoyed them at other times , too."<br>

<b>Blood oranges</b><br>
Despite popular belief, these sumptuous sweet citrus fruits are not new. Nor were they first imported to the USA by Frieda Caplan. They have however, enjoyed the benefit of 
recent promotion and chef creativity.  Botantists confirm sweet oranges originated in China and India. Specific variety migrations are complicated to track because they rely primarily
on literature, folklore and personal accounts. Linguistics, translation and interpretation play key roles. The locus of origin centers on Sicily and/or Malta. 
Citrus experts tell us the blood red color was a logical mutation caused by climate. They do not offer a date of "discovery." Print evidence confirms sweet oranges were growing in 
this region by the 17th century. Recent references to 4th century Chinese origin are based on English translations of ancient Chinese literature. It is not possible to say for sure 
whether the red fruits of these poems were actually blood oranges.
<p> 
<b>Old world</b><br>
"Blood oranges are grown mostly in Mediterranean countries, especially Italy. The original mutation which produced the colour probably arose in the 17th century in Sicily. The earliest 
blood oranges were small and seedy but the better varieties which followed, notably Sanguinello, attracted international esteem. The best modern varieties include the round early-
season Moro and the mid-season Tarocco (named for its resemblance to a child's toy top renown for its delicate flesh and well-balanced flavour). Sicily, especially the area around 
Catania, remains the best place for these oranges...Connoisseurs of citrus fruits consider these oranges to be among the world's finest dessert oranges." <br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2006, 2nd edition (p. 559-560) <br>
[NOTE: there are several conflicting opinions regarding the introduction of sweet oranges to southern Europe. Period ranges from 15-17 century.] 
<p>
"Blood orange...A very large variety of sweet orange, the blood orange (Citrus sinesis) has juice that is usually of a burgundy hue, which along with the red color of its flesh, accounts 
for the name. Blood oranges (also called pigmented oranges) are a favorite in Europe...but have not really caught on in the United States, although the 'Ruby Blood' and 'Moro' varieties 
are grown in California and Florida. Blood oranges come mostly from Spain and Italy; important European varieties include the Spanish Sanguinella and the 'Maltese Blood.' The English 
call these fruits 'Maltese oranges,' the French 'Maltaise oranges'." <br>

"[in] Sicily, one encounters another orange variety. This is a sweet, not a bitter, fruit, It is attractive not only to the mouth and the nose, but also to the eye, and to the inward eye of 
imagination and fantasy: its juice is blood red...Whereas an island such as Sicily can become a melting pot of cultures, its territory is naturally isolated...Insularity may account...for the 
appearance of blood oranges in Sicily as an accidental variety...When did they first appear? It would seem to be several centuries ago, but exactly when remains in doubt. The product of 
this mutation has turned into a significant economic resource. Blood oranges account for about 60 percent of Italian citrus production and fetch a good price on European markets.
 Consumers consider them a delicacy....Like the setting sun, the fruit is reddish orange. Its outer color is an excellent predictor of its inner hues. These oranges are small or medium in 
size, and they carry seeds and a blood-colored juice that usually tastes a little more tart than that of ordinary oranges...Blood oranges owe their color to dye molecules, often improperly
 referred to as pigments. A pigment is an insoluble solid, in contrast to a dye, which is soluble and colors the liquid dissolving it. These blood-colored molecules belong to the same 
chemical families that are responsible for the color of...cherries, strawberries, and raspberries...As the fruit matures, the amount of dye increases about fivefold...Citrus fruit in a tropical or
 subtropical climate devoid of sharp winter-summer alternation tends to remain lime green....Citrus fruit growing in a temperate climate with sharply defined seasons first turns orange 
and tends to redden upon further maturation. This genetic trait has accidentally become selected in the blood oranges of Sicily. On the terraced orchards on the slopes of Mt. Etna in 
eastern Sicily where blood oranges are grown, cold winter nights alternating with mild days are the cue for the fruit to blush. Besides carotenoids, brightly colored anthocyanins, some 
red, some purple, and some violet, give there fruits their berrylike taste and color." <br>

capital of which (Manila) it, together with the well-known cigars formed at one time one of the chief articles of export. On its first appearance in Europe it excited a considerable 
sensation; and in the last century very high prices were demanded for the trees which bore the wonderful fruit. None, however, now come to us from Manila, our supply being derived 
almost entirely from Malta, where great pains and attention are bestowed upon their cultivation. It was for a long time supposed and indeed the idea is not yet quite extinct, that blood

common ritual offerings, and one also reads of small mandarin trees in homes at the time of Chinese New Year...This is because their
colors are religious and magical, life-sustaining, capable of warding off evil spirits and assuring good luck...Mandarin trees
are adaptable to a wider range of climatic conditions than other types of cultivated citrus. They are better able to stand heat
than most other types. They also tend to be more cold resistant than other citrus trees of commercial importance, though the furit,
mainly because it is small and thin-skinned, is more readily damaged by cold than are other oranges...As a result, mandarins are gown
in all of China's citrus-producting regions: South China, West China, Wouthwest China,...Central China, and Northwest China. Though
the mandarins are the largest and most varied group of cultivated citrus, their fruit possess the common characteristics
of small to medium size; shape like a flattened globe; a  loose, readily removed skin, yellow or reddish orange in color; and 
fruit segments that are separated with out difficulty. The mandarin is suffiently different from other oranges as to lead

India as the place of the earliest domestication of the mandarin oranges. Hodgeson...argues for northeast India as their probable
home. In that area, there occurs a primitive, related form sometimes called the "Indian wild mandarin"...also found there are
highly developed forms of mandarins that are absent elsewhere, as well as many mandarin hybrids. The mandarin was cultivated
in very early times in Southeast Asia and East Asia, with both of those regions important in developing mandarin forms. In the
early fourth century A.D., Chi Han had already distinguished red and yellow forms of mandarins...in the south, and of them the
famous variety known in present-day Canton and the West as Ponkan or "Chinese honey orange."...Accounts form T'ang times mention 
highly-prized varieties of common mandarisn and King mandarins, the latter...believed to be a natural hybrid, perhaps betweeen 
mandarin and sweet orange...Mandarins seem to have been grown  enve in the gardens of the imperial palace
far to the north of Shensei, apparently in some sort of greenhouse...a situation reminiscent fo the orangeries or orange-houses
of ancient Rome and later Europe...Many mandarin varieties are grown in South China today, of which two deserve special note.
one is the afore-mentioned Ponkan, which produces large fruit with loose skin and pleasant-tasting, juicy flesh, and which can
be picked in October. It is said to be the finest mandarin produced in China, in East Asia, and perhaps in the entire
world. The Cheokan, known better as Tankan, is an ancient form which originated in southeastern China."<br>

robes of the Chinese civil servants called Mandarins. It worked its way toward the Near East at a leisurely pace and reached
Europe directly from China only at the beginning of the nineteenth century. By midcentury, Mandarin oranges were being

"The mandarin is a small loose-skinned somewhat flattened variety of orange...that originated in China. The first reference to it
in English comes in 1771, in J.R. Foster's translation of Osbeck's Voyage to China: 'Here are two sorts of China oranges...The
first is called the Mandarin-o, whose peel is quite loose'. English acquired the word, via French, from Spanish mandarina, where
its application to the fruit probably arose from the resemblance of its colour to that of the yellowish-orange robes of
Chinese imperial officials--mandarins (this term is not Chinese in origin, incidentally; it first arrived in Europe as a 
Portuguese borrowing from Malay mantri, 'counsellor', which was itself a Hindi loanword that orignated in Sanskrit

"Mandarin was originally no more than a nickname given to a small, loose-skinned orange-like fruit. Citrus reticulata, which was 
brought to England from China in 1805...The original wild citrus from which mandarins are descended probably grew in 
NE India, where a wild mandarin, C. indica, is still found. It was taken into cultivation at an early date in S. China, as were 
other kinds of orange. However, mandarins were more highly esteemed than common oranges, partly because ancient varieties
of the latter were dry, thick skinned, hard to peel, and seedy. The mandarin was prized as much for its fragrance as for its
flavour, perhaps more...Mandarins were not taken to the West along with the other citrus fruits, whcih had all reached
Europe by the 16th century. And when they did come it was through another route. The first cultivars (probably of the ponkan
type...) were brought to England in 1805, and it was apparently the descendants of these which were introduced into Italy
in the following decade and which had become well established there before 1850. From Italy, cultivation spread quickly to
other Mediterranean countries. Meanwhile, mandarins had been take direct from China to Australia in the 1820s. But it was not
until the 1840s that the first mandarin was grown in the USA, but the Italian consul in New Orleans. Cultivation soon 
spread to Florida, California, and other states, and the new fruits were at first...called 'Chinas'. Later, when different, darker

Parsley is one of the most well known herbs from ancient times to present day. This Old World edible was prized early on for
its subtle flavors and appealing look. Of the several varieties cultivated by humankind, curly-leaved and flat Italian are
the most well known. Arguments extolling the virtues of flat vs. curly vary according to place and period. All varieties are recognized
for their healthful properties. Ancient Greeks honored their Olympic athletes with crowns of parsley.

"Parsley in an umbelliferous plant native to the E. Mediterranean area (Linnaeus believed that its origin was in
Sardinia) and related to celery, with which it has occasionally formed hybrids. The ancient Greeks used the
name selinon for both parsley and celery, and only occasionally bothered to distinguish parsley as
petroselinon, meaning  'rock' celery or parsley. Later the Romans used the word apium in a similarly
ambiguous way. Thus it is difficult to tell which is meant. However, the Greek writer Theophrastus, writing
before 300BC, describes curly-leafed and flat-leafed varieties of parsley similar to the two main modern types.
According to Pliny the Elder (1st century AD), the Romans held parsley fronds in particular esteem among
seasonings..."<br>

"The aromatic leaves of parsley (Petroselinum crispum), a native of southern Europe, are employed for
flavoring, although parsley varieties are boiled and their roots consumed as a vegetable. The use of parsley
dates from at least the time of the ancient Greeks, and because the plant has been introduced to most areas
of the glove, it is one of the world's best-known herbs. According to the Sardinians, it is native to their island,
although other regions also claim parsley as their own; regardless, it has been used in the Mediterranean
region for thousands of years. The Greeks, who made crowns of it to honor athletes at ceremonies and
themselves at banquets, also had medical uses for the herb. The Romans utilized parsley as a herb an
introduced the plant throughout Europe."<br>

linguistic ancestor has been in the language since Anglo-Saxon times, although the plant itself was not
introduced it in Britain (from southern Europe) until the late Middle Ages. The earliest record of the word,
petersilie...from around 1000AD, clearly reveals its ultimate source: it goes back, via Latin petroselinum, to

<b>Fast forward: 20th century USA</b><br>
Our survey of articles published in major USA newspapers confirms both curly-leaved and flat Italian varieties were both known and used in the 20th century. The
curly-leaf variety, prized for its decorative applications, reigned supreme until the last quarter of the century. It was 
not until after WWII that the flat variety was known outside ethnic neighborhoods. This parallels the evolution of many popular contemporary Italian foods. Think: 
<a href="foodpies.html#pizza">pizza</a>. Curly parsley "lost favor" in the 1970s. The reason was two-fold (1) Curly parsley garnish was 
overdone/ubiquitous in the 1960s.  (2) Culinary visionaries James Beard and Craig Claiborne extolled the virtues of flat-leafed parsley as more flavorful.

Parsley is said to be a native of Egypt but it is now thoroughly naturalized both here and in several European countries. The variety

flavoring qualities, parsley contains an essential oil which is mildly stimulating." <br>

"Seldom on display, fresh green parsley can be bought at most greengroceries at any time of the year. In cold weather, when it is not available from near-by sources, 
it is shipped north from Texas in qualtities to meet all the demand. But when it does come from farms in New Jersey and on Long Island, as it will from 
now through the summer, parsley is at its best. The flavor is sharper, the leaves are crisper, and logically so because it has a much shorter trip 
to market...The more common parsley, at least in most stores, is the curly leaved variety. But in neighborhoods where many Americans of Italian 
or other European background live, the shops will be sure to have a variety of parsley that has a flatter leaf and a darker green color. 
That parsley, Italians insist--and others who have tasted it will agree--has a sharper flavor than the curly leafed. The two 
varieties can be used interchangeably whenever parsley is called for in a recipe. For garnishing meats or fish, the curly and prettier 
parsley is preferred." <br>

attributed to the plant by ancient Greeks, who placed garlands of parsley on the heads of banquet guests. Today, parsley grows 
both in the United States and several European countries. It is exceptionally high in vitamins A and C. Although the curly leaf variety 
is popular, the flat leaf type, sometimes called Italian parsley, also is used here." <br>

"Parsley is being used more and more as a garnish, seasoning and a vegetable. Though a biennial, parsley is generally treated as an 
annual here in the Northeast, where it may or may not survive the winter. ..The curly-leaved parsleys are most popular. They include Moss Curled, 
another named variety Paramount, and a compact dwarf parsley. Evergreen is a rather hardy curled variety. Plain parsley (leaves 
are deeply cut but not curled), though not so pretty, has a strong, rich flavor. Giant Italian parsley, 2-3 feet tall, has thick stalks to 
be eaten like celery. The roots of hamburg parsley can be stored inside in sand and used through winter to flavor soups, or can themselves 
be cooked like parsnips. This year for the first time I shall try the Japanese perennial; parsley, Misuba...Biennial parsleys--most parsleys-- 
should be sown each year; even if they live over, the foliage tastes better the first year." <br>

"It is rather amusing to think that parsley, probably the most used of all herbs, was once considered Satan's herb. There was an old 
saying in England that only the wicked could grow parsley. Well, the world must be full of wicked people because it is grown and 
marketed in staggering quantities. Parsley, either the curly kind which has become the perpetual garnish for food or the broad-leaf Italian 
kind which has a much more delicate flavor, is one of the easiest of all herbs to grow in the garden...Just because parsley is so 
common, people tend to overdo it as a garnish. For instance, who could conceive of parsley as a fitting garnish for grapefruit?...Even 
top rated restaurants and hotels perpetrate some absolute horrors, such as a slice of orange and a sprig of parsley on a plate of 
sausages and pancakes." <br>

"Although parsley is omnipresent in kitchens, particularly those of the Western world, it is generally regarded as nothing more than a 
basic flavor, something to be added reflexively to one savory dish or another--a kind of culinary grace note. Actually, there are numerous dishes 
in the world in which parsley, in one form or another, is used in dominant--or near dominant--fashion. Chief among these is the famed 
jambon persille, a great specialty of Burgundy...There are two basic kitchen parsley available on the market. These are the plain, or flat leaf, and the 
curly leaf varieties. The commonest both in England and in the United States is the curly leaf, although it is not necessarily the best. The flat 
or plain leaf is much more used and admired in the countries around the Mediterranean, particularly Italy. Flat leaf parsley, as a matter of fact, is 
usually referred to in the United States as Italian parsley. In Tom Stobbart's laudable book, <i>Herbs, Spices and Flavorings</i>, he notes that 
Neapolitan parsley is a specialty grown in Naples for its stems, which are eaten in the same manner as celery. There is a also Hamburg 
parsley, of which only the foot is used for flavoring. Chinese parsley, of course, is not parsley at all but rather the leaf of the coriander 
plant." <br>

fish chiefly to provide a touch of green, unceremoniously removed to the bread plate, if not the ashtray, by fully half the 
diners in America...As between curly and flat parsley, it is probably safe to say that most cooks who use parsley extensively in their 
cooking prefer the flat. It has more taste and it incorporates itself more gracefully into a dish than does its stiffly coiffed 
cousin." <br>

"Parsley may be ignored at dinner, but it is the favorite herb of most produce-department managers. It is the only food they sell that almost no one eats, thus 
thus minimizing customer complaints about how it tastes. They never have to answer tricky questions about ways to prepare it, since 
even inexperienced cooks know how to toss clumps of parsley onto dinner plates. They never have to worry about its being out of season, and they 
don't even have to convince anyone to replenish his supply. In fact, people have always thought of ways to consume lots of 
parsley without actually eating it. One old preventive for baldness, for example, required dusting the head with considerable 
amounts of powdered parsley seed several times a year...parsley hasn't always been ignored at the table...and its origins are probably 
Mediterranean, judging from its appearance in virtually all ancient Roman sauces and salads. It is one of the oldest and most 
universally used herbs in history. More recently, the discovery of parsley's nutritional value has led some people to reconsider it 
as a serious edible. A cup of chopped raw parsley provides almost as much vitamin C as an orange, or about half the amount of a cup of 
fresh orange juice. The herb yields almost as much vitamin A as raw spinach. In addition, it contains calcium, copper, iron, manganese, potassium 
and phosphorus, as well as the B vitamins riboflavin, thiamin and niacin. With so much to offer, parsley is often as nutritious 
as the food it adorns. Parsley also tastes good, although experts debate over which of the two most common varieties has the 
superior flavor. The frilly-or curly-leafed parsley is more widely available and certainly the more decorative. But many prefer Italian 
parsley, which has broader, flat leaves, deeper color and more robust taste. Hamburg parsley, a potherb used by the Germans, the 
Dutch and the Poles, is a lesser-known type, whose leaves are usually ignored altogether. It is cultivated for its delicious, 
carrot-shaped root, which makes it look like an anemic parsnip. Still other greens have become known as parsley, although they 
are nothing of the kind. So-Called Japanese or Chinese parsley, similar in appearance to the Italian, is actually fresh coriander. The 
inedible 'fools parsley' also looks like the flat-leafed kind, but has won the additional nickname of 'dog's poison'...Connoisseurs...know that 
real parsley can enliven many a recipe. For the French, it is an essential component of beurre maitre d'hotel (parsley butter)... 
bouquets garnis and fines herbes...But in contemporary recipes, parsley seems to have lost its role as flavoring to more exotic 
herbs...Because of its profusion and availability, parsley has become an inexpensive and universal choice for a decorative 
addition." <br>

"Like a hero of Greek tragedy, parsley has fallen victim to its own virtues. Long-lasting, attractive and readily available in large 
quantities at every grocer store, parsley should be our most honored herb. Instead, its very availability has made it seem common, while its 
sturdiness and brilliant green color have consigned it to the thankless role of an eye-pleasing decoration scraped off the plate with the 
leftovers when the meal has ended. But this ignominious fate ignores the single virtue that has placed parsley high on the list of the 
world's most widely used herbs-its great flavor. Mild, slightly grassy, with an echo of mint and a slight undertone of bitterness, parsley's 
taste is a bedrock component of our flavor vernacular. In these winter months, when other fresh herbs have soared in price and taken 
a nose dive in quality, try making parsley the herb of choice. In addition to its pleasing flavor, parsley also possesses and 
easygoing, agreeable disposition. It will grow in almost any climate, and unlike its striking herbal cousins like cilantro and 
rosemary, it will blend with a wide range of flavors. Perhaps because of its Mediterranean origins, it harmonizes most easily with other 
foods from the region, like capers, garlic, olive oil, lemons and tomatoes...Evidence of parsley's versatile and accommodating nature 
is found in cuisines all over the world. French chefs uses parsley in their most popular herbal mixtures, from bouquet garni to fines 
herbes...While there are about 30 varieties of parsley, including some grown for stems and at least one used only for its roots, 
most American cooks find themselves choosing between two varieties, flat leaf and curly leaf. In practice, the two can be used 
more or less interchangeably, but there are some differences. Common wisdom holds that flat leaf has a more intense flavor than curly 
leaf. Repeated tasting bear this out, but the difference is not a pronounced as generally advertised. Flavor intensity actually 
varies more between individual bunches of the herb than between varieties. So, with parsley, you should follow the same rule of thumb 
as with all other produce: the fresher variety is probably the better choice. If both varieties seem equally fresh, consider the intended 
use. Most flat-leaf parsley has larger leaves and thicker stems than curly leaf, which makes it easier to strip off the leaves. Curly 
leaf, with stronger stems and a generally sturdier character, might be preferable for salads with a lot of crunch." <br>

"Parsley is the herb that's taken for granted. A few sprigs solve the garnish problem. A scattering of chopped leaves enlivens almost 
any dish with a bright bit of green. But parsley can take a more assertive role, becoming the primary component of a sauce. Not only 
can it stand in for basil in a pesto, it can also be the basis of a variety of green sauces...Flat-leaf Italian parsley is usually 
preferred by chefs for its richer flavor. Curly parsley makes a prettier garnish." <br>
---"Parsley Takes a More Assertive Role," Florence Fabricant, <i>New York Times</i>, April 14, 1996 (p. CN14) 
<p>
<b>[1997] </b><br>
"Like salt, parsley is a seasoning that orchestrates other flavors. So deftly does it do its job that it is usually taken for 
granted. This lack of praise is not reflected in the medical folklore, where parsley is touted as an effective cure for 
rheumatism, swelling and lethargy. The Romans used parsley to stimulate circulation and appetite. And in recent years, the sales of 
parsley capsules have increased right along with the wholesale consumption of garlic. We do know for certain that parsley does 
for cooking what people claim it does for health--namely, clean and refresh. With its hint of camphor, citrus and grass, and its 
subtle peppery bite, parsley cuts fat and grease and lends a youthful kick to almost any dish. Although there are five botanical 
varieties of parsley, only two are commonly employed: curly-leafed parsley--so decorative, it is used as a garnish--and flat-leaf or 
Italian parsley, also called celery-leaf parsley, which has thick, deep-green leaves and a decidedly blunt taste. Sardinia claims to 
be parsley's homeland, but that may have more to do with its widespread use there than its actual point of origin. Parsley 
is a hardy, prolific herb that has been growing for thousands of years all over the world. Its affinity for the cooking of southern 
Italy is only natural, since it is the ultimate counterpoint to bold, boisterous flavors. And while flat-leaf parsley is 
perfectly capable of playing a supporting role, it has enough flavor to be able to define a dish, tabblouleh being the perfect 
example." <br>

<b>[1998] </b><br>
"Parsley is, without a doubt, the most underrated herb in the United States. We fuss over basil, fall in and out of love with 
cilantro, experiment with lavender and nearly ignore parsley. Still, the situation has improved over the years; when I was growing 
up it wasn't even clear that parsley was edible--a few sprigs on the side of the plate merely served notice that the dish was 
somehow 'fancy.' Yet when you get past using parsley as a garnish, and sprinkle a handful on top of a dish just before serving, you 
begin to appreciate the bright, clean flavor of this common herb. And when you realize that it remains in season far longer than 
basil, rosemary or other popular herbs...you get a further sense of its value. My love for parsley increased even more when 
I learned how to feature it in sauces...I've learned to blend it with vinegar to make a sharp, spiky sauce that complements 
simply prepared, full-flavored foods beautifully." <br>

Pasta, in many shapes and forms, has been enjoyed by many cultures and cuisines for
thousands of years.  Who invented this food, where and when? That's very much a matter of
culinary debate. Current evidence suggests two (or more) concommitant centers of origin.
Ancient and Medieval pasta dishes were both savory (made with meat, pepper, onion, saffron) and
sweet (made with honey, nuts, and soft cheeses). According to the food historians, layered &
stuffed pastas (lasagne, ravioli) are a Medieval invention. In European/Christian cultures they
were often served with cheese during Christian Lent and other meat-abstaining days. <p>17th and

<B>What about Marco Polo?</b><br>
Food historians debunk the myth that Marco Polo introduced pasta to Italy as a result of his
travels to China. Notes here:
<p>
"Certain ideas about the history of food are part of the general cultures. We all know, or think we
know, that pasta originated in China, that it was brought back to Venice by Marco Polo, and that
it spread from there first throughout Italy and later to the rest of Europe...It is an extravagant
application to the realm of food...called the "myth of origin." Yet histories that confidently repeat
widely held opinions often neglect contradictory evidence. For example, the sources how that
pasta did not come to Italy from China by way of Venice but spread northward from the
Mezzogiorno, where noodles were eaten long before Marco Polo traveled to the Orient."<br>
---<i>Food: A Culinary History</i>, Jean-Louis Flandrin & Masssimo Montanari [Columbia
University Press:New York] 1999 (p. 1-2)
<p>
"Culinary mythology: Marco Polo's supposed introduction of pasta from China to the Western
world. This durable myth, which requires that nothing should have been known of pasta in Italy
until 1295, when Marco Polo returned from the Far East, can easily be shown to be wrong by
citing references in Italy to pasta of an earlier date. What is interesting about the myth is the
question of how it arose. An explanation was offered to a distinguished audience at Oxford
University by the famous Italian authority, Massimo Alberini:  As far as I can make out, the
 Chinese' story originates from an article entitled  A Saga of catai  that appeared in the American
magazine <i>Macaroni Journal</i> in 1929. There it was written that a sailor in Marco Polo's
expedition had seen a Chinese girl preparing long strands of pasta, and that the sailor's name was
Spaghetti. Obviously an "unlikely tale." It is tempting to add that the Macaroni Journal
explanation
may itself be a myth; but no better explanation has been offered. The question of interaction
between oriental and occidental forms of pasta and the extent to which particular forms may have
travelled either eastwards or westwards, through C. Asia, is a different one, of a subtlety and
complexity sufficient to deter myth-makers from trying to intervene with it."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
232) 88 (p. 273-4)           
<p>
The very real contribution Marco Polo made with regards to introducing foods of Asia to Europe
was his description of the cuisine and dining habits of the people he met on his journeys. 
<P>
"Marco Polo's accounts of China are too well known to warrant further attention, but a word
needs to be said about his reliability. John Haeger, among others, has questioned whether Marco
Polo saw as much as we usually assume...There is no question that he relied on others'
acounts--usually reliable ones, but sometimes rumors--for his descriptions of some remote,
off-route
places... Of Yuan food, Marco tells us a good deal, all of it confirmed by others. The importance
of dairy products, especially horse milk, is clear. Dried skim milk was a staple...Wine is described
as being made of rice and flavored with spices...The luxury of the Great Kaan's table service is
described...and from Marco's note on the Yuan planting of shade trees, it seems that the Great
Kaan was as industrious as the modern People's Republic in lining the highways with
them...Marco notes the sharp contrast between the Central Asian influenced north and the
refractory south in choice of foods: in the south "they eat every kind of flesh, even that of dogs
and other unclean beasts, which nothing would induce a Christian to eat"...The importance of the
salt monopoly is stressed."<br>

<font color="#003366"><b>Shapes & sizes</b></font><br>
Pasta can be molded into almost any shape imaginable. The simplest, and perhaps earliest, form were long, flat sheets. 
Think: lasagne. Ravioli, vermicelli, ribbons and strings descend from this simple shape. As time progressed, pasta was molded
and extruded. Tubes happened. Think: rigatoni, elbow macaroni, & alphabet soup. By the early 20th century, most Americans 
regularly incorporated macaroni into family meals. Cookbooks do not generally address the depth and breadth of shape
choices. "Macaroni" is fuzzed over as one product. Presumably, urban centers offered more varieties than rural outposts. 
How many different shapes were available in this period? 
<p>
<b>[1911]</b><br>
"The average Amenrican consumer has no idea of the number of forms, a hundred or more, in which the paste is made by Italian manufacturers. 
They range form lasagnes, short, flat pieces from one to two inches wide, cut out, and sometimes molded, bu hand, to fidellini, long thin
threads, the finest of which are many times smaller than vermicelli, which is the smallest type generally know here--and, in between, a
great variety of forms and sizes--tubular, solid-round and flat, long and short, stars, dots, crescents, little animal shapes, 
etc., the last-named varieties being cut from thin sheets of the dough."<br>

"Macaroni is an Italian paste, but only one class of the endless variety of Italian pastes are of the true macaroni order, although a great many 
others are often called by that name. There is much confusion as to what is included under the name macaroni among us, and even in some parts 
of Italy the term is extended to cover several classes. Outside of Italy a great number of Italian pastes are being manufactured, especially in
 France, and more and more in America, although nowhere nearly as many as in Italy. These pastes are one of the greatest aids to economy, with
 great variety, of anything in the whole world of foods, and they are staples. They were perhaps invented as a substitute for meat during the long 
Lenten fast, and then afforded the best means for extending the flavor of a small amount of heat ever devised, while at the same time furnishing a 
great deal of nutriment. In the home of their origin they are described variously, but most accurately when it is said they are 'both substantial and
 delicate.'...Variety is gained by learning to use the different sorts which our own manufacturers call macaroni and label as 'shells,' 'large chort 
cut,' etc. We mostly have but one, and the right idea of what macaroni is--a long tube with a hole in it, usually rather large--but in our store we 
find 'ribbon macaroni,' which may be either long or short and as flat as a ribbon; 'large elbow macaroni,' 'small elbow macaroni,' quill,' 'sausage 
macaroni,' etc. These last four are tubular, but not of the Naples type. What we call macaroni is in some parts of Italy called 'long Naples 
macaroni'...where there are about two other divisions of these pastes, the noodles and those of a great number of shapes, like large and small, 
some like grains, or butterflies, or shells, or stars or letters of the alphabet, or feathers, or 'horse's teeth.' etc."<br>

<font color="#003366"><b>Elbow macaroni</b></font><br>
Elbow macaroni, as we Americans know it today, descends from 19th century Italian tubetti & ditali.
The earliest American print reference we find for "elbow macaroni" is 1900. Muellers (Pennsylvania) was an early
manufacturer. Creamettes, another popular brand, surfaced in 
1912. In sum: products with this name were manufactured in America. They were promoted for convenience (reduced cooking 
time) and economy (cheap).
Popular home economists supplied recipes in newspaper columns and cooking schools. 
<p>
"Tubetti...Factory-made tubes, usually small, both smooth and ridged. They are cooked in soupds or made with legumes. Also known as 
Tubettini, ditali, ditaletti (thimbles), gnocchetti di ziti, gnocchettini and coralli (corals). In Puglia and Sicily, denti de vechhia
(old woman's teeth), denti de cavallo (horse's teeth), ganghi di vecchia (old woman's legs) and magghietti....The name literally
means 'little tubes.' In Puglia, where pasta d'ingegno was widespread by the beginning of the 1800s, these irregularly shaped, small, 
curved tubes could be produced with a torchio or with the appropriate die."<br>

<font color="#003366"><b>Fettuccine Alfredo</b></font><br>
Although combinations of pasta, butter and cheese were enjoyed by ancient cooks, the invention
this particular dish is often attributed to Alfredo's
[restaurant] in Rome, 1914. Why? Alfredo Di Lelio, with a little help from Hollywood, made it
famous. Contemporary restaurants serve many versions of this dish. What
makes it super creamy? Some say it's the <a href="shortening.html#doublebutter">double butter</a>.
<p>
<b> Here's the generally accepted "creation" story:</b><br>
"Fettucini Alfredo....A dish of fettuccini egg noodles mixed with butter, Parmesean cheese, and
cream. The dish has been a staple of Italian-American restaurants since the mid-1960s. It was
created in 1914 by Alfred Di Lelio, who opened a restaurant in Rome, Italy, under his first name
on the Via della Scrofa in 1910. The dish supposedly helped restore the appetite of his wife after
she gave birth to their son. The original dish was made with a very rich triple butter Di Lelio made
himself, three kinds of four, and only the heart of the best parmigiano. Fettuccini all'Alfredo
became famous after Hollywood movie actors Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford ate the dish
at Alfredo's restaurant while on their honeymoon in 1927...After World War II Di Lelio moved to
the Piazza Augusto Imperatore, and in the 1950s his restaurant became a mecca for visiting
Americans, most of whom came to sample fettuccini Alfredo...Because most cooks could not
reproduce the richness of the original butter, today the dish almost always contains heavy
cream."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New
York] 1999 (p. 126)
<p>
"The story goes that while honeymooning in Rome in 1927, Douglas Fairbanks and Mary
Pickford dined almost daily on this rich pasta at Alfredo's restaurant, and in gratitude, presented
restauranteur Alfredo Di Lelio with a golden pasta fork and spoon at the end of their stay.
Journalists picked up the story and spread news of Fettuccine Alfredo across the Atlantic. Before
long, American chefs were improvising. According to Marie Simmons...food writer who is of
Italian heritage, an authentic Fettuccini Alfredo is not tricked out with cream or mushrooms or
green peas or garlic. It's a mix of sweet creamery butter, Parmigiano-Reggiano, homemade
fettuccini, and black pepper. Nothing more, nothing less."<br>

Anderson [Clarkson Potter:New York] 1997 (p. 213)
<p>
<b>Of course, most dishes are not created, they evolve:</b></br>
"Cheese is the earliest condiment for pasta of which we have documentation. Even before the
earliest recipes were written, cheese with pasta was the delight of the bon vivants of the Middle
Ages...Present in all the medieval collections of recipes that feature pasta, grated cheese was often
mixed with spices..."These tortelli must be yellow and strongly spiced, serve them in bowls with
plenty of pepper and grated cheese...Although it was abandoned by the elite beginning in the
seventeenth century, the mixture of cheese and spices continued in popular use. Pasta was served
with a carpet of well-aged grated cheese in taverns frequented by Pere Labat in the turn of the
eighteenth century."<br>

<p>
<b>A survey of recipes through time</b><br>
These recipes may not be called Fettuccine Alfredo, but they would certainly recreate something
close the original dish. The earliest recipe we have attributing Alfredo to this dish is dated <a href="foodfaq2.html#rectoralfredo">1928</a>, a year afther the famous
Fairbanks/Pickford encounter. The emphasis and success of this dish is on Alfredo, a culinary showman. Not the restorative properties created for an ailing wife. <br>

I saay French style because I found this recipe in a cookbook of that nation, but as often happens with printed recipes, which

300 grams (about 10-1/2 ounces) of Neapolitan-style long macaroni<br>
70 grams (about 2 1/3 ounces) of butter<br>
70 grams (about 2 1/3 ounces) of Gruyere cheese<br>
40 grms (about 1 1/3 ounces) of Parmesan cheese<br>
a small pot of broth<br>
Cook the macaroni until two-thirds done in moderately salted water. Put the broth oon the fire, bring it to a boil and then add the grated
Gruyere cheese and the butter, stirring well with a wooden spoon to help them dissolve. When this is done, immediately pour the broth over the
drained, partly cooked macaroni. I say immediately, because otherwise the Gruyere sinks to the bottom and sticks together. Keep the macaroni
on the fire until completely cooked, making sure that they do not absorb all the sauce. When you remove them from the stover,
season the macaroni with the Parmesan cheese. Serve with more Parmesan on the side for those who like strong tastes and prefer their pasta
sharp.  This, like macaroni Bolognese style, is a first course that comes in hand in family cookiing; you need only a small pot of 
broth from the day before, so you can save the time and expense of making a fresh meat broth. If you prefer the dish meatless, substitute
milk for the broth."<br>

That dish was named for Alfredo, who has a restaurant in Rome. When Alfredo mixes the butter and cheese through the noodles, it's a real ceremony. Alfredo always
mannages to be at each table when the waiter arrives with the platter of 'fettucine' so that he can do the mixig himself. As he mixes the noodles he sways from the
waist, keeping perfect time to the music of the orchestra. As he turns the noodles over and over, he puts lumps of butter under the stuff, and the the hot platter melts
this butter. First the butter comes to the top, then the Parmedan cheese, and pretty soon the whole mass is whirling around until it is a radiant, glorious mound of
'fettucine'. During the mixing, Alfredo actually leads the orchestra; they watch him closely, and harmonize with his movements. At the end of five minutes he stops back
to look at his masterpiece through half-closed eyes. Theyn, with a sweeping gesture, he invites the diner to partake. 'Fettucine' made Alfredo a cavaliere of Italy. I do 
no know whether the king knighted him with the flat or a sword or the round of a spoon. But he has the decoration, nevertheless, and he is envied by all the rival

golden spoon and the clammy-looking noodles changed to a dish of delicate thoughtfulness. When the king tasted it, he knighted Alfredo. The housewife can make it

Lasagne history is particularly interesting because it embraces not one, but three edible evolutions: <br>
1. Wide noodles made by Ancient Romans & Greeks <br>
2. Layered flat noodle & spice/cheese dishes in Medieval Europe <br>
3. Baked dish composed of flat noodles interlayered with cheese, meat & tomato sauce in modern Europe & contemporary USA


<p>
Food historians hypothesize lasagne [long flat strips of dried wheaten dough] were probably
the earliest forms of pasta. They were laid out to harden in the hot mediterranean sun and cut with
simple rollers designed expressly to create a curly, interlocking edge. Serving instructions for the
very first lasagnes were not much different from other than flat breads. Medieval and Renaissance lasagnes were
typically creamy, sweet, layered <a href="foodfaq2.html#macaroniandcheese">macaroni and cheese</a> type
dishes, often eaten during Christian Lent. They were flavored with cinnamon and pepper, not garlic and oregano. This is a far cry from the ground meat, <a href="http://foodtimeline.org/foodlpies.html#rcotta">ricotta</a>, <a
href="foodsauces.html#tomatosauce">tomato sauce</a>,
and <a href="foodfaq2.html#mozzarella">mozzarella</a> topped dish we Americans consider lasagne today. How things do change with
time!
<p>
"Lasagne: 
probably one of the earliest forms of pasta...consists of fairly flat sheets of pasta, typically
interleaved with a savoury mixture and baked in the oven...Some believe that its remote ancestor
was the classical Greek laganon; this was a flat cake, not pasta as we know it now, but capable of
developing in that direction. In classical Rome this was cut into strips and became known as
lagani (plural). Cicero (1st century AD) was known to have been particularly fond of lagani. So
was the Roman poet Horace, of the same century. He sited them as an example of simple
peasant's food while boasting of his simple way of life...something which could be called lasagne
in the modern sense had appeared in Italy by the 13th century...Since medieval times, lasagne have
been a popular feature in the range of pasta products. Recipes have changed over the centuries,
but the advantages of a pasta which comes in sheet form...have been a constant in the
kitchen."<br>

"The use of elongated pasta was also probalby introduced by the Arabs, and this is corroborated visually in the illustrations accompanying
the fourteenth-century <i>Tacuina sanitatis</i>...Among fourteenth-century recipe collections, only one, the Neapolitan
<i>Liber de coquina</i>, offers a step-by-step description of the preparation and serving of lasagne. Here <i>fermented</i> douth
(we do not know if this is an exception or the rule) is flattened into a thin sheet and cut into rectangles three inches
long. These are boiled in water and then seasoned, layer by layer, with grated cheeese (<i>caseum gratatum</i>) and, if desired, pulverized
spice. The recipe concludes with the stiupation that the dish should be eaten with a pointed wooden utensil (<i>uno punctorio ligneo</i>).
This detail suggests that the precocious use of the fork in Italy was prompted at least in part by the introduction of a dish as
difficult to handle as pasta, which is slippery and dangerously hot...Cheese--possibly enriched with spices--was the 
obligatory flavoring for pasta from the outset. This custom lasted at least until the eighteenth century. 'It must be known'--says the 
<i>Liber de coquina</i>--'that one should use a large quantity of cheese with both lasagne and corzetti.' The cheese could be sliced rather
than grated...It is clear, however, that grated cheese was the preferred choice, signifying from the start a successful union between
pasta and cheese, the foremost variety of which is Parmesan...All cookbooks confirm this, and not even the new and successful combination
of pasta with tomato sauce, which was first introduced around the end of the eighteenth century and fully established by the 
1820s, would really change things. Cheese and tomaptes, together or separately, are the most popular and most accessible flavorings for
pasta, in contrast to meat sauce and ragu, the prevailing choice for Parisian and Neapolitan cooking."<br>

"Though some authorities believe the word [lasagne] derives from Vulgar Latin lasania (cooking
pot), the ancient Romans made laganum, which referred to strips of dough baked on a flat
surface. Since lasagne requires a baking oven, which for most of Italian history was to be found
only in the kitchens of the wealthy families, the dish was considered to be a lavish one..."<br>

<blockquote>
<b>[14th century Italy]<br>
"Of lasagne.</b> To make lasagne take fermented dough and make into as thin as possible. Then divide it into squares of three
fingerbreadths per side. Then take salted boiling water and cook those lasagne in it. And when they are fully cooked,
add grated cheese. And, if you like, you can also add good powdered spices and powder them on them, when they are on the
trencher. Then put on a layer of lasagne and powder [spices] again, and on top another layer and powder, and continue until the trencher
 or bowl is full. Thet eat them by taking them up with a pointed wooden stick...This recipe is interesting from several points of
view--not because lasagne were an innovation of the fourteenth century, but because of the unusual method it sets out. Pasta was
common in medieval Italy...we find references ot maccaroni...in texts dating from before [Marco Polo's] lifetime. Lasagne, which are
cut from a sheet of pasta a formed with a rolling pin, are the likely successors of the laganae of Roman times, for which the late
fourth-century treatise of Apicius includes two recipes, although these yield quite different results, as one is boiled and the other
baked. The mixture of wheat flour and water known as pasta is also defined in part by its being cooked in moist heat; boiling water in the
West and steam or boiling liquid in China.
While lasagne are the culmination of a pasta-making tradition dating back to antiquity, the origin
of macaroni and vermicelli, first mentioned in medieval Italian cooking treatises, is far less
certain....the recipe we have selected is distinctive for its use of 'fermented' dough. There is no room for doubt that
leavening is used. In a prior reicpe fermento is added to a fritter dough precisely to make it 'grow'...Other Italian books contain reicpes for
lasagne made of flour and water and boiled in meat broth for meat days, or in almond milk for days of abstinence. In this recipe, our
lasagne are simply boiled in salted water. Another of the unusual elements that made us choose this particular version in the <i>liber
de coquina</i> is that it is the only one to explain clearly how lasagne are made--by rolling out the dough and cutting it into
squares three finger-breadths a side--and how they are eaten; with a pinted wooden stick. We can quite see the ned for a tool wit which to eat hot
lasagne without buring our fingers. But the fork was on the way!...It is only natural to wonder why these lasagne are made 
from a leavened dough, similar to bread dough, rather than from a simple mixture of flour and water. Remember that in Italy today lasagne, like
other fresh pastas, are made from flour and eggs. We have found...that a leavened dough, wen boiled, has a slight springiness that is 
lacking in an unleavened dough; this consistency comes close to the al dente texture of perfectly cooked pasta."<br>

<font color="#003366"><b>Macaroni & cheese</b></font><p>
Who invented macaroni & cheese? No one knows for sure, although the food historians generally
credit the ancient Greeks and Romans for coming up with the idea of combining these two foods.
The origin of pasta/noodles/macaroni is a matter of culinary controversy (Ancient
Rome? Etruscans? China? Korea?). According to the <i>Oxford Companion
to Food,</i> Alan Davidson, [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (page 159) "Cheese is one
of the oldest of made foods, dating back
to the prehistoric beginnings of herding. As with all fermented products, it seems likely that the
discovery of cheese was accidental..." 
<p>
We do know that medieval macaroni dishes (lasagnes & raviolis) were made with cheese and
sweetened with nuts and spices (<i>The Medieval Cookbook,</i> Maggie Black,  Lasagne with
cheese (pages 90-91). These would have tasted quite different from the mac and cheese we eat
today. Colonial American cookbooks contained recipes for macaroni and cheese in the English
tradition:
<p>
"Despite the many varieties, the most common name for pasta in later Medieval Italy seems to
have been  macaroni', although this now means the round as contrasted with the flat kind. The
fourteenth century English Forme of Cury gives a recipes for  macrows (an anglicized plural) that
unquestionably produces a flat result; the recipes even recommends serving it strewn with morsels
of butter, and with grated cheese on the side. In its native land it does not seem to have been
regarded as a very high-class food; in the sixteenth century
<p>
"Cheese is the earliest condiment for pasta of which we have documentation. Even before the
earliest recipes were written, cheese with pasta was the delight of the bon vivants of the Middle
Ages...Present in all the medieval collections of recipes that feature pasta, grated cheese was often
mixed with spices..."These tortelli must be yellow and strongly spiced, serve them in bowls with
plenty of pepper and grated cheese...Although it was abandoned by the elite beginning in the
seventeenth century, the mixture of cheese and spices continued in popular use. Pasta was served
with a carpet of well-aged grated cheese in taverns frequented by Pere Labat in the turn of the
eighteenth century."<br>

  Food historians generally agree modern primavera recipes, as we Americans
  know them today, originated in New York City during the late 1970s. Several
  articles in the New York Times confirm this was a period when several upscale
  chefs endeavored to redefine "Italian Cusine." Said cuisine drew on traditional
  "Old World" peasant recipes. They were typically composed of fresh vegetables
  and lighter sauces. Italian food historians confirm the phrase "primavera" in the
  gastonomic sense, simply means "springtime." In the Italy this term is applied to
  several dishes incorporating fresh young vegetables.
  <p>
  "Pasta primavera. Few people... would disagree that this is America's grandest
  contribution to the pasta repertoire. And as often happens with truly great recipes, it came
  about quite by chance. In the late 70s. Here's what Ella Elvin, former food editor of New
  York's Daily News, had to say about it in the February 1, 1978 paper:  Pasta Primavera is
  a specialty of Le Cirque at 58 E. 65th St. Sirio Macconi, co-owner, says it came onto his
  menu rather obliquely. He and friends had once had a few fun days of cooking wild boar
  and lobster in Canada, when his wife served pasta with briefly cooked fresh vegetables. 'It
  is something we do a lot in Italy," says Sirio, 'but on this occasion it tasted spectacularly
  good to everyone, and then we tried it as an item for friends here at the restaurant. When
  Paul Bocuse came, we suggested it as an appetizer and he said: 'I want it as the main
  course. ' It's a matter of using fresh vegetables that are in season'...The pasta is topped
  with spoonfuls of both vegetable sauces and pepper is ground over the top."<br>

  There is no questions that pasta primavera was invented in New York, at Le Cirque

  decided to add vegetables to his Alfredo sauce, or by Le Cirque cofoudner Jean Vergnes

  "No one denies that there has been a revolution in French food: it is less rich, with fresh
  ingredients put together in new and different ways. In the last five years heavy sauces
  have become light and classics such as canard a l'orange and beef Wellington have given
  way to rare duck breasts and medallions of beef with cranberries. Since New Yorkers
  probably eat as much Italian food as French, are they finding similar changes in Italian
  cooking?...Those [new] dishes...are typical of the meals in some of the stylish, sleeky
  appointed and usually expensive Italian restaurants that have become a fixture of New
  York. So different is the food form the Italian cooking so long familiar to most of us that
  there is talk of an Italian nouvelle cuisine...Whether there is such a thing is open to
  debate...There are some fad dishes...and certainly there is a trend toward lightness. But
  most of them feel that the foundation of the "new" dishes is as old as the Etruscan hills.
  "They take old peasant dishes and give them new names,"...The influence of New York's
  new Italian cooking extends beyond Italian restaurants. Fresh pasta or osso buco, risotto,
  or fetuccini with truffles often appear on the menus of Le Cirque, Odeon, the Four
  Seasons and the Palace. Onece a successful dish appears in one restaurant, it turns up on
  menus everywhere. Take pasta primavera. "James Beard called one day and said, 'Alfredo
  [Viazzi] , I'm afaid your past primavera is all over town!" ...[Viazzi] takes credit for
  introducing the dish to New York, although he says it is acutally peasant fare brought up
  to date. However, Siro Maccioni of Le Circ says that he invented his version seven years
  ago at a party when he ran out of other ingredients and had to make do with the spring
  vegetables that garnish the pasta. Perhaps all roads to lead to Rome. Italian chefs like to
  create dishes on the spur of the moment, and often cook special things for a favorite
  customer. This can be a mixed blessing."<br>

Pasta (in many different shapes and sizes) is an ancient food. It was enjoyed by many peoples in
many cultures. Stuffed pasta (ravioli, wonton, kreplach) is likewise a food shared by many
cultures and
cuisines. Food historians generally agree that stuffed pastas (and related recipes such as
lasagna) were probably introduced in Medieval times. Cookbooks confirm European and Middle
Eastern medieval pasta dishes could have been sweet (filled with cheese, honey, nuts, and
cinnamon) or savoury (filled with meat, pepper, and saffron). Asian wontons were typically
steamed or fried and were served with local vegetables.
     <a href="foodsauces.html#tomato">Tomato sauce</a> was not served with pasta
products in Medieval
times. Tomatoes are a "new
world" food and were introduced to Europe in the late 15th century by explorers. <a href="foodfaq2.html#aboutpasta">About pasta</a>.

"Ravioli: the archtypal stuffed pasta of the western world, can be presumed to be Italian in
origin but had started to appear as far away as England by the 14th century (when the Forme of
Cury gave a recipe for  rauioles), and was known in the south of France in medieval times. So
far as Italy is concerned, the earliest records of ravioli seem to be in some of the 140,000
preserved letters of Francesco di Marco, a merchant of Prato in the 14th century. They are
described as being stuffed with pounded pork, eggs, cheese, parsley, and sugar; while in Lent a
filling of herbs, cheese, and spices was used. There were both sweet and savoury kinds..."<br>

"The small, stuffed Italian shapes such as a ravioli and tortellini (both attested from the middle of

forms may have originated in the Near East and been transmitted in an arc from there, which
would certainly be consistent with the general historical pattern."<br>

"According to the sixteenth-century Italian historians, we owe pasta stuffed with chopped meat
or herbs, cheese or even fish to a peasant woman of Cernusco called Libista...The ravioli of the
fourteenth-century cookery books were usually deep-fried, like fritters...in its early days ravioli
generally meant a stuffing made of meat, cheese, eggs and herbs wrapped in dough, a dish like
modern canneloni...one of the oldest recipes of the kind [1481], for  tortelli' in the Assissi
manner'. These  tortelli' do not even use a dough wrapping for the stuffing; the instructions are
simply to roll the chopped meat mixture in flour. This coating of flour, having absorved the fat
from the chopped meat, would have coagulated slightly in the hot broth into which the tortelli
were put to be cooked...Raviolo were eaten at banquets too, and were clearly very popular in
Prato. They were not served alone, but as a garnish to a torta made of several layers of pastry
filled with chicken fried in oil, garlic sausage, ravioli stuffed wtih ham, almonds, and dates. Pastry
lid covered the whole torta, and it was cooked in the embers."<br>

Who invented spaghetti & meatballs? The answer to this question depends upon how strictly you
want to define these two foods. Both pasta and meatballs [ground meat mixed with cereal/spice
fillers, also known as sausage or forcemeat] date back to ancient times. They were foods that
evolved independently across many cultures and cuisines. Meat filled lasagne and ravioli were
quite popular in Medieval Europe, although they were not served with tomatoes at this time.
<a href="foodsauces.html#tomato">Tomato sauce</a> was introduced in the 18th century.
<p>
<b>About spaghetti</b><br>
Pasta, in many forms, has been around for thousands of years. In the beginning, ancients rolled
pasta by hand into long, flat shapes, similar to modern lasagne. Other shapes became
possible/popular as technology advanced. Vermicelli and other long noodles were made in ancient
days, though evidence from old cook books suggests they were thicker than the products we eat
today. Very thin spaghettis (including angel hair, capellini) were first introduced in the 19th
century because they required more sophisticated machines than the <a
href="http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/tri019.html">pasta presses</a> used in Thomas
Jefferson's day for production. Naples, Italy is generally acknowledged for its long tradition of
spaghetti making.
<p>
Food historians generally agree that the pasta we know today as spaghetti is a relatively new
invention, dating back to the early 19th century. Spaghetti served with meat in tomato sauce most
likely originated in Naples. Late 19th and early 20th century American cook books
often refer to recipes for spaghetti and meat sauce as Neapolitan spaghetti. The meats used in
these recipes are usually ham, sausage and bacon (traditional Italian fare). Recipes for spaghetti
and [ground beef] meatballs begin to show up in American cookbooks during World War II.<br>

<p>
"Spaghetti...commonly said to account for more than two-thirds of the whole annual consumption
of pasta, is certainly its most popular form...but by no means the oldest. Indeed, until the
introduction of extrusion presses, and especially of the powerful machines which were introduced
in the latter part of the 19th century...its production was a laborious business. Macaroni, tubular
and hollow, was easier to make without modern machinery, and its name was sometimes used in a
generic way for pasta...The names of the Italian spaghetti dishes which are now known worldwide
are of relatively recent birth. It might be thought that spaghetti and tomato sauce, perhaps the
simplest combination, would go a long way back. However, the first documented tomato sauce
for pasta appears in Ippolito Cavalcanti's <i>Cucina teorico pratica</i> of 1839..."<br>

<b>Commercial production</b><br>
Food historians tell us that the technology for mass-producing pasta and canned tomato products
existed in the middle of the 19th century. Primary evidence (cookbooks, food advertisements)
confirms spaghetti was prepared and consumed by the American public in the late 1800s and early
20th century. "Global penetration" of many Italian food products occured at this time because
that's when people from this country immigrated in large numbers to other parts of the world,
most notably  America. This explains why many of our American pasta/tomato sauce companies
were founded in the beginning decades of the 20th century.  <a

<b>Spaghetti Carbonara</b><br>
Our survey of mid-20th century Italian-American cookbooks identifies several recipes approximating Spaghetti (linguine,
noodles, pasta) "alla Carbonara." The closest modern recipe in this creamy-cheesy-egg yolk genre is 
<a href="foodfaq2.html#alfredo">Fettuccini
Alfredo</a>, a USA celebrity endorsed favorite from the 1920s.  The primary difference between Alfredo and Carbonara is the latter
features bacon or related cured pork product. Curiously (by today's standards), early recipes do not address the origin of the 
name. We wonder: was that because everyone back then "knew" what the name meant? Presumably, the appelation "carbonara"
was selected for a reason. 
<p>
<b>What's in a name?</b><br>
"Carbonara, alla. "Charcoal style." A Roman pasta preparation usually made with spaghtetti
sauce with cream, pancetta, pecorino, and parmigiano onto which a raw egg is dropped and
cooked by the heat of the pasta itself. It is then tossed and served with plenty of black pepper.
The origin of the name has never been established. Some believe it refers to black spaghetti made
with squid ink by Roman cooks in the seafood market, others to a 19th -century radical group
called  I Carbonari. Still others believe it was a dish created by the coal miners on the mountains
betwen Abruzzo and Lazio. Of the name may simply describe the look of the cooked bits of
pancetta in the preparation."
---The Dictionary of Italian Food and Drink, John Mariani [Broadway Books:New York] 1998
(p. 61)
<p>
"A short while ago an acquaintance told us an amusing story about the origins of spaghetti carbonara, which means
spaghetti charcoal-burner-style. It had to do with an American soldier aksing for an egg noodle dish in Italy during World
War II. The waiter did not wholly comprehend his request and had the chef prepare him a noodle dish with raw eggs. It still left the
origin of the name corbonara unexplained. Now a letter from a reader in Manhattan to contradict the egg noodle history plus
an explanation of the name: 'The legend I grew up on was that the dish was created by Garibaldi's troops during the war for 
Italy's unification in the 1850s, the Risorgimento. Lacking the pther means for cooking, the soldiers prepared their spaghetti
over a charcoal fire, hence the name carbonara. Nicholas SA. Osgan of New YOrk has proposed an interesting association of
recipe names: 'I don't know why spaghetti carbobara is called carbonara either. Except that, all carbonara dishes, carbonade doe
boeuf Flamand, cargbonade de boeuf Provencal, have one common ingredient--a lot of sauteed onions,w hich is the one theing you left
out of your spaghetti recipe.' The relation --if any--of carbonara to carbonnades (or carbonades) is something to ponder at a 
later date. On the other hand, I have never encountered a dish for spaghetti carbonara nor a recipe for it that included onions 
in large or small amounts. Carbonnades a la flamande, of course, to require almost a smuch weight in onions a s in meat. Carbonnades
in the style of Nimes (France) is a stew made with lamb or mutton, and onions, in small quantity, are among the ingredients. They
are not predominant, however. A Manhattan reader offers her great-trandmother's theory on the name's origin plus her great-grandmother's
recipe: She writes, 'According to my great-grandmother, who is 92 years young and an authority on most things Italian, linguine
alla carbonara refers to both a secret society that at one time tried to overthrow the Italian government and to men who work with 
coal."<br>

Baldridge passed on to John. It was during her three years as secretary to Clare Booth Luce, former United States ambassador to Italy,

<a name="peaches">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Peaches</a></b> </font><br>
<b>Origin & diffusion</b><br>
"Wild peach trees still grow in China, the original home of the peach...Well before the 10th century BC (some
suggest much earlier) improved varieties were being cultivated. Peaches are easily raised from seed, and cultivation
spread westwards through areas with suitable climate, such as Kashmir, to Persia. It flourished there so well that it
came to be regarded as a native Persian fruit...In classical antiquity Theophrastus (c. 370-c. 288 BC) was the first
writer to mention the peach. Despite the clear lack of evidence, it is widely assumed that it was Alexander the Great
who brought it to Greece from Persia. Pliny (1st century AD) mentioned half a dozen types, e.g. the peaches of Gaul
(France) and the Asiatic ones, and declared the fruit to be particularly wholesome. Generally, it seems to have been
the Romans who spread the peach further north and west. Much later, in the 16th century, it was the Spaniards who
took it to America. The 16th century used also to be thought of as the the time when the peach reached England.
However...there is much evidence, including the supply of two peach trees in the Tower of London in 1275 and a
reference by Chaucer (1372), to show that it was being grown there much earlier...But it seems that peach-growing
was discontinued for a time, and that it was in the 16th century that the fruit was reintroduced from France and the
Netherlands."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 588)
<p>
"The peach was the object of a sort of cult in China, where for poets, sculptors and painters it was a symbol of
immortality, despite the fact that it grows on a short-lived tree...Friends gave each other peaches, real or in
porcelain, to attest to their affection. The veneration accorded the peach no doubt arose from its ancient and
peculiary Chinese character, for it is believed to have originated in China, where it is called tao. Chinese writings
contain references to the peach dating form 2000 B.C. (Dubious) and from the fifth century B.C. (trustworthy),
including some from the works of Confucious, at least three centuries before we hear of this fruit from anywhere
else. Peach trees are found growing wild in China, and I think nowhere else...Chinese world-peach trees are apt to be
gnarled and squat, their fruit is small and the pit large, but the flesh is exquisite in flavor. Chinese peach trees breed
from seed, which is not the case for peach trees anywhere else in the world, justifying the belief that all peaches
except those of China are hybrids, and therefore probably alien to the areas in which they are found. It was long
thought that the peach originated in Persia (where it does not grow wild), and indeed its scientific name is Prunus
persica, because it was from Persia that the ancient Romans imported the fruit, and from the Romans that we first
hear about it. They could not have known that Persia had acquired it, across a good deal of intervening territory,
from China, a country whose existence they did not suspect...The Romans could not have known about the peach at
the beginning of the second century B.C., for if they had, Cato would certainly have mentioned it; and though the
Asian Army brought back many new foods from the East when it returned to Italy in 185 B.C. it is doubtful that the
peach was among them. Pliny wrote about it in the first century A.D., called it the Persian apple...and said that the
Romans had imported it from Persia for the first time only shortly before--apparently by a very indirect route, for he
added that the trees were first planted in Egypt (where we never hear of them again) and then on the island of
Rhodes, but bore not fruit in either place...The peach seems never to have achieved a foothold in ancient Grecce,
but in Rome several varieties were developed...The peach was not common in Rome either, for Pliny says it was
hard to grown in Italy, so the Romans imported it from Persia, which made it expensive."<br>

<b>China</b><br>
"Domestication of the peach (t'ao) is usually placed in temperate China, with most authorities favoring northern
and/or western China, especially its hill and mountain regions, including Tibet...The ancient Chinese looked to the
west as the home of the peach, and specifically the K'un-lun Shan, those ranges of Central Asia...Whatever the
exact time and place of its domestication, the peach has been known in China since great antiquity, wieth remains
found in archeological sites in Chekaing that may date as early as the fourth or fifth millennium B.C....Today the
peach is a typical crop of northern China...The peach tree has been surrounded with greater mysticism in China than
any other plant, cherished for its delicious fruit and beautiful flowers, important in symbolism and ritual, and
frequently mentioned in literature and depicted in art...Because of this...the peach deserves first place in any list of
classical Chinese fruits. The traditional Chinese viewed the peach as symbolic of long life and immortality, and
various dieties and illustrious persons of the past are depicted as carrying the shou-t'ao, "peach of
immortality."...The Chinese also considered peach wood...protective against evil spirits, who held the peach in awe.
In ancient China, peach-wood bows were used to shoot arrows in every direction in an effort to dispel evil...In
modern China, little mysticism is associated with the peach, but on New Year's Eve people sometimes suspended a
peach spray over their gates, and used peach brances to sprinkle water on the ground around the house as protection
against evil spirits."<br>

"Peach. Prunus persica developed from the same ancestral materials as the cherry, plum, apricot and almond; the
diversions occurred somewhere in eastern China, wherre the peach was developed. Xuan Zang pointed out the

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Pepper</a></b></font><br>

Black (and white) pepper comes from the dried, unripe fruit of the Piper nigrum plant. It is a
tropical plant, native to the East Indies. In ancient times, pepper was prized both as a medicine
and food flavoring. Symbolically,
pepper was a sign of wealth; practically, pepper was offered as payment and gifts. In
early times, to receive a gift of pepper was a great honor. Pepper is also connected with
some traditional Christmas foods dating back to Medieval times. Why? Cooks through
time saved their most precious commodities for the holidays. Northern European
pepperkor and peppernut cookies are of this tradition. Gingerbread and lebkuchen were
also made with pepper in these early days.

<p>
<b>Black, white, green & pink pepper</b>
<p>
"Peppercorns come in three colours. Unripe, they are 'green'--and green peppercorns began to enjoy considerable popularity
from the early 1970s, for the combination of heat, aroma, and soft crunchiness that they brought to sauces, terrines, etc. Picked
slightly underripe, dried, and sold without their husks removed, they are 'black'. And fully ripe and dehusked they are 'white'. None of these,
incidentally, should be confused with the so-called 'pink peppercorn', for which there was a brief fashion in the early
1980s; this superficially resembles the true peppercorn, but is in fact related to poison ivy."<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 250)
<p>
"Peppercorn--piper nigrum is a vine--native to the East Indies...The Greeks and Romans accepted peppercorns as a tribute, and the
spice was certainly the basis for much of the "lure of the east" that impelled first the Portuguese and then other 
European explorers around Africa toard the fabled Spice Islands."<br>

[According to this source, pepper originated in prehistoric India.]
<p>
"Pepper became known in classical Greece around 400 BC; it is first mentioned by the comic playwrights Antiphanes,
Eubulus and Alexis and in a Hippocratic text. Dilphius of Siphnos, recommending pepper with scallops in the early third
century BC, provdes the oldest positive evidence of the use of pepper as a condiment...Pepper was the quintessential spice of the
Indian Ocean trade in Roman times. It was for pepper, more than any other single product, that Roman gold and silver coins were
exported to India; pepper, when it reached Rome, was stockpiled as another kind of currency in the treasury an in the horrea
piperatoria 'pepper warehouses' built by Domitian. But it was for use as well as for storing. For those who could afford this
costly exotic, pepper is called for no fewer than 452 times in the recipes of Apicus."<br>
---<i>Fodo in the Ancietn World From A to Z</i>, Andrew Dalby [Routledge:London] 2003 (p. 254-255)
<p>
"As several Sanskrit texts show, the use of pepper by the peoples of India goes farther back than
that of any other spice. The various forms of its name in the European languages, apart from
Spanish...are from an Aryan vocable, pippeli, originating in the valley of the Ganges. The
Aryans were the first exporters of wild pepper from the tropical forests of the Indian
subcontinent.  Unlike cinnamon and indeed all other spices, pepper was used in foods in Europe
as soon as it was introduced, around the sixth or fifth century BC, although Hippocrates, the first
European writer to describe it, mentions it as a medicament rather than a culinary
ingredient...Like all spices, pepper was credited with health-giving properties,especially as a
digestive, an aperient, to induce sneezing, and-most important of all-as an aphrodesiac. Its rapid
rise to favour is unprecedented among spices. Pliny expresses his surprise at the fact six centuries
later in Book XII of his Natural History; its  only pleasing quality is its  'pungency', it is  bought
by weight like gold or silver'...The pepper the Romans like so much was  'long pepper', whereas
we now use round pepper, which became popular in the twelfth century and had replaced long
pepper by the fourteenth..."<br>
---<i>History of Food</I>, Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat [Barnes & Noble:New York] 1992  (p.491)

<p>
"Pepper, more than any other spice, being stronger and more abundant than the others, came to
be seen as a symbol of power and virility, quantities reflected in its powerful and aggressive
flavour. The symbolic factor rated high, since in huge amounts, which could hardly all have been
consumed, would have been bound to go stale. In the same way, pepper, described as a  useful'
rent or due, was included among the sources presented to overlords in the Middle Ages, but it was
generally specified separately, as a true determinant of workd of the act of vassalage. A French
proverb says that something is "cher comme poiver," expensive as pepper. Pepper was often
mentioned in dowries and as part of ransoms and fines. These symbolical meanings meet in the
pepper in the Christmas  'tax' imposed by Archbishops Bertrand and Rostaing de Noves."<br>
---<i>ibid</i> (p. 493)

<p>
"There are numerous references to pepper by classical authors. Pliny (1st Century AD) describes
black pepper minutely, complaining about the price and noting that white pepper cost almost
twice as much as black. Pepper was a precious and expensive substance for the Romans...By the
Middle Ages, pepper had assumed great importance in Europe where it was used by the rich as a
seasoning, and also a preservative...The earliest reference to the pepper trade in England is in the
statutes of Ethelred (978-1016) where it was enacted that  Esterlings' bringing their ships to
Billingsgate should pay a toll at Christmas and at Easter plus 10lb of pepper. The first mention of
the Guild of Pepperers, one of the oldest guilds in the City of London, is from 1180...Pepper has
been one of the most important commodities of the spice trade. In Antwerp in the mid-16th
century...the price of pepper served as a barometer for European business in general..."<br>

<b>About pepper mills</b><br>
"Pepper mill...In the 1880s Americans, used to using pepper shakers at the table, seemed to find
the French use of pepper mills a novel good idea, for flavor and to avoid adulterated packaged
ground pepper. This was about 1880. Many styles of carved or turned hardwood mills were
offered in the 1920s...Pepper mill, brass (sometimes copper & brass) cylinder with domed top,
longish, slightly bent crank handle in top, very common form. Actually started out sometime in
the early 19th C. As a coffee mill, from Persia/Turkey. Usually has decorative bands around part
of body...At some point in the 20th C., people either started using them as pepper mills, or
making similar ones for that use."<br>

<p>
<b>Ground pepper in America:</b><br>
"Pepper was available in the United States in the colonial period, but it was only after the American Revolution that the United
States became a player in the global pepper trade. This trade began in 1793 when Jonathan Carnes, a Salem, Massachusetts,
sea captain, set sail for the East Indies. He was successful in finding pepper, but on his way home his ship was wrecked off
Bermuda. He sailed to the Indies in 1795 on a new ship...and returned with his hold full of peppercorns--which he sold at a 
700 percent profit. Others followed and Salem became the pepper port of note in the new United States...In the early nineteenth century some regarded pepper as a cause of insanity. Pepper in any case was shunned by 
food purists, who thought that the spice should be avoided or, at least, used in moderation. By the past-Civil War
period, pepper was considered more acceptable, but it was still to be avoided by children or by those who already had a 
"sound digestion" and did not need condiments."<br>

<b>About fresh ground pepper served in American restaurants</b><br>
Our survey of newspapers and magazines indicates the practice of offering freshly ground pepper (at table) to restaurant patrons
began sometime in late 1980s. It climaxed in the mid-1990s. By the late '90s, it was *old.* We're not finding any particular chef/restaurant/culture/cuisine credited for this
innovation. Indeed, print sources confirm offerings are all over the map...from upscale European restaurants to chain eateries catering
to trendy youthful crowds. 
<p>

"Black, white and green peppercorns are readily available in the United States and are best purchased as whole peppercorns. Unfortunately, the most common way pepper is sold in this country is in the ground state. Whole peppercorns will stay fresh for a long time, but ground pepper quickly loses both its aroma and its flavor. Bottled ground white pepper can even start to taste rancid.
Using fresh ground pepper is not just a fad started by smart restaurateurs who wanted to improve their salad presentations. Freshly ground pepper can mean the
 difference between an ordinary dish and an extraordinary one. When a recipe calls for freshly ground pepper, it means pepper ground from a mill by the cook as
 it is needed. And one of the easiest ways to improve your cooking is to buy whole peppercorns and a pepper mill."<br>
---"Pepper Puts Dishes on More Flavorful Ground," JeanMarie Brownson, <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, Feb 22, 1987 (p. 18)
<p>
"If fresh-gound pepper and grated cheese are offered at one table, we will be sure they are offered to all."<br>
---"Today's Special: Advice for Restauranteurs," Patricia Brooks, <i>New York Times</i>, January 2, 1994 (p. CN12)
<p>

"'Fresh ground pepper' I liked it better when there was just a simple pepper shaker on a table. Then someone came up with the idea of 
'fresh ground pepper,' for which there seems to be only one pepper grinder in the entire restaurant. The waiter asks if we would like some as though we are 
being tempted with saffron or beluga caviar. Once the waiter starts grinding, I've been tempted not to tell him when to stop, just to see how far he would go. 
Give us either a pepper grinder for each table or give us back the shaker. Incidentally, a bit of semantics: What the waiters are really offering us is 'pepper that is 
freshly ground,' although we are not sure how fresh the pepper is that is being ground. It just doesn't seem worth the trouble."<br>

Food historians tell us <a href="foodfaq2.html#pickles">pickles</a> (fruits and vegetables preserved in brine
with spices) originated in India. Both limes and lemons were pickled whole. Culinary evidence
confirms pickled limes (and lemons) were made by British cooks in the 18th century. These
recipes were introduced to North America by English settlers. Early American cookbooks contain
many recipes for pickles. Curiously? Very few contain recipes for pickled limes. 
<p>
 Louisa May Alcott's <i>Little Women</i> suggests pickled limes were fashionable New England
treats in
the middle of the 19th century. Amy, the youngest March daughter, was quite fond of these. She
did not make her own limes, but purchased them from a merchant. In
one scene of the book Amy is caught eating these by her teacher. The teacher humiliates Amy by
forcing her to
throw her beloved limes out of the window, two by two. Passage from <i>Little Women</i>: <a

<b>Limes</b><br>
"Lime. An important citrus fruit which seems to have originated in the region of Malaysia. While
lemons are the major
acid citrus fruits in the subtropics, limes are the most prominent in the tropical regions...It is hard
to judge when the lime
was first taken into cultivation, since the oldest surviving documents do not distinguish it from the
other citrus fruits. An
Indian medical work of C. AD 100 refers to both lemon and lime as jambira. The later Arabic and
Persian word, laimun
and limun seem also to have been used for both; and most modern names for either come from
this root. The lime seems
not to have been known in classicat times. Although the westard path of the lime in early medieval
times is hard to trace,
it seems safe to assume that it was carried to Europe by the Arabs; that it was cultivated to some
extent in Italy and
Spain; and that, because it is better suited by a hotter climate, such is that, soon after the
discovery of the New World by
Europeans, the lime as introduced there along with other citrus fruits, and that limes quickly
became abundant in the W.
Indies and C. America, especially Mexico."<br>

<p>
 "Like most of the other members of the citrus family, the lime (Citrus aurantiifolia) is
 native to Southeast Asia. It was first cultivated in China and India, then introduced in
 southern Europe (probably during the Crusades), and carried much later by the
 Spaniards to the West Indies. The original lime--small, round, and quite tart--is today
 called the "Mexican," "West Indian," or "Key" lime, with its juice deemed essential to
 Key lime pies. ..The lime and lemon industry of Florida (which provides close to 90
 percent of the limes grown in North America) got its start in the 1880s, declined after
 freezes in the 1890s, and revived after World War I. Limes are very high in vitamin C
 and figured prominently in warding off scurvy, the dread disease of seamen from the
 sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries. In the eighteenth century, the British navy
 issued lime juice to all seamen to keep the disease at bay--hence the nickname "limeys."

Food historians tell us <a href="foodfaq2.html#pickles">pickles</a>, foods preserved in brine or vinegar, have been known since
ancient times. Many foods are treated this way, including vegetables (cucumbers, cauliflowers,

Recipes for pickles are found in 17th and 18th century American and British cookbooks. Recipes
for pickled peppers began appearing in the 19th century. As one might expect, there were several recipes. The level of 
"heat" was controlled by the number of seeds left in the pickle. Sample recipes here:
<blockquote>
<b>[1824]<br>
"To Pickle Pepper.</b><br>
Gather the large bell pepper when quite young, leave the seeds in and the stem on, cut a slit in
one side, between the large veins, to let the water in; pour boiling salt and water on, changing it
every day or three weeks--you must keep them closely stopped; if, at the end of this time, they be
a good green, put them in pots and cover them with cold vinegar and a little tumeric; those that
are not sufficently green, must be continued under the same process till they are so. Be careful
not to cut through the large veins, as the heat will instantly diffused itself through the pod."<br>

hours; if they have not a good green color, they will get it by a scalding in the brine; drain them, and if you wish them very
hot, pack them away whole in cold vinegar; if you wish them very mild, remove their seeds--scraping them out through a slit
cut in the side of each pepper, and pack them in vinegar. They ought to be good pickles in eight weeks. You may, also, fill
the pepper with red cabbage cut finely; they pour boiling vinegar over them,--when cool, pack them in jars, and they will

Take fine full-grown bell-peppers. Make a brine in a stone jar of salt and water, strong enough to float an egg; and let the 
peppers remian in it two days, putting a weight on the cover to keep it down. Then take them out, wash them well in cold water, 
drain them, and wipe them dry. Cut a slit in the side of each, and extract all the seeds, as if left in, they will be entirely
too hot. Through these slits let all the water run out. Put them into a clean stone jar. Boil sufficient of the best cider
vinegar, interspersed with the muslin bags of broken-up cinnamon, mace, and nutmeg. Pour it, boiling hot, on the peppers in the
jar. Distribute the bags of spice among the peppers, and cork the jar warm. You may stuff the peppers in the manner of mangoes,
with pickled red cabbage finely shred, minced onions and minced uccumbers pickled, and seasoned with a little mustard seed, ginger,
and mace. Tie up the slit with pack-thread, crossing all round. Fill upt the jars with vinegar, putting sweeet oil on the top.
Your mary green bell-peppers in the usual way, with vine leaves or cabbage leaves. All pickles should be kept in a dry place. If
you find them mouldy they are not always spoiled. Take them out of the jar, wipe off all the mould carefully, and throw away
the vinegar. Wash the jar very clean, scald it, and set it in the sun to purify still more. Make a new pickle with fresh
seasoning, and put them into that."<br>

<b>What is a pickle?</b><br>
This simple question does not have a simple answer. It all depends upon how you define the word
"pickle." Food historians trace the process of pickling (preserving foods in salt/brine or vinegar) 
back to Ancient Egypt. These peoples were known to have pickled fish and melons. If you mean
the pickling of cucumbers (what we Americans usually call pickles today) that practice perhaps dates back to
India,  about 3,000 years ago. Some food historians say William Beukelz, a Dutch fisherman
invented pickled foods in the 15th century. <a href="foodfaq2.html#dillpickles">Dill pickles</a> were introduced by
German immigrants. <a href="foodfaq2.html#sweetpickles">Sweet pickles</a> come from Central and northern Europe. 
<a href="foodfaq2.html#breadandbutter">Bread & butter pickles</a> are an early 20th century development. 
Today we have <a href="foodfaq2.html#koolaidpickles">Kool-Aid pickles</a>. 
In addition to traditional cucumbers, a variety 
edibles may be pickled. Think: <a href="foodfaq2.html#pickledlimes">Pickled limes</a>, <a href="foodfaq2.html#pickledpeaches">pickled peaches</a>, 
<a href="foodeggs.html#pickledeggs">pickled eggs</a>,

<b>When did humans begin pickling food & why?</b><br>
"We know from Herodotus that in the fifth century B.C. the Babylonians and Egyptians pickled
fish such as sturgeon, salmon, and catfish, as well as poultry and geese. (p. 76)...Salt's
dehydrating properties could...be applied to almost any food...In the hot southern regions of the
Mediterranean, the Middle East and North Africa, fresh vine leaves were parboiled and preserved
in jars of brine to make stuffed vine-leaf dishes such as dolma...(p. 93)...Although the word
"pickle" is used in many different preserving methods, preserving foods in container filled with
vinegar is always known as "pickling." <br>

95)
<p>
"The use of vinegar as a preservative of edibles is very ancient in China and was still common in T'ang times. Vinegar was 
concocted from a variety of substances, among them rice, wheat, peaches, and grape juice...Sometimes it flavor was enhanced by
the addition of such substances as the acidic leaves of the kumquat of south China...This was combined with brine to make the
preservative...It was used in T'ang and Sung times for preserving duck eggs, which it turned dark in color. But the most characteristic and
traditional Chinese methods of preserving both vegetables and meats involved pickling by such processes as fermentation, hydrolysis, and
induced decomposition...A very typical species of pickle was called chiang, which has been aptly translated 'bean-pickle.'
...Pickled vegetables, fermented by microorganisms that thrive on the lactic acid in plant juices, were called tsu...Varieties
appear to have been diverse and numerous...The word hai was used in T'angtimes for a very important class of pickled products, which I shall
call meat-pickle...The Hsin T'ang shu...gives prominence to deer meat-pickle, rabbit meat-pickle, goat (or sheep) meat-pickle,
and fish meat-pickle in the court cuisine."<br>

"A Kannada work of AD 1594, the Lingapurana of Gurulinga Desika, describes no less than fifty
kinds of pickles. By far the most important material for pickling is raw mangoes (whole baby fruit,
wild mangoes, cut slices, or the hard fibrous avakkai). Others are limes, lemons, small onions,
brinjals, chillies, karaunda berries, pork wild boar, prawns and fish...In current practice, it is
customary to make use of the fire to make a pickle. Thus mustard seeds may first be fried in the
oil of choice; then the mango or lime pieces dressed with tumeric and salt are put in and fried till
tender, after which powdered spices (chillies, methi seeds, asafoetida) are added, and the mass
mixed thoroughly and put by to mature. There are of course numerous variations."<br>

<b>Besides cucumbers, what can be pickled?</b><br>
Historic English and USA cookbooks provide extensive instructions for pickling a wide variety of edibles.
Fruits, vegetables, flowers, nuts, meats, fish and shellfish could all be pickled, thus extending their "shelf life." Most cookbooks
offer a section specifically titled "Pickles." Catsups and mixed compositions (chow-chow) are sometimes also included. Instructions for pickling 
meats (ham, bacon, pork) and fish are generally included with the meat recipes, not in the pickle chapter. 
By World War II, the word "pickle" by itself generally implies cucumbers. FoodTimeline library owns the books listed below.

<b>Sweet pickles</b><br>
"The noun "pickle" applies to that which pickles as well as to that which gets pickled; hence, a
sweet pickle is both a fruit or vegetable that has been preserved in a sugary solution and the
sugary solution in which the fruit or vegetable has been preserved...In the United States, pickles
are primarily the products of central European tradition...American Indians themselves produced a
maple-sap vinegar to preserve game in preparation for the winter. Still, the story of American
pikcles does not really take shape until the searly eighteenth century, with the arrival of the
Pennsylvania Dutch...Pennsylvania Dutch cookery fairly rests on the notion of the seven sweets
and seven sours thought requisite for any feast; sweet pickles made from small cucumbers,
particulalry gerkins, are just one of many options--but the one Americans have collectively chose
to adopt and to adapt...There are...numerous variations on the sweet pickle theme...Pickled fruits
(including strawberries, grapes, and even watermelon rinds) may be less relevant in the
twenty-first century than they were in the nineteenth when home canning and preserving was the
norm."<br>

<b>About dill</b><br>
"Dill. This herb (Anethum graveolens), a member of the parsley family and more aromatic than fennel 
(a relative), has been pronounced native to central Asia and to southeastern Europe. The name, 
however, comes from the Norse word dilla, meaning "lull," apparently because the seeds were believed to 
be good for insomnia. Confusion over the plant's origin is probably inevitable because it grows wild in 
most temperate regions. The ancient Greeks used dill as a remedy for hiccups as well as for culinary 
purposes, and it has been a part of Mediterranean cuisines ever since. The Romans credited the plant with 
fortifying qualities and made certain that gladiators were well fortified with it. As their empire receded, dill 
remained behind to become seminaturalized in much of northern Europe, although it has to be cultivated 
in the Scandinavian countries. Today, both dill seed and dill weed are used as seasonings. The aromatic 
seed heads flavor pickles...sauces, and other foods such as fish, cheeses, and yoghurt. The feathery 
green leaves (dill weed) have a wonderful aroma when fresh and taste milder than the seeds. The fresh 
leaves go well in potato and tuna salads. Dried, the leaves lose all their aroma and most of their taste." <br>
---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kenneth F. Kiple & Kriemhild Conee Ornelas, Volume 
Two [Cambridge University Press:Cambridge] 2000 (p. 1768-9) 
<p>
"Dill is the quintessential northern European herb; its feathery green fronds dot the grey fishmarkets of Sweden, Finland, 
etc., bearing witness to its symbiosis with fish in Scandinavian cookery. Its name is appropriately Germanic, too: it comes from 
a hypothetical West Germanic word *diljo, and is found throughout the Germanic languages...It found its way early to North 
America, and has established a particular niches there as the key ingredient of dill pickles." <br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 110) 
<p>
"Dill, culinary herb native to the eastern Mediterranean. Texts suggest its use in wreaths and other ritual and sensual contexts 
more frequently than its incorporation in cooked dishes; the recipes of Apicius, however, call for dill about forty times. it is usually the 
fresh leaf that is meant, though the seed was also used in cooking. Dill seed is found by archaeobotanists in Roman contexts indicating 
food use...As an element in the diet dill was regarded as a diuretic and very 'hot'. Dioscorides gives instructions for the 
making of dill oil, to be used as an ointment." <br>

<b>Bread & Butter pickles</b><br>
We're finding not one, but two possible explanations for the name "bread and butter pickles." The first relates to the practical
allusion to "bread and butter" in the sense of paying one's bills. The second suggests the name deployed from Victorian practice
of combining bread and butter sandwiches with pickles. Neither explanation (to us, anyway) appears sufficient. 
<p>
<b>The naming theories:</b><br>
<b>(1)</b> "Q. This year my garden yielded more than 350 pounds of cucumbers, so I spent many days producing pickles, mostly bread-and- butter pickles. What is the origin of that name?
<p>
A.I have been told that the term came about because some home chef made a preparation of sliced cucumbers with vinegar, turmeric, mustard seeds, sliced onion and sugar and sold the bottled pickle slices at a roadside stand. 

The income they produced was pronounced 'bread and butter' - the earnings for the summer. In the dictionaries 
bread-and-butter means staple as opposed to fancy and basic or commonplace; the term has a long history in the meaning 
'taken as a type of everyday food.'"<br>

<b>Kool Aid pickles?</b><br>
Pickles can be curious things. On the most basic level, almost any fruit or vegetable can be *pickled*.  The primary purpose of the pickling process is preservation. This accounts for the standard brine, vinegar and sugar concoctions. Color alteration is nothing new. Eggs pickled with a splash of beet juice produce quite the colorful result. Kool-aid pickles appear to be a brand new twist on a very old theme. Notes here:
<p>
"It's the yin and yang of the condiment world. A blending of color and flavor that almost defies description. Almost. It is called the Kool-Aid
Pickle and, really, that describes it perfectly. I know the look on your face right now (it's not pretty, by the way), because I saw it on my wife when I announced that I was going to make up a batch of Kool-Aid Pickles. The fact that she had no idea what a Kool-Aid Pickle was in no way diminished her reaction. 
"I don't even like pickles. I'm not trying it; it sounds horrible," she said.  "You like sweet and sour pork," I replied in something of a non sequitur. "OK, I'll try it. But only one bite."... The first time I ever heard of a Kool-Aid Pickle was in a Page Three article in this newspaper a few weeks ago. It was relaying a story that
ran in the New York Times and was picked up by media outlets around the world. The recipe apparently has its origins in the region around the Mississippi
Delta but, thanks to the New York Times and the Internet, it is spreading to other parts of the country (and the world), including my house. It may be giving it more credit than it deserves to call it a recipe. To create a Kool-Aid Pickle, you simply marinate dill pickles in your favorite flavor of Kool-Aid &#8212; Tropical Punch seems to be the preferred variety. The recipe I followed said I should pour out the brine from a jar of dill pickles, replace it with the Kool-Aid, then let it soak
for a few days. Judging by what I saw on the Internet, other people totally submerge the pickles in what appears to be a bucket of the drink mix."<br>

<b>Here is the original <i>New York Times</i></b> article:<br>

"A gallon jar of pickles sits near the register at Lee's Washerette and Food Market, a mustard-colored cinder-block bunker on the western fringe
of this Mississippi Delta town.  Those pickles were once mere dills. They were once green. Their exteriors remain pebbly, a reminder that long ago they began their lives on a farm, on the ground, as cucumbers.  But they now have an arresting color that combines green and garnet, and a bracing sour-sweet taste that they owe to a long marinade in cherry or tropical fruit or strawberry Kool-Aid. Kool-Aid pickles violate tradition, maybe even propriety. Depending on your palate and perspective, they are either the worst thing to happen to pickles since plastic brining barrels or a brave new taste sensation to be celebrated. The pickles have been spotted as far afield as Dallas and St. Louis, but their cult is thickest in the Delta region, among the black majority population. In the Delta, where they fetch between 50 cents and a dollar, Kool-Aid pickles have earned valued space next to such beloved snacks as pickled eggs and pigs' feet at community fairs, convenience stores and filling stations. And as their appeal has widened, some people have seen a good business opportunity. Even the lawyers have gotten involved. Children are the primary consumers, but a recent trip through the region revealed that the market for Kool-Aid pickles is maturing...Billie Williams, 56, a special-education teacher at Carver Elementary, never saw one when she was a child. But she did eat dill pickles impaled on peppermint sticks, and she remembers how friends sucked the juice from cut lemons through peppermint sticks repurposed as straws. ''That's the same kind of taste,'' she said. ''Same as how they used to dip pickle spears in dry Kool-Aid mix for that pucker.'' The school sells Kool-Aid pickles from the popular red flavor family at its fund-raisers. ''They're easy to make a gallon,'' Ms. Williams said. ''You pull the pickles from the jar, cut them in halves, make double-strength Kool-Aid, add a pound of sugar, shake and let it sit --best in the refrigerator -- for about a week. The taste takes to anything. A while back I made a mistake and bought a jar of pickle chips instead of halves or wholes. Came out fine. This whole Kool-Aid pickle thing is going so good, you wonder why somebody hasn't put a patent on them.'' No patent application has been filed, but the name Kool-Aid is a trademark owned by Kraft Foods. Upon learning of the pickles, Bridget MacConnell, a senior manager of corporate affairs at Kraft, recovered, and then pronounced, ''We endorse our consumers' finding innovative ways to use our products.''...At the Stephensville Mini-Mart, set amid the cotton fields and catfish
ponds between Shaw and Indianola, the owner, Hugh Davis, began stocking Kool-Aid pickles earlier this year at the behest of local children. ''They're not for me,'' 
said Mr. Davis, 66. ''It's the kids who've done it. They'll create a line of food for you; they'll dab a little something here and there and make it their own. They're
 good at inventing.'' Recently, some Delta grocers began selling jars of ready-made pickles. And entrepreneurs are emerging. At Lambard's Wholesale Meats in 
Cleveland, Allen Williams sells plastic gallon jugs of Best Maid dills, plastered with the Kool-Aid packs that denote the flavor within. (Mr. Williams declined to
 reveal who actually makes his Kool-Aid pickles.)"<br>

<b>About cucumbers:</b><br>
"Cucumbers are generally believed to have originated in India...they have been cultivated
throughout western Asia for at least 3, 000 years. From India, the cucumber srpead to Greece and
Italy-where the crop was significant in the Roman Empire-and slightly later to China and southern
Russia. In Classical Rome, Pliny reported greenhouse production of cucumbers by the first
century, and the Emporer Tiberious was said to have had them at his table throughout the year.
Cucumbers probably were diffused into the rest of Europe by the Romans and later throughout
the New World via colonialism an indigenous trade networks."<br>

"The Curcurbitacae are spread all over the world with different genera originating in different
places and there is a great deal of confusion as to which ones were known to the Greeks and
Romans, the translators of whos works refer to them as melons, pupkins, marrows, gourds, but
offer few clues as to what these really were...Calabashes were found in Twelfth-Dynasty Egyptian
tombs, and their use as bottles or containers for both wine and toilet waters was known to early
Greek and Roman writers incuding Theophrastus and Pliny, who says that both the flesh and the
stalk were eaten, and that in order to reach the flesh the rind had first to be scraped off.
Calabashes could also be preserved in brine like cucumbers..."<br>

"It is often said that the cucumber is the kischschium, one of the fruits of Egypt regretted by the
Israelites in the desert. However, I do not find any Arabic name among the three given by Forskal

cucumber in ancient Egypt."<br>

"Cucumber. Three species of "cucumber" are mentioned in the Bible and in rabbinic literature:
kishu'im, pakku'ot and the yerokat (or yerikat) ha-hamor. (1) Kishu'im: only the plural form
occurs in the Bible, but the singular, kishut, occurs in rabinnic literature. The reference is to the
chate cucumber. (Cucumuis melo, var. Chate) which appears frequently in pictures from ancient
Egypt. It was an important crop and a favorite food there which explains the yearning of the

watermelon seeds and leaves were deposited in Egyptian tombs."<br>

"The ancient Egyptians cultivated the water-melon, which is represented in their paintings. This is
one reason for believeing that the Israelites knew the species, and called it abbatatchim, as is said;
but besides the Arabic name, battich, gatteca, evidently derived form the Hebrew, is the modern
for the water-melon.<br>

<b>So...did Cleopatra eat cucumbers or not?</b><br>
The confusion surrounding the history of cucumbers and pickles is the result of conflicting
linguistic and archaelogical evidence. Food historians generally agree that some members of the
cucurbit family (including melons, watermelons, cucumbers etc.) originated in India approximately
3000 years ago. There is solid evidence that Egyptians ate watermelons. They were also known to
have preserved food by pickling (salt, not vinegar.) If Cleopatra ate pickles they were most likely
watermelons soaked in brine rather than the spicy cucumber/vinegar mix we know today.

Our survey of historic newspapers reveals Plasmon brand food products [UK] were introduced in the early 20th century. 
Originally marketed as a "health" food for invalids and children, the base product was a granulated powder composed of "albumen of pure
fresh milk." This flavor-free nutritional supplement was promoted to consumers as both sprinkle-on enhancement and
cooking ingredient. Before long, the Plasmon product line encompassed a variety of 
products: tea, cocoa, chocolate and biscuits. Plasmon Biscuits were mass produced and sold in the UK, USA, and UK-affiliated countries. They were also sold to
 the military for rations. Ernest Schackleton's Antarctic Nimrod Expeditions (1907-1909) munched Plasmon Biscuits. Plasmon was also 
incorporated into popular recipes.

"The pomegranate tree...is an ancient tree native to the Middle East (probably Iran). Along with 
olives, figs, 
dates, and grapes, the pomegranate was (some 5,000 to 6,000 or more years ago) among the first 
fruits to be 
cultivated. Because pomegranates are hardy and easily transported, they were widely known in 
early times, 
even in regions where they could not be grown. From Mesopotamia, the pomegranate spread out 
to be 
cultivated in ancient Egypt, India, Afghanistan, and China, and reached Europe at a very early 
date. The fruit 
became important in ancient Greek mythology and was mentioned in early literature, including 
the Bible...The 
name "pomegranate" translates literally as "apple with many seeds." <br>

"Pomegranate, Punica granatum, the fruit of a small tree which is native to Iran and still grows 
wild there. The 
trees are small; evergreen of deciduous according to climate; and very long lived. The seed is 
distributed by 
birds which eat the fruit. The pomegranate was well known in ancient Egypt. The Israelites in the 
desert 
regretted the refreshing fruit they had left behind them, so that Moses found it necessary to asure 
them that 
they would find it again in the Promised Land (Deuteronomy 8:8). The fruit was known to the 
ancient Greeks 
and is mentioned in Homer, but it seems to have reached the Romans more circuitously via 
Carthage (Punis) 
in N. Africa...Although the pomegranate has been cultivated and appreciated since antiquity, 
these seeds and 
the fact that the fruit is labourious to consume have held it back from universal 
popularity...Spanish sailors took 
the pomegranate from the Mediterranean region, where it had long been cultivated, to America. It 
was a useful 
fruit for sea voyagers since its hard skin helps it to keep well. It became established in the south 
of the USA 
and the, in the 18th century, in California. The fruit had also spread eastwards, to India and 
China. The first 
mention in Indian literature is of the 1st century AD...In China the fruit was grown in the warm 
south and sent to 
colder regions as an exotic delicacy."

"Pomegranate, segmented fruit whose juice can be drink and seeds had many medicinal uses in 
the classical 
world. The pomegranate, native to Iran, was familiar in Egypt by the mid second millennium BC: 
its 
unmistakable shape appears frequently on wall paintings from then onwards. By the beginning 
of the archaic 
period it was well known in Greece. It is one of the fruit trees that characterizes the orchards of 
Alcinous in the 
Odyssey. By then the pomegranate was evidently spreading further west: it is represented by 
archaebotanical 
finds in southern France in the last few centuries BC...Early medical authors distinguished three 
kinds of 
pomegranate by their juice, respectively sweet, winy and acid; they prescribed the juice and also 
other 
preparations. Pomegranates were perhaps more significant mythologically than in the diet. They 
were offered 
to the Phoenician goddess Astarte, and to several Greek goddesses. Persephone, while in the 
underworld, is 
said to have sucked on pomegranate seed, and thus to have condemned herself to remain there for 
a third of 
every year." <br>

<p> 
"Pomegranates first reached Britain from southern Europe in the thirteenth century, and they 
were to remain 
for many centuries an expensive luxury, used sparingly and mainly for decoration. In the earliest 
references to it 
in English it is called the poumgarnet, perhaps a conscious allusion to the fruit's deep red 
seeds..." <br>

"Myths and legends of the pomegranate reveal that the ancients both recognized and revered this 
fruit. The 
plant comes from Southeast Asia, and the fruit itself appears in myths of many lands, 
particularly of India, 
China, Mesopotamia, Greece, and Rome. The pomegranate had distinct characteristics that 
beckoned 
mythmakers to assign it significance. It attracted attention because of its crownlike blossom, its 
red color, and 
perhaps most importantly, its many seeds, which people all over the world linked to fertility and 
procreation. 
Ancient mythmakers elevated pomegranates to high status, attributing symbolic significance to 
all of these 
traits." <br>

 make a salad or cooking oil...When the poppyseed ripens, the narcotic substances
 change into harmless forms. The blue-grey seed of the cultivar Hungarian Blue-Seeded
 is the one most commonly used in Europe, especially in baked goods (such as the
 Silesian specialty Mohntorte...and they are commonly sprinkled on top of breads,
 biscuits, and cakes in Germany, E. Europe, and countries of C. Asia. Poppyseeds are
 also used as a flavouring in some egg, potato, and pasta dishes. Indian poppyseed

 that European states have in the last two centuries taken a very close interest in the

When and where did pork and beans originate? Excellent question! Ancient cooks were known
combine salt-preserved meat with legumes. Medieval cooks typically added sweeteners and
spices. Many of these old recipes combined peas with pork, both readily available to the average
person. In England, this was known as <a
href="foodpuddings.html#pease">pease puddung</a> (pottage). 
This Italian recipe from 1475 is
fairly typical:<blockquote>
"Dish Made from Peas. Let peas come to a boil with carob. When they are taken form the water,
put in a frying pan with bits of salt meat, especially that balanced between lean and fat. I would
wish, however, that the bits had been fried a little beforehand. Then add a bit of verjuice, a bit of
must, or some sugar and cinnamon. Cook broad beans in the same way."<br>

</blockquote>
Most (though not all) food historians tell us that pork and beans..as we know them
today...probably came to colonial America via New England. It was a marriage of old world
habits and new world ingredients. Have you ever heard of Boston baked beans? Amelia Simmons
[1798] did
not provide a recipe for pork and beans but she did briefly mention <a
href="http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/display.cfm?TitleNo=1&PageNum=14">small
white
beans</a>, which she thought "excellent." Presumbly these were  pea beans, later called  Navy
beans. <p>
     Pork and beans also played a significant role in American cowboy meals and pioneer dinners.
The ingredients were portable, nutritious, and filled the belly. Mass-produced canned foods were
made possible during the mid 19th century industrial revolution. Many new food companies
embraced this technology. Gilbert Van Camp, Van Camp
Packing Company of Indianapolis was one of the first to can pork and beans. Van Camp is now
owned by Conagra.

<b>Colonial fare</b><br>
"Boston baked beans. A dish of navy beans made with molasses and salt pork or bacon. Some
argue that baked beans were introduced to the colonists by the Indians, but novelist Kenneth
Roberts, in an essay on "The Forgotton Marrowbones," prionted in Marjorie Mosser's Foods of
Old New England (1957), argues that baked beans had long been a traditional Sabbath dish
among North African and Spanish Jews, who called the dish "skanah." Roberts also cites Riley's
Narrative (1816) by James Riley as a source and supposes that New England sea captains brought
the idea home with them from Africa. Nevertheless, the dish clearly became associated with
Boston, whose Puritan settlers baked beans on Saturday, served them that night for dinner, for
Sunday breakfast with codfish cakes and Boston brown bread, and again for Sunday lunch,
because no other cooking was allowed during the Sabbath, which extended into Sunday
evening...Baked beans of this kind were first canned in 1875 by the Burnham E. Morrill Company
of Portland, Maine, for local fishermen..."<br>

"American cookery was heavily influenced by English and German practices. Pork and beans, a
traditional Saturday meal of New England, declined in popularity during the mid-19th century but
gained a new identity when someone thought of canning it, to give the ancestor of modern baked
beans. Molasses is used as a flavouring in this dish; it was also important as a condiment for pork
in general. Sweet ingredients are characteristic of American pork cookery..."<br>

According to the food historians pork (esp. salt pork) figured prominently in the diets of early
New Englanders. 
<p>
"...pork was America's first important meat from domestic animals, and would remain the
country's most common meat for three centuries. Pigs and chickens were, of course, the easiest
meat to carry to the New World by ship, and provided forever the advantage that if unfavorable
winds prolonged the voyage, they could be killed on the way to provide fresh meat for sailors and
passengers." (p. 59)
    "A frequent criticism of the American diet in the early nineteenth century is that Americans
knew no other meat than salt pork...It is possible, however, that this observation on the monotony
of one category of American foods has been a trifle overworked. It is true that Americans did eat
a good deal of salt pork, another reason why the American sweet tooth developed to such
inordinate proportions: "So much salt pork was eaten by so many Americans in the 19th century,"
Dale Brown wrote in <i>American Cooking</i>, "That molasses, the most popular of sweeteners,
was
regularly used to subdue the briny taste."" (p. 131) <br>

<b>Pork & Beans as Cowboy food</b><br>

time/cooking facilities to prepare such food. They required hours of soaking before they could be
prepared for dinner. But! History reminds us never to underestimate the ingenuity of a dedicated
cook. These people were revered for their energy,  abundance and creativity. It is quite likely the
experienced cowboy's cook knew how to adjust his methods for cooking beans to have meals
ready at the appointed time. The most feasible explanation is that the cook started soaking his

"According to J. Frank Dobie in <i>Up the Trail From Texas</i>, the chuck wagon, the traveling
commissary from which the trail-driving cowboys and horse wranglers were fed, appeared to be a
good many years after the fist post-Civil War drives....The chuck wagon itself evolved from the
cart, sometimes driven by oxen, which carried the personal gear of the crew and the trail boss, and
a few pots of beans cooked on the overnight stops...On the drives, the cook hurried the chuck
wagon forward past the slow-moving cattle to set up at the next planned stopping place and have
food ready for the drivers when the her arrived. He needed a good head start to give him time to
bake the omnipresent red Mexican beans )"prairie strawberries," the cowboys called them)."<br>

<b>American pork and bean recipes through time:</b><p><blockquote>

<b>"Pork and Beans</b><br>
Take two quarts of dried white beans, (the small ones are best,) pick out any imperfections, and
put them to soak in cold water, more than to cover them, let them remain one night; the next day,
about two hours before dinner time, throw off the water; have a pound of nicely corned pork, a
rib piece is best; put the beans in an iron dinner-pot; score the rind or skin of the pork, in squares
or diamonds, and lay it on the beans, put in hot (not boiling) water to them, add a small dried red
pepper, or a saltspoon-ful of cayenne; cover the pot close, and set it over a gentle fire for one
hour; then take a tin basin, or earthen pudding-pan, rub the inside over with a bit of butter, and
nearly fill it with the boiled beans, lay the pork in the centre, pressing it down a little; put small
bits of butter over the beans, dredge a little flour oer them, and the pork, and set it in a
moderately hot oven, for nearly one hour..."<br>

<b>Which kind of bean?</b><br>
It's  the Navy bean...a small white bean...that is traditionally used in historic American recipes and
manufactured pork and bean products. Surprised? Most people are. It is the sauce that makes
these beans look light brown. Picture of navy beans <a

<p>
<b>About Navy beans</b><br>
What we now know as the Navy bean existed long before the U.S. Navy. It is a new world food
that was cultivated and cooked by Native Americans. The military moniker? Food historians tell
us the name was a result of this bean's recognition and utilization by the U.S. Navy for its
nutritious, versatile, and portable  properties. History notes here:
<p>
"Navy bean...Also called "pea bean" or "beautiful bean." The navy bean is one of several varieties
of kidney bean (phaseolus vulgaris). The name comes from the fact that it has been a standard
food of the United States Navy since at least 1856, despite an old popular song that claims that
"the Navy gets the gravy, but the Army gets the beans."<br>
---<i>The Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani
[Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 216)
<p>
"Navy bean...also called the "pea bean," the navy bean is of several varieties of the kidney
bean...that are cultivated for their nutritious white seeds. The name "navy bean" recalls former
times when the beans were among the standard provisions of warships of the U.S. Navy."<br>

<b>Are soy beans sometimee used to make pork & beans?</b> It is possible, though it seem
unlikely. This is what the trade associations
have to say:
<p>
"...whether commercial producers of pork and beans use soy beans. The response from the United
Soybean Board is: To the best of our knowledge, soybeans are
not utilized in the preparation of commercial "pork & beans" type products.
This was confirmed by the Ontario White Bean Producers Board, who represent
navy bean growers in Ontario. They indicated that the finished product
would be significantly different from the usual navy bean product in terms
of flavor, mouthfeel, consistency, etc. and that because of the differences
in preparation methods, it would not make any sense for producers to
interchang or inter mix the two types of beans. After contacting serveral
producers of canned soybeans, it was found that none of these companies
offered such a product nor were they aware of any other companies 
offering such a product. Clare M. Hasler, Ph.D."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Purslane</b></font><br>

Food historians confirm the use of purslane (portulaca oleracea) was known to ancient cooks.
Early salads
featured this green.
<p>
"Purslane is one of the kitchen garden plants most widely diffused throughout the old world from
the
earliest times. It has been transported into America, where it spreads itself, as in Europe, in
gardens among
rubbish, by the wayside, etc. It is more or less used as a vegetable, a medicinal plant, and is
excellent food
for pigs. A Sanskrit name for it is known, lonica or lounia, which recurs in the modern languages
of India...It
is very difficult to discover in the case of a plant so widely diffused, and which propagates itself
so easily by
means of its enormous number of little seeds, whether a specimen is cultivated, naturalized by
spreading
from cultivation, or really wild."<br>
---<i>Origin of Cultivated Plants</i>, Alphonse de Candolle [Hafner Publishing:New York] 1964 (p.
87-8)
<p>
"Many quaint recipes using pursley or purslane can be found. Giles Rose, one of the master
cooks to
Charles II, suggested in 1682 a recipe fr "A Sappet of Lettice and Purslane --Take out the newest
Purslane
pick and wash it very well, swing it out, and lay in the round of the plate, and Lettice round about
it. Garnish
the brims with Charvile and Flowers hashed together of divers colors, very small." Cook books
of that day
also gave recipes for pursely soup as well as preserved and pickled pursely. Apparently it was
look upon by
gourmets as a delicacy. Preserved purslane was served "as a first dish on the table to produce an
appetiti afore the guests settle down to meate," according to Henry Dethick, writing in England some 400
years ago.
American Indians used pursley as a pot herb. The early American settlers compared its flavor
with
asparagus."<br>

<a name="ramps">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Ramps</b></font><br>
If you hail from America's Applachian region, you know about ramps. These early leeks herald spring. Noted for their
pungent fragrance and old-timey tonic properties, ramps command their own festivals. 

  <p>
  "Ramps...also called wild leeks, are members of the onion family. Native to eastern North
  America, ramps grow in clumps in the rich, moist soil under deciduous trees--sugar
  maples, birch, and poplar, among others--from New England south to central Appalachia
  and as far as North Carolina and Tennessee. One of the first spring greens, growing from
  perennial bulbs in late March and April, ramps have the flavor of sweet spring onions
  touched with musk and an intense garlic aroma. They are harvested for their young leaves
  (which resemble lily of the valley) and their small bulbs. Both may be eaten raw--the
  leaves, for instance, in salads, though the bulbs are frequently fried in smoky fat with
  eggs or potatoes. Ramps were part of the Native American diet, valued for their blood-cleasning properties and eaten 
eagerly at winter's end (ramps are, in fact, high in vitamin
  C). Over time the ramp harvest became a rite of spring in many Appalachian
  communities, giving way to community festivals. Ramp consumption and popularity rose
  steadily in the last two decades of the twentieth century, threatening the wild populations
  in the forests from which they are gathered. Up to 85 percent of ramps are consumed as
  food from wild populations, though efforts are under way in North Carolina and
  elsewhere to cultivate them."<br>

  The Cook County community, nested, in the shadow of the Great Smoky Mountains, goes
  wild over the odoriferous mountain leek, staging a Ramp Festival...But Cosby isn't alone.
  Ramps are celebrated across the lofty, fertile, and shady coves in Southern
  Appalachia...The Appalachian "ramp country" ranges from West Virginia to north
  Georgia. Wild ramps, a member of the lily family, and called "Tennessee Truffles" by
  some, flourish in buckeye flats...old-time mountain people love the wild leek. Take Gary
  Davis, a retired conservation ranger from Fannin County, Georgia. "If I don't get some
  ramps to eat in the spring, I may not make it to the fall. It slicks you off [as a tonic],
  makes you feel good and do good all summer...Appalchian highlanders have been enjoying ramps for centuries...The Cherokees called them
Wa-S-Di, 'a smelly business but good.'...Ramps are adaptable to many dishes. They can be cooked with eggs, potatoes, venison, 
bear meat, ham..."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Rice Krispies Treats</b></font><br>
Rice Krispies-type treats existed long before the name-brand cereal was invented. This snack
traces its roots to the middle of the 19th century when  recipes for puffed grain treats mixed with
sweeteners (molasses, corn syrup) pressed into various shapes were popular. Think:
popcorn balls & <a href="foodcookies.html#nobakes">no-bakes</a>.
<p>
Alexander Anderson, American Cereal Company is generally credited for inventing the process
for puffing cereal grains in the early 20th century. These were introduced to the American public
at the 1904 Exposition in St. Louis. Some details on the person and the process <a
href="http://www.andersoncenter.org/history.html">here</a>. According to the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov">U.S. Patent & Trademark Office</a>,
Kellogg's Rice Krispies cereal was introduced to the American public February 29, 1928 (registration #024993). 
<p>
The earliest recipe we have approximating Rice Krispies Treats is circa WWI. It comes from a 7th grade home-economics notebook suggesting
the recipe was considered healthy, easy, and economical by contemporary nutrition experts. <br><blockquote>
"<b>[1916]<br>

2 tbs. Molasses<br>
1/2 tbs. Salt<p>
Boil sugar-water & vinegar together for five min. Then add mol., butter, salt & boil until it is
brittle when tried in cold water. Add the heated puffed rice & spread in butter tins."<br>

<b>[1938]</b>
<i>It's fun to Cook</i>, Lucy Mary Maltby [John C.

ingredients: 2 teaspoons butter, 1 cup molasses, 1/3 cup granulated sugar
1/2 tablespoon vinegar, 1 package puffed wheat (3 1/2 oz.) The directions are similar to those of
Rice Krispies Treats, the picture of the finished product (p. 219) confirms similarity. The caption
under the picture reads "Inexpensive and tasty are these Puffed Wheat Squares," indicating their
appeal to economical cooks. A suggested variation includes melted chocolate poured on top.

<b>So, who "invented" the Rice Krispies treats we enjoy today?</b><br>
According to Iowa State University School of Agriculture it was
"Mildred Day, who died in June [1996] at the age of 92, was a 1928 home economics graduate
from Iowa State. Day is credited with the development of Rice Krispies Treats. She worked for
Kellogg Co., the maker of Rice Krispies, and used the cereal to develop the snack as a fundraiser
for a Camp Fire Girls group." <br>

<p>
"[Mildred] Day was born in Durham, a village 8 1/2 miles east of Knoxville in Marion County
[Iowa]. She was a home economics graduate of Iowa Sate University in Ames. Her family says
Day, who worked at Kellogg Co. in Battle Creek, Mich., developed the recipe with Malitta Jensen
as a fund-raiser for a Camp Fire Girls group. Anthony Hebron, Kellogg spokesman, says Rice
Krispies cereal went on the market in 1928 and Rice Krispies Treats, a trademarked name, were
introduced in the 1940s. The recipe first appeared on packaging in 1941. "Many of our employees
created concoctions with Kellogg products," Hebron says."<br>

<a name="ratafia">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Ratafia</b></font><br>

"Ratafia, a word whos three meanings are explained below. The origin is obscure. According to Favre (1883-92), the word is 
derived from the Latin phrase Res rata fiat, which was pronounced when a treaty or other such instrument was ratified. 
Since the custom was to accompany the ratification by drinking a good liqueur, the phrase, abbreviated, became a name for 
such a liqueur. If this is the origin of the name, it would explain why there is doubt about whether the name applies to 
all liqueurs or only some and, if only some, which. (It is usually understood to apply to liqueur made from brandy and any
 fruit juice, especially those made by a process of maceration; but some authorities regard a flavouring of bitter almonds 
as necessary.) The three meanings of ratafia are: <br>
1. Ratafia, a drink popular in the 17th and 18th centuries, probably of French origin. It was a cordial or a brandy-based 
liqueur flavored with almonds, peach, cherry, or apricot kernels, or soft fruits; similar to Noyau, a word which came 
into use in the late 18th century and largely supplanted ratafia. <br>
2. Ratafia, an 18th- and 19th-century variation on the Macaroon, flavored with bitter almonds...or sometimes with apricot 
kernels. These seen to have been first made in England in the early 18th century to recipes very similar to macaroons, 
and used similarly; ratafia biscuits my have acquired the name because they were eaten with the drink ratafia, so because 
of the use of bitter almonds as flavouring in both items. Very small almond biscuits are still manufactured under the
 name of 'ratafias'. <br>
3. The word is also used to describe a bitter almond flavour; for instance, 'essence of ratafia'...or 'ratafea cream'
 (a desert flavoured with apricot kernels)..." <br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 654) 
<p>
"There is ratafia you can drink, and there are ratafias you can eat, and their common
denominator is the taste of almonds or similar nutty kernels. The drink came first. It is a liquer
made by steeping some flavouring ingredient in sweetened spirit. In France, this ingredient can
be any of a range of fruits, such as blackcurrants or oranges, as well as kernels, but in English
usage the term has always been largely restricted to a drink flavoured with peach, apricot, or
cherry kernels or particularly with almonds...English originally acquired the term towards the
end of the seventeenth century, and in the early nineteenth century applied it to a sort of small
biscuit...The word ratafia comes originally from French West Indian creole, where it appears to
have referred to the local spirit, rum. Popular etymology attributes the creole term to Latin,
ratificare,  'ratify', the notion being that it referred to a drink taken to seal or  'ratify' a deal, but
there is no direct evidence of this."<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 278-9)
<p>
"Ratafia. As used by Hannah Glasse, 111, the word indicates the flavour of almonds. Its meaning can be more generally 
embracing the flavours imparted by the kernels of peaches, apricots and cherries. The cordial or liqueur called ratafia
 may be flavoured with any of these. Ratafia cakes and biscuits may be similarly flavoured; or they may be so called 
because they are intended to be eaten with the liqueur." <br>

Food historians tell us rhubarb is an ancient plant originating in southwestern Russia. The name is
likewise ancient has interesting story (see below). The term <a href="foodfaq2.html#pieplant">"pie plant"</a> originated in the United States,
sometimes during the 19th century. It derives from the fact that rhubarb was a popular pie filling. 
<p>
<b>Why call it "rhubarb?"</b><br>
"Rhubarb" comes from the Latin Rhabarbarun, "Rha of the barbarians." Rha is the name of the river on
whose banks rhubarb was cultivated by the barbarians...the barbarians...were Tartars."<br>

<b>Where did rhubarb originate?</b><br>
China, Russia & Siberia. Take your pick.
<p>
"Chinese rhubarb (Rheum officinale) is used mostly for medical purposes. Garden rhubarb (R.
Rhabarbarum) is grown for its edible stalks. The plant is native to southwestern Russia, southern Siberia,
and China, where it was grown in ancient times for the alleged medicinal value of its roots. Rhubarb was
cultivated in Europe from at least the seventeenth century and reached North America shortly after the
American Revolution."<br>

University Press:Cambridge] 2001, Volume Two (p. 1843)
<p>
"Rhubarb seems to have originated in China, and was first imported to the West via Russia for the sake of
its root, which in medieval times was dried, ground up, and used as a purgative. Ancient names for it
included Greek rha and Perisan rewend, which were in due course to converve to produce rhubarb. The
term rha was said by the Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus to have been taken from the ancient
name of the River Volga...It was borrowed into late Latin as rha, and had tacked on to it the adjective
barbarum--hense rhababarum, literally  foreign rhubarb'. Here, Persian rewend enters the picture again.
Greek  had borrowed this as rheon, which in Latin became rheum...In medieval Latin the two words for
 rhubarb' became blended together to produce rheubarbarum, which was eventually shortened to
rheubarbum."<br>

<b>Rhubarb in Britian</b><br>
"Rhubarb was known in classical Greece and Rome as an imported dried root with medicinal
qualities...There is some debate about how far back Chinese knowledge of rhubarb extends. Pen Khing's
herbal, of about 2700 BC, listed it; but Laufer (1978) says the work is spurious...It does, however, seem to
be certain that it was known by the age of Han, 206 BC; that is was valued medicinally; that it developed
into an important article of trade from China to W. Asia during the 10th century. In England, rhubarb
became known, at first in a purely medicinal context, in the 16th century. The idea of eating the stem may
have occurred to people, much later, because of the resemblance between rhubarb and its smaller
relation, sorrel. Indeed, several dock varieties have 'rhubarbic' sobriqutes, such as monk's rhubarb for mountain dock, and
curled dock is even preferred to rhubarb by some Australians. Another naturlaist, Peter Collinson, worte in 1739 about
'Siberian rhubarb' pie with sugar and cinnamon. However, it was some time before rhubarb recipes becan to appear in English cookery
books, perhaps waiting for sugar to be more widely available to sweeten the taste. One early example was in Mrs. Rundell (1806). Other 
recipes for sweet pies and tarts followed during the first half of the 19th century."<br>

"One of the latest garden fruits to be cultivated in England was rhubarb. Medicinal rhubarb, the rhubarb grown in China from the
third milllennium BC onwards for the sake of its root, a powerful purgative, had been traded to the west since Roman times. There was
more than one varity, and the names Turkey rhubarb and Barbary rhubarb were given to two of them, denoting countries through
wich passed the medieval spice routs whereby they traveled. In the Tudor period the plants themselves were introduced into
English herb gardens, and medicinal rhubarb became a garden crop in Nritain. The Duke of Atholl had a famous plantation of Turkey rhubarb
on his estate at Blair Castle in Perthshire in the 1770s, and sold the roots to an Edinburgh druggist. The rhubarb now eaten as
a fruit arrived in the seventeeth century, when John Parkinson received seeds from Italy and planted them in his garden. He described
the leaf stalks, some two feet long and the thickness of a man's thumb, and thought a syrup might be made from the juice which
would pure more gently than rhubarb from the East Indies or China. The cultivation of garden rhubarb spread in Britain in the 
eighteenth century, with the encouragement during the later years from the Royal Society of Arts...Garden rhubarb was a new acquisition for tarts. A recipe which appeared in the 1790s advocated slicing the stalks, and then
treating them in the manner of gooseberries."<br>

<b>Rhubarb in America</b><br>
Benjamin Franklin is generally credited for introducing Chinese rhubarb to America:

This type of rhubarb was used for medicinal purposes, unlike the edible rhubarb that was already
grown in America."<br>

"Rhubarb...was introduced to Maine at the end of the eighteenth century when a gardener obtained seeds
of roots from Europe. Cultivation soon flourished in Massachusetts, and by 1822 rhubarb was sold in New
England produce markets. In the late nineteenth century, the great plant breeder Luther Burbank
developed a mild variety with a long growing season well suited to California. Early Americans used
rhubarb extract and syrup for dyspepsia and a variety of bowel complaints...Nineteenth-century American

strawberries for sweet and tangy flavor punch.

  Risotto is not one dish, but many flavorful blends and interesting recipe variations. As
  with many traditional foods, there are many conflicting theories regarding the origin of
  risotto. Some culinary experts place risotto in the 16th century; others claim risotto (as we
  know it today) is a 20th century dish. 
  <p>
  Culinary historians generally agree the first risotto-type foods likely orginated during the
  Renaissance, in the Lombardy region, Milan being famous for this dish. History confirms
  wealthy Milanese families recognized this grain's market potential [when grain was
  scarce, prices would rise] and capitalized on it. The rice traders became very rich,
  according to some accounts, rice was sometimes proferred as gifts. <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/books/kiple/rice.htm">
About rice</a> (general).
  <p>
  The first rice dishes in this region were borrowed from the Mediterranean cuisines
  responsible for introducing rice to Italy. They were typically sweet recipes combining
  rice, almond milk and spices. Together, Milanese cooks and local ingredients eventually
  created a unique dish. Historic American cook books confirm risotto was cooked in
  America beginning the late 19th century, though it did not become widely accepted until
  after World War II. This is true of many Italian dishes, including pizza. Amercian chefs
  *rediscovered* risotto in the 1980s, elevating this dish from simple & economical to
  gourmet status.
  <p>
  Italian rice is short-grained. There are many varieties. Arborio rice is the type most often
  use by current American chefs when making risotto.
  <p>
  "How did rice get to Western Europe from China? The Persians and Mesopotamians first
  encountered rice towards the fifth century BC, as a result of diplomatic and trading
  contacts between Darius and the Chinese and Indian states. Rice-growing reached Egypt
  and Syria during the next two centuries...Southern Spain owed its first rice-fields to the
  Moors of Andalusia...Several attempts were made to grow rice in Italy in the early Middle
  Ages. At the end of the thirteenth century the Visconti dukes of Milan, a very shrewd
  family, took a personal interest in the possibilities of rice-growing, but it was their
  successors, Galeazzo Sforza and his brother Ludovico Moro, who brought rice to the Po
  delta, and with it prosperity..."<br>

  "One of the unintentional end products of the clearing of the Lombardy plains for the
  establishment of rice fields in the fifteenth century was risotto. The motivation for the
  clearing and reclaimation of the plains was simply the demand of the growing towns for
  food. That demand was met not by rice growers by budding capitalists who had the
  financial wherewithal to back the farmers in establishing these rice fields in the Po
  Valley. One of the earliest references I know of concerning rice in northern Italy is a letter
  of September 27, 1475, from Galeazzo Maria Sfora to the Duke of Ferrara concerning
  twelve sacks of rice....It is a typical part of the story that profit margins were kept high as
  riziculture in Lombardy meant the near enslavement of workers who were not organized,
  including children exposed to barbarous cruelties, according to a Lombard ordinance of
  1590 seeking to stop this practice..."<br>

  when a stained-glass worker on Milan's cathedral, who was known for the yellow color of
  his glass, which he achieved by adding saffron to his pigments, colored the rice at the
  wedding of his boss's daughter, whereupon the guests pronounced the dish "Risus

  Medieval cookery texts sometimes included sweet recipes combining rice, almond milk
  and spices, a recipe originating in Turkey. The fact that rice was thought to have
  medicinal value at that time is confirmed here: 
  <br><blockquote>
  <b>"7. On Rice</b><br>
  Rice [risum], which I think was called oriza in the ancient spelling, is of warm and dry
  force, and for this reason it is very nourishing, especially if it has been seasoned with
  ground almonds, milk, and sugar, as will be described later. When it is cooked down it
  pure water, it constricts the belly. Its frequent use, however, harms those accustomed to
  suffer with pain in the bowel."<br>

Waffles descend from Ancient obleios, batter baked between two hot irons. The impressed patterns we know today

<b>What are waffles?</b><br>
"Waffles, Gaufre. The French waffle is a very light type of sweep pastry cooked between the two buttered and heated plates of waffle iron. The plates, decorated 
with embossed patterns, are fixed to the ends of two long iron stems hinged together. Waffles are mentioned in the poems of the end of the twelfth century when
 they were made and sold in the streets. On great religious feast days the waffle-sellers would set their stalls at the doors of the churches and bake their waffles 
which were eaten piping hot. The best quality waffles were called metiers."<br>

"The ancient Greeks used to cook very flat cakes, which they called obleios, between two hot
metal plates. This method of cooking continued to be used in the Middle Ages by the obloyeurs
who made all sorts of oublies, which were flat or rolled into coronets. The oublie became the
waffle in the 13th century, when a craftsman had the idea of forging some cookie plates
reproducing the characteristic pattern of honeycombs, which at that time were called gaufres
(from the Old French wafla)."<br>

<b>Why do we call them waffles?</b><br>
"The word [waffle] is from the Dutch <b>wafel</b>, and first appeared in English print in 1735.
The item was known to the Pilgrims, who had spent time in Holland before sailing to America in
1620, and waffle parties became popular in the latter part of the eighteenth century. Thomas
Jefferson returned from France with a waffle iron, a long-handled patterned griddle that encloses
the batter and gives it its characteristic crispness and shape. A century later vendors on city streets
sold waffles hot and slathered with molasses or maple syrup.
     Waffles continued to be extremely popular breakfast items in the twentieth century, an electric
waffle irons made the timing of the cooking easier. Then, in 1953 Frank Dorsa introduced frozen
waffles into supermarkets, calling them Eggo Waffles. At the 1964 World's Fair <b>Belgian

they are sold today at stands, county fairs, carnivals, and other fast-food outlets."<br>

hot and delicious. Who knew? Waffles could be the perfect dessert! 
<p>
"The one food delicacy sure to survive the closing, this weekend, of the New York World's Fair is the Belgian waffle. It is due
to join the international roster of staple snacks, along with hot dogs, pizza pies, and ice cream. First the Brussels Fair in 1958, then
the Seattle Fair, and two years running of the New Yor Fair have managed to launch this tasty confection in fair fashion. Literally
millions of visitors to New York have enjoyed that delectable aroma of waffles crisping to a golden brown in hot ovens. As their defense mechanisms
toppled and they chirped, 'I'll have one,' an attendant would decorate that 3 1/2 X 7-inch slab of golden goodness with ribbons of
whipped ream pushed through a pastry gun, then splash it generously with squishy strawberries, and hand it over...Most people ate them
off a waxed napkin. Those who wanted to be daintier cut them up with a fork...Is the Belgian waffle from Belgium? Of course. That country
has been famous for its waffles for generations. Belgians make them at home and serve them with whipped cream or butter, and 
sometimes with fresh fruit. They like them for afternoon tea or dessert. Waffles have thrived for years as a delicacy at Belgian
seaside resorts. The original Belgian waffle, to be commercialized at international fairs is called by the copyrighted name of
'Bel-Gem Waffle.' It is made here by B.F.E. Company, Inc., an American offshoot of a Belgian wafflemaking outfit which dates back
to 1818. More than 3,000,000 Bel-Gem waffles will have been sold at 99 cents each by this company's seven concessions by the time the
New York World's Fair closes Oct. 17. The president of this company is hoping not only to sell its World's Fair wafflemaking
equipment but franchises for making them to dealers across the country...This original Belgian waffle has been joined at the fair by 
many reasonable facsimiles--including Belgium Waffles, Belgische Wafels, and Brussels Waffles. They are fluffy, more than
an inch deep, and made over gas heat, which is said to be the most dependable and constant. Once the fair is closed forever, don't
be surprised to see Belgian waffles turning up out your way. Five young businessmen in Chicago, inspired by the World's Fair success of
the Belgian waffle, have already  formed a company called Belgian Queen, Inc. The designed their own wafflemaking machine and are
having it manufactured here. They had a food company work out their own waffle-mix formula and even their own whipped topping
mix. They are now making Belgian Queen waffles available at 75 cents and 80 cents in department stores, amusement parks, motels,
state fair, drive-ins, resorts, etc. Being adventurous fellows, they are also experimenting with many kinds of topping, including 
fresh peaches, berries of all kinds, coconut, pineapple, and chocolate-mocha."<br>

Did you know that the first pancake-type foods were eaten by prehistoric peoples? No, they were
<b>not</b> the same pancakes we eat today. These simple, fried concoctions of milk, flour, eggs
and spices were called "Alita Dolcia" (Latin for "another sweet") by the Ancient Romans.
Depending upon the proportion of ingredients and method of cooking, the finished product might
have approximated pancakes, fritters, omlettes, or custard. Some of these dishes were sweet
(fruit, nuts, honey); others were savory (cheese, fish, meat). These ancient recipes are also
thought to be the relatives of waffles, cakes, muffins, fritters, spoonbread and doughnuts.
Pancakes, as we Americans know them today, were "invented" in Medieval Europe.
<p>
Throughout history,
pancake ingredients (finest available wheat flour, buckwheat, cornmeal, potatoes), cooking
implements (ancient bakestones, medieval hearths, pioneer griddles perched on campfire embers,
microwave ovens), social rituals (Shrove Tuesday crepes, Chanukah latkes, mass quantities for
community pancake breakfast fundraisers) and final product (thick or thin, savory or sweet, slathered with butter and
smothered with syrup, or gently rolled around delicate fruit) have reflected regional cuisine and
local customs. Cake-like <a href="foodcakes.html#galette">galettes</a> [France], thick potato

The connection between pancakes and Shrove Tuesday (the day before the Christian season of

Apicius; these were made from a batter of egg, mixed milk and water, and a little flour, fried and
served with pepper and honey...Throughout Europe pancakes had a place among Easter foods, especially
on Shrove Tuesday (or Mardi Gras), the last day before Lent. Customs varied from country to
country...One peculiarly English institution is the pancake race. The oldest of these has been held
at Olney in Buckinghamshire, in most years since 1445..."<br>

"Pancakes are traditionally served on Candlemas and Shrove Tuesday, to celebrate renewal,
family life, and hopes for good fortune and happiness in the future. It is customary in France to
touch the handle of the frying pan, and make a wish while the pancake is turned, holding a coin in
the hand. In French rural society, crepes were also considered to be a symbol of allegiance:
farmers offered them to their landowner...."<br>

"Pancakes, which were so popular in all classes, could be made with the simplest kind of
equipment. A skillet and a grill over a heap of small coals or wood were alll that was needed. For
the hurried professional cook, pancakes were a boon. They were easily an quickly prepared. They
were also useful to intersperse with the fish and egg dishes for fast- or fish-day meals, as well as
to fill menus on meat days. One of the advantages of such batters, then and now, is that they can
be mixed up ahad of time."<br>

<b>In Sweden, pancakes are traditional Thursday winter's night dessert, following pea soup. This
hearty combination has been enjoyed since the Middle Ages:</b>
<br>
"Swedish pea soup is regarded as a real national dish. It has been served every Thursday in most
Swedish homes for hundreds of years. During the cold winter it makes a very satisfying meal,
economical as well as filling. The soup is served as a main course with boiled pork, The traditional
dessert after pea soup is Swedish Pancakes or "Plattar", served with jam or lingonberrries...It
makes very good eating, although it is a bit on the heavy side for modern poeple...The exact
cooking time of the peas is hard to say, some peas take longer than others. There is no harm in
overcooking, so you can easily cook soup ahead of time."<br>

<b>In the United States, pancakes are commonly served for breakfast:</b>
<br>
"Pancakes have long been a staple of the American breakfast table, and their history is as old as
that of the Native Americans who shaped a soft batter in their hands and called it, in the
Narragansett,  nokehick (it is soft), transmuted by early white settlers into " no cake." Cornmeal
pancakes were called "Indian cakes" as early as 1607. The Dutch in America made similar cakes
from buckwheat, panekoeken, which by 1740 were called "buckwheat cakes." English settlers
brought with them the feast of Pancake Tuesday, an old name for Shrove Tuesday, the day before
the Lenten fast begins...By 1745 Americans were also referring to  hoe cakes," perhaps because
they were cooked on a flat hoe blade...One of the most beloved versions of this simple cake is the
Johnnycake [also known as journey cake], specifically associated with Rhode Island...The word
"pancake" itself was not in general usage until the 1870s..."<br>

<b>What is a flapjack?</b><br>
Flapjacks (aka flatjacks, slapjacks) is an American name for a variety of pancake-type foods. Food historians generally

denoted at sort
of thick pancake ('a Flapjack, which in our translation is called a Pancake,' John Taylor,
Jack-a-Lent, 1620),
and that is how it is still used in the USA. Flap in this context means 'toss'. According to the
<i>Oxford

applejack in

<b>Pancake syrups</b><br>
<a href="foodcandy.html#maplesugar">Maple syrup</a> was crafted by Native Americans and adopted by European colonists. 
 Modern pancake syrups (aka imitation maple syrups, artificial maple syrups, blended maple syrups, syrups) were introduced to American
 consumers in the late 1880s as an affordable alternative to the "real thing." Quite possibly before (and after) this time, products containing less than 100% pure
 maple syrup were sold to unwary consumers by unscrupulous businessmen. Food adulteration was a popular topic of the late 19th/early 20th century. This was 
the genesis of the U.S. Food and Drug Administation. Pure food laws [1906] to current labeling regulations attempt to help consumers know exactly what is 
contained in commercial food products. 
<p>
"[1887] Log Cabin Syrup is introduced by St. Paul, Minn., grocer P.J. Towle, who blends maple syrup (45 percent) and cane-sugar syrup to produce a product much lower in price than pure maple syrup. He markets it in a tin container shaped and decorated to look like the boyhood home of his boyhood hero Abraham Lincoln."
<br>---<i>Food Chronology</i>, James Trager [Henry Holt:New York] 1995 (p. 326)
<p>
"Maple sugar was an important food in the American diet throughout the 1700s. By the late 1800s, however, maple sugar and maple syrup were becoming
 expensive luxuries, especially outside the New England states. Many people who preferred the taste of maple syrup had to make do with less expensive
 corn syrup- or molasses. It was this need for an affordable, maple-flavored syrup that led Patrick J. Towle to create Log Cabin syrup in 1887. Towle 
reportedly named his syrup "Log Cabin" in honor of his boyhood hero, Abraham Lincoln. He registered the log cabin as a trademark in 1897...In 1897 Towle
 began to sell his syrup in small cabin-shaped tins manufactured in St. Paul by the Horn & Danz Company, a forerunner of the American Can Company, which
 continued to make the tins into the 1950s. The handmade cabin design was patented by James William Fuller of St. Paul on April 20, 1897. The packaging was an 
enormous success and helped popularize Towle's Log Cabin Maple Syrup...Like many products at the turn of the century, Towle's Log Cabin Maple Syrup was promoted with a vareity of novelty itmes...In the early 1900s, Log Cabin syrup was marketed primarily to women, the homemakers of the era, as a way to please their husbands."
<br>---<i>Encyclopedia of Consumer Brands</i>, Volume 1: Consumable Products, Janice Joregensen, editor [St. James Press:Detroit] 1994 (p. 344-5)
<p>
"Cane and corn syrups, along with artificial maple flavoring and a dash of caramel, have take over. Log Cabin started out in the 1880's intended to be an economical substitute for pure maple. It had 45 per cent maple then, and the level was reduced in stages over the decades as maple became more expensive and, in years when the weather was less than perfect, less readily obtainable...Aunt Jemima, a relative newcomer--it began with 15 per cent maple in 1966--dropped the maple primarily becuase of the weather'scaprices and because the company didn't think a vestigal touch of the stuff made much difference to the taste. "
<br>---"How Much Maple is in Maple Syrup?," Richard Flaste, <i>New York Times</i>, June 30, 1975 (p. 36) [NOTE: This article references US government labeling regulations requiring "maple syrups" to have at least 10 per cent maple. Items with less than that percentage are simply called syrup, or the word syrup was dropped completely.]
<p>
"Pancake lovers, beware! The producer of Aunt Jemima pancake syrup hasn't bought a single drop of pure maple syrup this year because maple syrup costs 
$12 a gallon, and Americans have come to like--eve prefer--the taste and consistency of imitation syrup. 'Our consumer tests showed that many people like the 
artificial stuff better than the real thing,' commented a spokesman for the Quaker Oats Company, which owns the Aunt Jemima name. 'Over the years they've gotten
 uses to it.'...The largest food-proccesing companies, which produce Log Cabin, Vermont Maid, Mrs. Butterworth's and Aunt Jemima syrup, have either cut the 
content of real maple syrup down to 3 per cent from 15 per cent or are not including any of the real thing at all."
<br>---"Maple Syrup on the Wane," <i>New York Times</i>, May 4, 1975 (p. 193)
<p>
Of course, not everyone thought pancake syrup was a good idea:<br>
"Someone has patented an imitation maple syrup. Such a patent can't hold water to a "new and useful invention." It would be just as sensible to grant a patent on the pyramids. If some one would patent a genuine maple syrup he would deserve the thanks fo every devotee of buckwheat.--Buffalo Express."

<b>About crepes</b><br>
Like <a href="foodfaq2.html#pancakes">pancakes</a>, crepes trace their roots back to ancient Roman times.
In Medieval France they
were connected with Candlemas and Shrove Tuesday, as symbols of good fortune and family life. 
<p>
"Crepe, a pancake, made by cooking a thin batter sparingly in a very thin layer in a frying or
special crepe pan. The word comes from the Latin "crispus," meaning curly or wavy...Pancakes
[and crepes] are traditionally served on Candlemas and Shrove Tuesday, to celebrate renewal,
family life and hopes for good fortune and happiness in the future. It is customary in France to
touch the handle of the frying pan and make a wish while the pancake is turned, holding a coin in
the hand. In French rural society, crepes were also considered to be a symbol of allegiance:
farmers offered them to their landowner...In western France, particularly in Brittany, crepes are
prepared throughout the year and served with salted butter...Crepes...were extolled by Anatole
France in Le Temps...In traditional cookery, crepes are served as a hot hors d'oeuvre, filled with a
fairly thick mixture of veloute sauce with mushroooms, ham, Gruyere cheese or seafood. They
may also be cut into find strips and used to garnish soup. Most often, however, crepes are
prepared as sweet dishes."<br>

<p>
"Crepes seem to be a French specialty. Neither the <i>crispa</I> and <i>crispelli</I> found
respectively in Latin and Italian texts nor the "cryspes" in English sources are really similar to
what we think of a crepes: a mixture of flour, eggs, and liquid (milk or cream nowadays; water
and wine in the Middle Ages) made into thick pancakes in a shallow pan. There is indeed every
reason to think that this preparation is specific to France, where it was already being prepared in
the pan known as a <i>galettiere</i>, judging by the description in <i>Le Menagier de Paris</i>
of a low-rimmed skipped with perpendicular, not flared sides ("as broad at the top as at the
base"), which is the shape of a galettiere. On the other hand, <i>crispa</i> and <i>crispelli</i>
were made of a leavened dough and were deep fried. While "cryspes" were indeed cooked in the
same was as crepes, they were made of only flour and egg whites."<br>

Crepes.<br>
Take some four, and moisten it with eggs, as many yolks as whites, with the filaments removed,

some lard on the fire in a little iron pan, or half lard and half fresh butter, and let it bubble; and
then take a bowl pierced with a hold as wide as your little finger, and then put the batter in a dish;
beginning with the center, let it flow all over the pan; then put it in a plate with powdered sugar
on tip. And that iron or bronze pan should hold three chopines, and have a rim half a

<b>Who invented Crepes Suzette?</b><br>
"A Crepe Suzette is a light pancake served rolled up or folded over in an orange sauce, sprinkled with an orange-based liqueur or
brandy and flambeed at table. It seems to have come on the scene around the turn of the twentieth century, but its prcise origins
and the reason for its name are not clear. The chef Henri Charpentier made great play with having invented the dish at the Cafe de Paris,
Monte Carlo in 1896 for the Prince of Wales, and named it after the young lady who was the prince's companion on that particular
occasion, but his claim has been shown to be an imposture. The first know preference to such crepes in print comes in August Escofferi's
<i>Modern Cookery</i> 1907), in which he refers to them by the English name <i>Suzette pancakes</i>."
---<i>An A to Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 96)
<p>
"In 1897 Suzanne Reichenberg, an actress who was known professionally by the simple name of Suzette, was appearing at the 
Comedie Francaise in the role of a maid. The plot of the play involved a meal at which she served crepes. Monsieur Joseph,
proprieter of the nearby Restaurant Marivaux, provided the crepes for each perfomance. To attract the attention of the audience
as well as to heat the creps for the actors who must eat them night after night, they were served flambe. Later Joseph moved on to 
the savoy Hotel in London and served his now famous dessert to the diners there. The widely accepted claim of Henri Charpentier, 
French maitre d'hotel and later restaurant owner in the United States, that he invented the crepes almost accidentally while serving
Edward, Prince of Wales, is completely spurious. It is possible, though, that it was he who made them seem the essence of
sophistication to many Americans during the 1930s."

<p>
<b>Who was Henri Charpentier?</b><br>
"Henri Charpentier, one of the world's great chefs, who frequently was credited with being the creator of crepes Suzette...He was
chef to the royalty at the turn of the century, the dandies of Edwardian England, the millionaires of America's flourishing twenties,
and ended his days serving sumptuous meals in a tiny cottage to a clientele that included the notables of Hollywood...Among those
he cooked for were Queen Victoria, King Edward VII of England, King Leopold of Belgium, Sarah Bernhardt...John D. Rockefeller, 
Diamond Jim Brady, Lillian Russell and President Theodore Roosevelt...M. Charpentier operated one of the world's most unusual
restaurants in his home at this seaside suburb [Redondo Beach, California]. Clients had to place reservations four years in  advance
to get served. The dining room held twelve, sometimes sixteen persons. The dinner stook all day to prepare and four hours to 
consume, and cost $8. While the guests dined, M. Charpentier usually sat in a rocking chair near bu, regaling them with remininiscences
of an age the world will never see again...M. Charpentier, born in Nice, France, was a cousin of the famed chef, August Escoffier.,
and also his student...The famed chef loved to tell guests at his restaurant the story of a memorable breakfast sixty-five years
ago on the terrace of the Cafe de Paris in Monte Carlo. 'I was only 16...and was serving the Prince of Wales...later Edward VII...
Among the diners at the Prince's tables was a beautiful French girl named Suzette...His Highness ordered crepes...I mixed the sauce
and added a brandy blend of my own. As I did, the flame of the chafing dish accidentally set the simmering cordials afire.
'I was embarrassed, but I did not show it. I poured the fiery sauce on the crepes, as if the flames were set on purpose. The prince 
tasted, then he smiled, and said" 'Henri, what have you done with these crepes? They are superb!' ' I was thrilled, and offered to 
name them in his honor. But he declined...he said, 'We must always remember that the ladies come first. We will call this glorious
thing crepes Suzette.'...Henri's in East Rockaways, L.I. was perhaps the island's most famous restaurant from the century's early
years until the late Thirties. It had neither menus, music nor bar service. Such diners as J.P. Morgan, Diamond Jim Brady and Marshal
Ferdinand Foch paid staggering bills without comment. After 1930...changing times and tastes forced M. Charpentier to provide
a menu...The restaurant closed in 1938, at which time he blamed high taxes and a lack of appreciation for fine food. He had lost
his other restaurant...in Rockefeller Center, in 1935... when he was evicted for falling behind in rent."<br>

Why crepes are folded in different ways? Interesting question. We are not
finding any official explanation that connects the practice to a particular region or (social,
religious) custom. Our French cookbooks and several Web sites suggest the method of folding is
determined by how the cook envisions the final product. Traditionally, filled crepes are rolled or
stacked; plain or topped crepes are folded in quarters (fan shape).

<b>Injera [Ethiopia]</b><br>
  Injera (enjara) is a thin, round yeast bread which plays an important role in the traditional cuisine

  "A meal begins with ritual handwashing. Water is poured from an ornate jug over the fingers of the
  right hand, whihc are wiped on a clean towel. Only those fingers are used for eating. Breads are
  held in the right hand too, to wrap, scoop, or dip into foods and sauces. For the main meal of the
  day, a dome covers a small round table or a large metal tray. When lifted, a large "cloth" appears
  mounded with portions of stewed foods. The cloth is acutally a very large thin pancake, an
  Ethiopan bread called injera. Often several other kinds of breads will appear as well as a variety of
  stews and combination of meat and vegetables called wots and alechas. Diners enjoy the meal by
  tearing off bits of injera and scooping up foods. Frequently a partner or the host will combine a
  morsel of food and pop it into some else's mouth."<br>

  "Injera is an Ethiopian flat bread--with a difference. This spongy, thin bread is generally made into
  large rounds, a few of which when put together can quite easily cover a tabletop. Indeed, on
  occasions, ingera is used in place of a tablecloth or table covering. Dishes such as doro wot are
  served directly on the ingera tablecloth for big communal meals. The bread is broken off from
  around the edges to scoop up the stew. The idea is to eat from the outside in...Injera is usually
  made from an Ethiopian flour called teff in the Amharic language. Teff is a cereal grain widely
  grown in Ethiopia for human consumption...There are two kinds of teff-red (which is richer in iron
  and minerals) and white--and these account for the local differences in the color of injera."

From ancient times forward, saffron commands the post of "most expensive" spice. What exactly is this substance and why is it so
valuable?
<p>
"Saffron--produced from the pollen of the saffron crocus--has been widely used throughout the Old World for its color, flavor, and
fragrance. It is native to the eastern Mediterranean region, and it has been cultivated in Mesopotamia, Persia, and northwest
India since antiquity. The earliest reference to saffron cultivation dates form 2300 B.C. Saffron was abundant in ancient days...
The use of saffron as a oinment likely originated in Persia and India...Saffron is difficult to grow and thereore reamins the most
expensive spice in the world...People past and present have prized saffron largely because of its color, ranging from deep gold to a 
reddish hue. Both red and gold achieved a high status in color symbolism...The prevalence of saffron in Greek myth attests to the
significance the early Greeks attributed to the plant...The Egyptians...assigned special powers to saffron, including the power to heal...
...Gold has traditionally symbolized enlightenment and wisdom, and thus Buddha is often depicted as golden in color. For this
reason, Buddhist priests may have used saffron to color their robes long before turmeric replaced it...Saffron remains the most 
expensive and most highly prized spice in the world today."<br>
---<i>Nectar and Ambrosia" An Encyclopeida of Food in World Mythology</i>, Tamra Andrews [ABC-CLIO:Santa Barbara CA] 2000 (p. 205-206)
<p>
"Saffron is perhaps native to Asia Minor. At any rate it was well known in the Aegean islands before the eruption of Santorini, which buried the
Minoan town of Akrotiri with its wall painting showing the picking of saffron. It was known to the poet of the Iliad, composed around
700 BC. And in Roman times the best saffron in the world grew in coastal Cicilia (south Asia Minor) at the Corycian cavern...In early Europe,
saffron was a dye and an aromatic. It coloured cloth either yellow or deep red, depending on its age. It was burnt in sacrifice for its
aroma, and it was used in a subtle...aromatic oil, crocinum, to be applied to the hair...The Romans combined its colouring and aromatic
effects in another special use: saffron was mixed with sweet wine and the resulting sticky yellow mixture was sprayed liberally about at theatres,
filling the air with costly fragrance. Grown in Iran from very ancient times, saffron reached Kashmir...no later than the third century AD
and possibly as early as the fifth century BC. It became a staple of the local enonomy...Westwards, saffron now grows in southern Spain,
which is where the hightest quality come from today."
<br>---<i>Dangerous Tastes: The Story of Spices</i>, Andrew Dalby [University of California Press:Berkeley] 2000 (p. 138-9)
<p>
"Native to the eastern Mediterranean, saffron was used in cooking for thousands of years before the Romans built their
empire. Indeed, some credit Phoenecian traders with introducing it in Spain--the county that today is the leading producer for
the commercial market. The word saffron comes from the Arabic word for 'yellow', and its distinctive color and taste grace
Spanish, Cuban, French, and Indian cuisines, especially their rice dishes."<br>
---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kiple & Ornelas [Cambridge University Press:Cambridge] 2000 volume 2 (p. 1846)
<p>
"The Romans used [saffron], but do not seem to have introduced it to Britain to any extent, and it was not
until the fourteenth century that it began to be frequently used there...At that time most saffron was imported, by the later Middle Ages a
home-grown saffron industry developed, with saffron plantations being established in Cambridgeshire and Essex (Saffron Walden takes its name
from the local saffron industry)...The word saffron comes from a Middle Eastern or Arabic language, but its exact source has never been
pinpointed. The furthest back its history can be traced it so Arabic sa'faran, which found its way to English via medieval Latin safranum and
Old French safran. Its use as a colour term, for 'orange-yellow', dates from the late fourteenth century."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 292-3)
<p>
"Saffron probably originated in Asia Minor and Greece; it was an important item for Phoenician traders. Cilicia was its most
abundant area of cultivation...Sicily also produced a good deal of it, but Mount Tobus in Phrygia was, in the general opinion,
the site which produced the best saffron of the ancient world...Murals in the ruins of the palace of Knossos on Crete, which probably
antedates the second millenium B.C., depict saffron harvesters at work. Home said that Zeus slept on a bed of saffron...We read
saffron in the writings of Hippocrates...Virgil...Pliny...and Matial, from which we gain the impression that the Greeks were the 
greatest appreciators of saffron in ancient times...Saffron grew wild in ancient Italy, but the Romans...preferred to buy
cultivated...saffron from Greece...Marco Polo did not rpeort encountering [saffron] in his [Far East] travels...Saffron is supposed to have entered
China when that country was invaded by the Mongols, who made considerable use of it in their cooking, which would mean the 
thirteenth century, but it does not seem to have been listed in any written document before the second half of the sixteenth
century...There is a tradition that France gained saffron directly from the Moors when they were stopped at Poitiers in 732 by Charles
Martel; it is not impossible, but if so, the Moors gave saffron to the the French more than two centuries before they grew it
in Spain themselves. Perhaps surer is a second tradition which says that saffron first entered France at Avignon at the end of the
fourteenth century..."<br>

<p>
<b>Why is saffron so expensive?</b><br>
"What makes saffron so expensive is the unavoidably large amount of hand labor necessary to produce a small amount of it. Saffron
is the dried stigmas, and usually part of the styles, of the flower or Crocus sativus, which have to be picked painstakingly
out of each blossom, flower by flower..."<br>

<b>"Too much" of a good thing? Devaluing saffron in Renaissance Europe:</b><br>
"Within Renaissance dietary literature, the shifting meaning of various foods can therefore be used as an indication of shifting
values and, in a sense, a measue of the evolution of self-image. Take, for example, the fate of saffron. In the early 
Renaissance, or period I, saffron
was a an ideal symbol of wealth, not only because it was difficult to harvest and expensive but it lent a dazzling effect to
foods. The way to impress a guest was to present saffron-daubed dishes sparkling like gold. Saffron became a symbol for 
gold...To the wealthy reader of culinary literature, eating saffron invests the body with wealth the same way a gold chain would, 
but here it is literally incorporated...The fact that period I dietaries consistently praised saffron reflects the fact that these
authors would primarily for courtly patrons...This enthusiasm for saffron abates during the sixteenth century among period 2 and 3
authors, and some even claim that it is dangerous. This is the effect...of increasing distance from wealthy patrons, but it can also
be linked to simple economic factors. Saffron was first cultivated on a large scale in the sixteenth century. It thus became
a more affordable luxury and consequently a less potent symbol of wealth...Ironically, as saffron was more widely used and as 
lower social ranks were increasingly able to imitate their superiors, courtly cookbooks included saffron less."<br>

<b>About Saffron Walden</b><br>
Saffron Walden is a town in England so named for its historic connection with growing saffron. Food historians generally agree the 
English saffron industry began in the 14th century. Notes here:
<p>
"England...has a double tradiiton concerning the first appearanc eof saffron. It was known tghere in the tenth century, for a 
pharmaceutical work of that period describes it; perhaps it was an import from Spain. Four centuries later, Hakluyt wrote that
saffron was first brought to England from Tripoli by a pilgrim who had hidden a stolen bulb in his hollow staff. However and whenever
saffron made its comeback, it took medieval Europe by storm. There were times and places when a pound of saffron would buy a horse.
...There were a number of saffron-growing areas in England, but one of them captured all the attention by adding the name of the
seasoning to its own--Saffron Walden, in Essex, where John Gerard wrote that saffron 'groweth plentifully...'. Saffron workers
there were called 'crokers,' a harking back to the ancient name for the plant. Started in the fourteenth century, the Saffron 
Walden industry petered out about 1770..."<br>
---<i>Food</i>, Waverly Root [Smithmark:New York] 1980 (p. 427-428)
<p>
The plant is said to have been introduced into England in the 14th century by a pilgrim who hid a corm in his hollow staff. Certainly, by the
sixteenth century the saffron crocus was being cultivated on a significant scale in England, particularly in Essex where the town of
Walden was renamed Saffron Walden. Use of saffron was especially noticeable in the west of England, and some believe that it had arrived there long
before the 14th century via the Phoenecians and their tin trade in Cornwall."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 680)
<p>
"Philip Miller gives a long careful account of saffron-growing in the 1720s between Saffron Walden and Cambridge. Growers had to 
fence their small parcels of gorund with hurdles to prevent hares feeding on the leaves in winter. In July, everyone was out planting the 192,040
roots that went to the acre, noting the size of each one and placing it accordingly for maximum yield, as it cost so much. The
crocus flowers were gathered early in the day, and the filaments or 'chives' picked out. Then came the trickly business of drying\
the saffron, which was ranged in wet 2 or 3 inch layers between sheets of white paper...a watchful care was needed to make sure
the precious filaments did not scorch. For all this labour, including free family labour, the grower might clear L5 a year...this was a poor return...
Saffron cake has hung on in Cornwall and Devonshire from the days when all cakes were raised with yeast rather than eggs or
baking powder..."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Sago</b></font><br>

"The early history of the sago palm use as a food is still unclear. Ethnologists and anthropologists have generally relied on native myths and legends to judge when it was 
introduced into the diets of many groups worldwide. Some...believe that sago palm has been utilized as a food source in the Pacific Islands since prehistorical days... 
Neolithic and Mesolithic artifacts found in insular Southeast Asia included tools used in sago preparation. Although this suggest that sago has been cultivated since 
ancient times, paleohistorians are not so sure...By most accounts, the sago palm was essential to the early inhabitants of Southeast Asia, and was probably one of the 
first plants they exploited as part of their subsistence strategy...people in freshwater areas were able to employ native palms in a variety of ways, including the production 
of starch, drugs, and fish poisons...According to the folk history of the Melanau of Sarawak, the tribe has 'always eaten sago,' even though they claim that rice, not sago, 
is their staple food. Sago, however, had been an important food source for peoples in other parts of the world. Evidence, although limited, indicates that during the 
Chinese Tang Dynasty (618-907), sago starch from palms grown in southeast China came to rival milled grain for use in
 making cakes..." <br>
---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kenneth F. Kiple & Kriemhild Conee Ornelas [Cambridge University Press:Cambridge] 2000, Volume One (p. 202) 
<p>
"Sago, or palm starch...comes from the pith of stems of various palms and cycads. Though produced in China's south today, it is far less important than in T'ang times, when... 
sago, consumed with milk, was a basic food, and when, in Canton, sago flour contended with cereal flour in preparing cakes...The arenga palm's primary center of 
genetic diversity may be the Malay Archipelago, and its secondary center India, with its domestication usually placed in the Southeast Asia/Pacific region...It was 
described by Chi Han in the fourth century A.d. as growing in what is northern Vietnam...and its cultivation in China today...is a northward extension of its 
Southeast Asian distribution. In addition to sugar and sago, our sources on China mention fermented toddy as an edible product the tree provides...One suspects that 
other edibles obtained from the arenga palm in Southeast Asia and India may also be consumed in China: fresh (as well as fermented) toddy, arrack, and vinegar from its 
juice; a vegetable from its 'cabbage'; and a preserve or snack from its seed...sago is ordinarily marketed in two processed forms as grains or as translucent globules called 
'pearl sago.' The grain, or inferior, form of sago, was imported to China in gunny sacks in the 1920's, whereas the latter, or superior, form was imported in boxes... 
Chinese merchants have long been active in the sago trade of Southeast Asia...nineteenth-century Chinese in Sumatra [are credited] with developing the process for making pearl 
sago, a product which holds is shape when cooked." <br>
---<i>Food in China: A Cultural and Historical Inquiry</i>, Frederick J. Simoons [CRC Press:Boca Raton FL] 1991 (p. 128-129) 
 <p>
"A source of meal that, in the vicinity of China, rivaled milled grain in making cakes was sago--although it always remained second to rice. This substance was yielded by 
several native plants an cycads, of which the most important was a sugar palm (kuang-lang; Arenga saccharifera), sometimes called gomuti or sagwire...it was 
commonly taken with water buffalo milk...The same tree yielded a sugar called jaggery and was the source of a wine called toddy. But the classical source of sago in 
Southeast Asia, and the one admired most for the light, delicate flavor of its yellow white meal, was the sago palm." <br>

<a name="salsify">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Salsify</b></font><br>
Salsify, also known as the Oyster Plant or Vegetable Oyster, is frequently mentioned in 19th century American cookbooks. This long, thin root vegetable
resembles a carrot in shape and a turnip in taste. There are several varieties and ways to approach this special edible
 gift in the kitchen. 
<p>
<b>Where did it originate?</b><br> 
"Wild salsify is native to the lands around the E. Mediterranean. It was probably eaten in classical times, but the earliest 
surviving mention of it is by Albertus Magnus in the 13th century. 
Cultivation began in Italy and France in the 16th century. In Britain the plant
 was grown first for its purple flower, attained a modest popularity as food in the 18th century, but relapsed into obscurity in the 
next. It has never been popular in the USA. Russia, France, and Italy are now the countries in which salsify is most grown
and eaten."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2nd edition, 2007 (p. 686)
<p>
<b>Why call it salsify?</b><br>
"There is much confusion over the terms salsify and scorzonera. Both apply to long thin white-flesh root vegetables of the daisy
family, but although strictly speaking, salsify is the name of the white-skinned variety and scorzonera is the name of the black-skinned
variety...Both were introduced to Britain towards the end of the seventeenth century, probably from France. They were originally
cultivated in Italy (the term salsify is of Italian origin), but there were also very popular from early times in Spain...The history
of the word salsify is no less confusing than its current usage. English got it from French salsifis, which in turn borrowed it from Italian, but
in what form? The modern Italian word is sassefrica, and one school of thought says that this came from the late saxifrica, literally
'rock-rubber'...According to this view, the change from sas- to sal- presumably took place in French...Others...claim that French
got salsifis from a now obsolete Italian form salsefica...It is not known where this came from, but it many have some connection 
with Latin sal, 'salt'. The salsify is sometimes known as the vegetable oyster."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 298)
<p>
<b>What is the oyster connection?</b><br>
Primary sources confirm 19th century cooks definately saw some kind of visual resemblance betwen cut salsify and oysters.
As time progressed, this connection became less evident. Mid-20th century gastronomists 
hypothesized that the plant might have tasted like an oyster in earlier times.
<p>
"Oyster plant...owes its name to its resemblance in flavor, when cooked, to that of an oyster."<br>
---<i>Grocer's Encyclopedia</i>, Artemas Ward [New York] 1911 (p. 446)
<p>
"Salsify...At one time called the oyster plant, why, one can hardly imagine, for it does not resemble the oyster in flavour. When
cut small and cooked, it was an oyster-like appearance, so it may have been more from appearance than favour that it 
gained its other name."<br>
---<i>Master Dictionary of Food & Cookery</i>, Henry Smith [Philosphical Library:New York] 1951 (p. 209)
<p>
"Salsify, Salsafy, Vegetable Oyster...A European vegetable which is much more popular on the Continent than in England or the USA.
Its long, thin, white roots, when boiled and tender, probably did possess a flavour not unlike that of an oyster, hence its English
name of Oyster Plant or Vegetable Oyster. If Salsify ever did possess such a flavour, it must have lost it, as Musk has lost its
scent."<br>

"Oyster plant is a vegetable the roots of which are boiled or stewed like carrots, or half-boiled, or gratd fine made into 
small flat balls and dipped into batter, and fried like oysters, which they strongly resemble. The young flower stalks, if cut in

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Salt</b></font><br>
Salt is a naturally occuring compound that is found in many places around the globe. Archaeologists and
food historians tell us salt was used at least as early as neolithic times. <a href="foodfaq2.html#iodizedsalt">Iodized salt</a>
was introduced in the early 19th century.
<p>
"Salt-winning--the deliberate production of salt--is known to have been practiced in the Neolithic era, but
the naturally occuring variety had probably been gathered tens of thousands of years before that, even in
only by coastal communities that, subsisting largely on shellfish, found other foods insipid without it.
However the taste originated, salt was to become a more powerful factor in the world economy than any
other food material apart from basic grains...Salts, in a generalized sense, have always been not only
stimulating to the taste buds by also biological necessities...Raw meat is the best provider; cooked meat
less so, because salt is usually lost in the cooking process. A diet based on cooked grain and vegetables
contains few natural salts, even less if the vegetables are cooked in unsalted water, since some of their
own salts are then leached out...By the first millennium BC it was an essential feature of the administration
of China, as it was for the Ptolemies of Egypt and the Seleucids of Persia."<br>
---<i>Food in History</i>, Reay Tannahill [Three Rivers Press:New York] 1988 (p. 179-180) 
<p>
"Historically, dietary salt (sodium chloride) has been obtained by numerous methods, including solar evaporation of seawater, the boiling down of water from brine
 springs, and the mining of 'rock' salt...'salt-making in history could be regarded as a quasi-agricultural occupation, as seen in frequent references to the annual 
production as a 'harvest...the quest for salt led to the development of major trade routes in the ancient world. The historian Herodutus...described caravans 
heading for the salt oases of Libya, and bread caravan routes also stretched across the Sahara, as salt from the desert was an important commodity exchanged for
 West African gold and slaves. Similarly huge salt deposits were mined in northern India before the time of Alexander the Great, and in the Pre-Columbian 
Americas, the Maya and Aztecs traded salt that was employed in food...In China, evidence of salt mining dates from as early as 2000 B.C. Homer termed salt
 'divine,' and Plato referred to it as 'a substance dear to the gods.' Aristotle wrote that many regarded brine or salt spring as a gift from the gods...The preservative
 properties of salt have maintained the essentiality of the mineral throughout history. It helped meat last over long journeys...During the eighteenth century, other 
industrial uses began to be found for salt. The invention in 1792 of a way to make sodium carbonate began the carbonated-water industry, and by 1850, 15 
percent of the salt in France was going into soda." <br>
---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kenneth F. Kiple and Kriemhild Conee Ornelas [Cambridge University Press:Cambridge] 2000, Volume One (p. 848) 
<p>
"Salt, sodium chloride (NaCl), is commonly said to be essential to life...Since prehistoric times much effort
has been devoted to obtaining salt for use with food. One main source is the existence of underground
deposits of salt, from which it can be mined. Examples are the famous salt quarries at Nantwich in
Cheshire, those at Luneburg in Germany, and many others in various parts of the world. The other great
source, which is inexaustible, is the sea (or other natrually occuring briny waters), which is made to yield
salt by a process of evaporation."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 687) 
<p>
"The salt mines of continental Europe encourged prehistoric peoples to settle down. The most famous
example is Hallstatt in the Austrian Salzkammergut, a name that speaks for itself and a very prosperous
place from the early period of the Bronze Age. Whenever Neolithic people settled down, abandoning
hunting in favour of agriculture and recuding the amount of meat in their very carniverous diet...it was a
great blessing to have a salt supply in the vicinity."<br>
---<i>History of Food</i>, Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat, translated by Anthea Bell [Barnes & Noble Books:New
York] 1992 (p. 461)<br>
<p>
"Chinese salt history begins with the mythical Huangdi, who invented writing, weaponry, and
transportation. According to the legends, he also had the distinction over presiding over the first war ever
fought over salt. One of the earliest verifiable saltworks in prehistoric China was in the northern province
of Shanxi. In this arid region of dry yellow earth and desert mountains is a lake of salty water, Lake
Yuncheng. This area was known for constant warfare, and all of the wars were over control of the lake.
Chinese historians are certain that by 6000 B.C., each year when the lake's waters evaporated in the
summer sun, people harvested the square crystals on the surface of the water, a system the Chinese
referred to as "dragging and gathering." ...The earliest written record of salt production in China dates to
around 800 B.C. And tells of production and trade of sea salt a millennium before, during the Xia dynasty." <br>

<b>Iodized salt</b><br>
The connection between iodine deficiency and goiter (overactive thyroid) was made in 4th Century China. 
French chemists, following Napoleon Buonaparte's orders, provided scientific evidence. They were the first to recommed
 iodized salt. The year? 1833. 
<a href="foodfaq2.html#usaiodizedsalt">Commercial iodized salt in the USA </a> was introduced in the 1920s.
<p>
<b>Iodine & goiter</b><br>
"Interest in and concern about the possibility of the control of goiter accelerated in the early nineteenth-century when Napoleon
Bonaparte ordered a systematic investigation of the disease. He did so because large numbers of young men from certain regtions
were being rejected as unfit for military duties. Moreover, Napoleon himself had probably seen something of the problem during
his march into Italy throug the goiter-invested Valais. Iodine was isolated from the ashes of the seaweed Fucus vesicularis by B.
Courtois in France in 1811, and in 1829 by Jean Francois Coindet recommended iodine preparations for the treatment of goiter. 
However, soon afterward marked oppoisition developed to its employment because of the occurance of symptons of toxicity, which we now
know was the result of excesssive thyroid secretion."<br>
---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kenneth F. Kiple & Kriemhild Conee Ornelas [Cambridge University Press:Cambridge]
2000, Volume One (p. 799)
<p>
"The World Health Organization and UNICEF urge salt producers to include iodine in their salt to prevent goiter, an
enlargment of the thyroid gland. Since everyone uses salt, it is an ideal distribution vehicle. They they claim the 1 billion 
pople worldwide are at risk of iodine deficiency...Iodine was used to cure goiter even before it was known to be iodine Humphrey
Davy...had suspected that iodine was an element, but it was Jean-Baptiste Dumas, the French chemist and founder of one of the
first schools of industry in France, who, in 1819, proved that iodine was present in natural sponge, which had been a 
standard treatment for goiter. In treating goiter...China was for centuries ahead of the West. A fourth-century-A.D. Chinese
physician, Ko Hung, prescribed an alcoholic extract from seaweed for goiter. Many seaweeds are rich in iodine, which is why the 
Japanese...have had relatively little experience with the disease...American salt is usually iodized. The British, having few
cases of goiter, do not iodize, and the French sometimes, but not always, iodize their salt."<br>
---<i>Salt: A World History</i>, Mark Kurlansky [Walker and Company:New York] 2002 (p. 384-386)
<p>
<a name="iodizedsdalt">
<b>Who suggested iodizing salt?</b><br>
"The iodination of salt was first suggested by Jean Baptiste Boussingault, who resided for many years in Colombia in South
America. The people among whom he lived obtained their salt from an abandoned mine and felt that this salt conferred special health
benefits. In 1825 Boussingault analayzed the salt and found that it contained large quantities of iodine. In 1833 he suggested that iodized
salt be used for the prevention of goiter. Unfortunately, an experminet carried out in France once more obscured the importance of
iodine in the etiology of the disease."<br>
---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i> (p. 799-800)
<p>
<a name="usaiodizedsalt">
<b>Iodized salt in the USA</b><br>
"Present-day practice in the prevention and control of goiter is based on the work of Dav id Marine, who in 1915 declared that
'endemic goitre is the easiest known disease to prevent.' Marine and his colleague, O. Kimball, carried out the first large-scale
trails with iodine in Akron, Ohio, from 1916 to 1920. About 4,500 girls between 11 and 18 years of age took part in the experiment...Mass
prophylaxis of goiter with iodized salt was first introduced in 1924 on a community scale in Michigan...By 1929 the average goiter
rate had fallen to 9 percent."<br>

<b>Origins & early uses</b><br>
"Sesame... one of the first oil-yielding plants to be taken into cultivation, in Egypt or the Near
East. Wild species, with one exception, are African...The name sesame is one of the few words to
have passed into modern languages from ancient Egyptian, in which it was sesemt...Sesame is
often mentioned by classical writers. The Greek authors Herodotus (5th century BC) and Strabo
(1st century BC) both mention its being cultivated in Babylonia...In the 1st century AD
Dioscorides mentioned the sprinkling of sesame seed on bread in Sicily, a practice which has
contintinued to the present day, e.g. on hamburger buns. Further east, sesame had long been
grown in Persia and India. It was probably introduced from Persia into China early in the
Christian era...In Africa the cultivation of sesame dates back to early times not only in Egypt and
Ethiopia but also further to the south and west...It was from West Africa that slave traders took
seeds to America...In Western and Central Europe sesame seeds are not much used except for
sprinking on bread and cakes, but at the eastern end of the Mediterranean it becomes more
common."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 713-4)
<p>
<b>India & Persia</b><br>
"Sesame, an oil plant apparently native to India and domesticated there probably in the second millennium BC. Historians used
to believe that sesame was the everyday oil of the ancient Near East, serving as food and medicine and as a base for perfumes. 
Ancient terms obviously connected with classical Greek sesamon...were tranlated 'sesame'. All is now in doubt because of the 
entire absence of archaeobotanical evidence for sesame in the ancient Near East before the end of the second millennium BC.
Pending earlier finds of sesame seeds, it is now often concluded that linseed was the common oil of ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt
and bore these names. On this assumption, whenever sesame was introduced from India, possibly shortly before 1000 BC, it will

"Sesame seeds which may be indigenous to West or Central Africa were groughto America by African slaves andhas impacted significantly
upon American Cookery, especially in South Carolina. Here in Carolina Low Country, the sesame seed, called benne in the Mandingo County
on the upper Niger River, was pounded into a paste and mixed with hominy, instinctively improving the amount of protein in their
diet. A substitute for peanuts, it was mixed with oysters to make a savory, creamy soup, or sprinkled over grilled chicken breast 
coated with cayenne and grape preserve. The American cook has found ingenious use of sesame seeds to not only improve the fragrance and 
flavor of their foods, but also to make candies, cookies, desserts, etc. The candies cookerd in the African Americans' home was most often

<b>Open Sesame! myths & legends</b><br>
"Sesame plays a large role in myth and ritual, particularly among the Hindus of India. Most likely, sesame originated in India, though
some scholars believe it originated in Africa. Sesame seeds are eaten as food and pressed to make oil, which is use both in 
cooking and for annointing. Both the seeds and the oil have ritual significance. Hindus make cakes of the seeds and offer them to spirits
of the dead. They annoint themselves with oil to bring good luck and to keep evil away. Since antiquity, Hindus have linked sesame
with death. For this reason they have traditionally used sesame seeds both in ceremonies for the dead and in ceremonies conducted to counteract
the influence of demonic forces...The ancient mythological connections are numerous and widespread. In Hindu myth, Yama, the god of the dead,
created sesame, so the people offer both the seeds and the oil to him...Hindus also use sesame seeds in funeral rites for the
newly deceased...believing that sesame will offer them protection against evil...Hindus who offer sesame to the living belive that this
sacred grain helps remove the contagion of death...There is now doubt that people past and present assigned sesame magical properties.
Perhaps the most telling measure of sesame's reputed magic the world over is the effect the phrase 'Open Sesame!' had for Ali 
Baba in <i>The Arabian Nights</i> iand in various European folktales. The utterance of these words not only opened doors but also secret
passages in trees and mountain caves. The power of these words stemmed from the ancient belief that certain plants contained magic
and that sesame was one such plant."<br>

<a name="taro">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Taro</b></font><br>
"Taro...The family has a bewildering range of names. Other common names for the principal
kind of taro are colocasia, which has also become the botanical name, and the corresponding
Arabi name qulqas, old cocyam, a name used in Africa to distinguish it from new cocyam..Taro
originated in India or SE Asia, and may have been first cultivated as early as
5000BC...Cultivation of taro spread eastwards to China (berfore 100 BC) and Japan; and also
westward, arriving in Egypt around 100 BC. There it came to the notice of the Latin writer Pliny,
who called it  the arum of the Egyptians'; and it also picked up the Greek name kolokasia, which
had formerly been used for a lotus root. Cultivation spread through Africa, and by the early
centuries of the Christian era the plant was a staple crop in W. Africa...The introduction of taro to
the Pacific islands had major results for the diet there, since it rapidly became a staple of the
region. It is especially important in Hawaii, where the prevailing creation myth states that taro
was the first-born of Father Sky and Daughter Earth, humans coming next. Traditionally, the
cultivation of taro in Hawaii has been men's work and its sacred character was such that women
were not supposed to touch the plants. Indeed the most commonly produced red variety was in
former times reserved exclusively for use by the chiefs...The roots of wild plants are tnerally
unpleasantly acrid in flavour on account ot the presence of crystals of calcium oxolate, which are
clustered particularly thickly under the skin. Selection, even in very early times, of the least acrid
plants has led to modern cultivated strains, some of which are mild enough to eat raw. However,
the calcium oxolate problem can be overcome by peeling and cooking. When properly prepared,
taro has a light, mealy texture like a delicate, floury potato. The flavour is pleasant, light without
being insipid, sometimes slightly sweet."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 783-4)
<p>
"Taro refers to four members of the Aracae family...The last [Colocasia esculenta, true taro] is
the most widely distributed, and in many places in Oceania, it was the favored staple. Ancient
Hawaiians, perhaps Oceania's most sophisticated agriculturalists, recognized between 150 and
175 distinguishable varieties of taro...Taro was the main staple of the Hawaiians and Samoans.
Colocasia taro is believed to have been one of the first root crops to be
domesticated...Traditionally, it was found from South Asia through Indonesia to the Pacific.
Recent evidence suggests widely distributed multiple sites being highland Papau New
Guinea...Polynesian taro, however, had its origins in Indonesia, although New Guinea may have
been the immediate area of domestication."<br>

University Press:Cambridge] 2000, Volume Two (p. 1353-4)
<p>
"Colocassi is a Cypriot version of the taro, a tropical and temperate plant with large starchy
edible tubers. In the case of the colocassi, the tubers are comparatively elongated and slender,
with a characteristic stalk-like stump, so that they rather resemble an unfamiliar but suspicious
species of tall mushroom. Their name is an alteration of colocasia, the Latin genus name of the
taro; this in turn came from Greek lolokasia, a term originally applied ot the edible root of the
Egyptian water-lily."<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 86)
<p>
"...the Hawaiians subsisted primarly on taro, its swollen, fleshy corm providing their daily staple.
Where taro originally came form is a matter of conjecture, but ethnobotanists suggest that it was
first cultivated in India or in Southeast Asia. From there it spread west and east: west to Africa
and on to the Caribbean and Latin America with the slave trade; east to China, Japan, and the
Polynesian islands, eventually ending up in its most remote location--Hawaii. And nowhere in
the world did a people come to depend so heavily on taro as did the Hawaiians....So it is not
surprising that the Hawaiians gave taro a prominent place in their creation stories. According to
one version, the sky principle, Wakea, mated with the earth principle, Papa, to produce two
offspring: from the body of the first, which died, sprang the taro plant; form the second came the
human race. The very word for the family in Hawaiian--ohana--is derived from the word for the
cormlets--oha--that branch out drom the swollen subterranean stem--the corm--of the plant...In
the past, taro was baked in an imu until tender; in recent times, a cleaned, 5-gallon kerosene can
eased the job considerably. As soon as the taro was cool, it was peeled. Then it was set on a
large, slightly hollowed board about 3 feet long. The man who was to pound the poi sat with his
legs straddling the board and pounded it with a stone mallet...From time to time, the man dipped
the tips of his fingers into a bowl of water and shook them over the mass of taro, all the while
constantly turning it. When the pounded taro was still solid, he stopped. This paiai kept well and
was light enoguth to be carried to other locations."<br>
---<i>The Food of Paradise</i>, Rachel Laudan [University of Hawai'i Press:Honolulu] 1996 (p. 217-9)
<p>
"Taro corms are roasted, boiled, or baked, and may be made into cakes. Heating is necessary to
remove an acrid, irritating property of the raw corm. Traditionally, the substance blamed for this
irritation has been the needle-like crystals of calcium oxalate, which occur throughout the plant
and become lodged in the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat. Dumbcane
(Dieffenbachia), a household plant, is considered a dangerous poison for the same reason. Now
other researchers suspect that one or more additional chemicals may be responsible for the
acridity and intense itching and burning of raw taro, which would be injected into mucous
membranes by the sharp-tipped calcium oxalate crystals. In the Hawaiian Islands, taro plant is
eaten after thoroughly boiled to destroy the toxins; the leaf (luau, also the name of the feast using
taro leaves) must be boiled at least 45 minutes over low heat, whereas corms are boiled in a deep
pot with salted water for at least an hour or until soft."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Timbale</b></font><br>

Defining the term "timbale" is a complicated exercise in culinary context. Ingredients, method, purpose, and presentation are period and place dependent. In the
 most basic sense, timbales are fancy molded compositions combining an outer layer of starch (grain, pasta, rice) with fillings (meat, vegetable, fruit). Some are 
layered (similar to contemporary lasagne); others are vertical presentations (similar to vol-au-vent). Timbales can be savory or sweet and served at almost any 
course. The ultimate flexible food application. 
<p>
<b>English/Anglo meaning</b><br>
According to the [online] <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> the word timbale, in the culinary sense, appeared in in English print in1842:
"2. Cookery. A dish made of finely minced meat, fish, or other ingredients, cooked in a crust of paste or in a mould: so called from its shape. 1824 BYRON Juan
 XV. lxvi. 38 Then there was God knows what ‘à l'Allemande’,..‘timballe’, and ‘Salpicon’. 1866 MRS. GASKELL Wives & Dau. I. xv. 178 Mr. Gibson had to
 satisfy his healthy English appetite on badly-made omelettes, rissoles, vol-au-vents, croquets, and timbales. 1880 ‘OUIDA’ Moths I. 25 Eating her last morsel of a
 truffled timbale. 1899 Westm. Gaz. 16 Sept. 1/3 ‘If I could only have a little sweetbread timbale’, she said longingly. 1908 Daily Chron. 10 Apr. 7/5 Chicken 
Timbales with Sauce." 
<p>
<b>Italian applications</b><br>
"Timballo is a tall cylindrical container, timbale in French, and gives its name to any dish cooked in it, usually enclosed in a pastry or pasta lining, which is then 
unmoulded. The contents can be short or stuffed pasta in a rich sauce, sometimes a besciamella, with the addition of many delicacies like truffles, sweetbreads,
 artichoke bottoms. This is also called a pasticcio..."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Italian Food</i>, Gillian Riley [Oxford Univeristy Press:New York] 2007 (p. 528) 
<p>
"Timballo. Timbale. A dish, often with pasta or rice, made in a form and unmolded. Timballini are small molds. From the Arabic at-tabl (the drum). The most famous
 timballo is the Sicilian timballo di anellini, made with ring-shape dried pasta, balsamello, ground beef and chicken, peas, and vegetables, all wrapped in lettuce
 leaves and baked in a mold. Timballo di crespelle is crepes layered with spinach, ground meat, giblets, mozzarella, and parmigiano, from Abruzzo."<br>

<p>
"...Lampedusa's timballo is perhaps the summa of an ancient tradition rather than the product of a single recipe. It is curiously reminiscent of the patina apiciana from
 classical Rome, in which layers of laganum, an early version of lasagna, alternate with layers of chicken, fish, or songbirds. The sugar and the cinnamon recall the
 timbales and the torta described in fourteenth-century Tuscan cookbooks; the ham and truffles sound a note of nineteenth-century France. Its presence on a
 princely table in the middle of the nineteenth century, albeit as a provincial alternative to consomme, speaks volumes about the evolution of the Sicilian 'baronial 
cuisine'."<br>---<i>ibid</i> (p. 182)

 meat-and-tomato sauce, and nutmeg..."---<i>ibid</i> (p. 532) 
<p>
"There are homemade dishes, but for holidays and other festive occasions the family may resort to store-bought macaroni, the nearest baker's oven and perhaps 
even to a professional cook for a mess of maccheroni al forno, oven-baked macaroni, for which the pasta is combined with buffalo cheese, sausage and meat balls
 into a sort of pie. This is a festive dish in all three of the southern-most provinces, sometimes under the alternative 
name of timballo di maccheroni."---<i>ibid</i> (p. 554) 
<p>
<b>French interpretations</b><br>
"A timbale can be composed of meat, fish, or vegetables in a creamy sauce, or of fruit in Chantilly cream, but its essence is in its shape, which is that of a cup or 
bowl (the original meaning of timbale in French is 'kettledrum'). The 'case' enclosing a timbale's contents is usually made of pastry, but rice or pasta are also used.
 Timbales are part of classic French cuisine, and there are numerous specialized recipes...by the end of the nineteenth century it was firmly in place on the best 
Victorian and Edwardian tables."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 343-344) 
<p>
"Timbale. By definition this word (which comes from Arab thabal meaning drum) means a small metal receptacle, round in shape and mostly intended to hold a 
beverage. Timbales of this kind are chiefly made of silver, sometimes of gold, or sometimes of silver plate, and are of many kinds. Some are simple; others are ornamented.
The word timbale, which in the early days was only applied to individual drinking cups, has taken on a much wider meaning, and is used to describe all sorts of bowls,
of metal, earthenware and china, larger than those that our fathers used at table, which were of a size to sere two guests together ...These timbales of the new type were used
chiefly to serve vegetables and food in sauce. In French culinary parlance today the same word is still used in the phrase dresser en timbale to describe the serving of
some preparation in a large bowl, which may be a vegetable dish or leguimier, although used for many other foodstuffs than vegtables. Thus in these timbales-legumiers are served scrambled
eggs, food in sauce, purees, custards and othe prepartions, all to some extent liquid. Dresser en timbale in modern culinary parlance often means to heap the food on a
platter in a pyramid shape, usually garnished. Culinarily the word timbale means a preparation of an kind cooked or served in a pie crust. Timbapes of this kind are simply a
sort of hot pie, which instead of being made in a special mould or dish, usualy inged, are made in plain round mould with high sides. These moulds are sometimes
embellished...their sides are...decorated with motifs or [sic] different kinds. These timbales are filled before cooking with forcemat and meats of various
sorts...Ther eare many...kinds of timbale which are not filled until after the crust has been cooked...To meet the needs of the ordinary housewife, timbale cases are made
in fireproof porcelain in the same shape and colour as the real pie-crusts. But the true gourmand, is not satisfied with a timbale whos crust is not edible; when served
with a real timbale, this gourmand enjoys not only the contents but the container too."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Tracklements</b></font><br>
Food historians define "tracklements" as a variety of traditional British condiments accompanying meat. They trace the 
genesis of this term to Dorothy Hartley's <a href="tracklements.pdf"><i>Food in England</i></a> [1954]. Tracklements brand condiments were introduced in
 the 1970s. 
<p>
"Tracklements is a cover term for a wide range of condiments that go with meat--mustards...relishes, pickled greengages, apple jelly spiked with rosemary, rowan
jelly suffused with port wine--the sort of items, in fact, that in the latter part of the twentieth century became widely avaialble in samll
nostalgic jars at large prices. The English food-writer Dorothy Hartley claimed to have invented the word, or rather its culinary
application. According to her she was reviving an old term for 'impedimenta' in general. However, no trace of such a word has been found before she first used it in the 
early 1950s, and its origins remain a mystery. One possibility is that Latin tragmata or Greek tragmata, 'spices, condiments' may have been present at its
birth."<br>

been found.

"Tracklements began in 1970 when, having read John Evelyn's Diaries, William Tullberg started to make the first English wholegrain mustard 
How It Started" 
The first trial saw the mustard seed being put through a coffee grinder, before it was discovered that an old industrial coffee mill could be adapted to grind the mustard seed correctly. After the first small batches of Urchfont Mustard were made for friends and for Saturday morning sausage and mash parties, William started to make mustards full time. "I remembered my Lincolnshire grandmother using the word "tracklements" for meat accompaniments and it seemed such an appropriate name that we named the company "Wiltshire Tracklements". Tracklements has continued to grow steadily over the years with William's son, Guy, taking over the reins and the product range expanding to incorporate over 60 products; relishes, chutneys, sauces, jellies, ketchups, pickles, mayonnaise, salsas and fruit cheeses. 
Along the way, Tracklements has outgrown several premises, eventually moving, in July 2007, to a new unit just a few miles from the original bakery in Sherston.

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Trail mix & gorp</b></font><br>
The history of trail mix and and gorp-type foods (nutritious, high-energy snacks composed
variously of nuts, seeds, dried meats, dried fruits & berries and candy) begins with ancient
nomads. These people were experts (they had to be!) at creating portable high-energy snacks that
withstood weather and did not require cooking. The practice of drying food for preservation
purposes was practiced by many ancient cultures and cuisines, and these foods were relatively
easy to obtain. 
<p>
As time marched on, so did the trail mix. Ancient travelers, explorers, pioneers, hunters, soldiers,
hikers, scouts--anyone needing a lightweight carboload-- have enjoyed some version of this
portable treat.  Native Americans ate trail mix foods, too. They taught the Voyageurs how to
make <a href="http://www.whiteoak.org/learning/food.htm">pemmican</a>.
<p>
Food historians generally place first the commercially manufactured products called trail mix/gorp
in California, 1968. This makes sense, given the plentify availability of locally dried fruits (raisins,
dates, etc.) and California's reputation for marketing natural foods. Today's American trail mix
and gorp typically do not
contain meat products. The recipes range from home-made favorites to pricey gourmet
pre-packaged items. They can be as healthy or sodium filled/fat-laden as any other food. It all
depends upon the ingredients. 
<p>

"Vanilla...of the great number of orchid family members, Vanilla planifolia...is one of the few to be prized for something other than its flowers. The vanilla bean is the 
pod fruit of this climbing orchid, which is native to that part of the New World that also gave chocolate to the whole world...However, it was not the Aztecs who
 first discovered the secret of vanilla, which was one of nature's better-guarded secrets that neither the vanilla flower nor its fruit have a telltale aroma that might have
 demanded further investigation. Rather, it was the Totonacs, in what has become the Mexican state of Vera Cruz, who discoverd at least 1,000 years ago that if the
 initially tasteless beans were "sweated" in the sun for two or three weeks, and then slowly dried for several months, this process would force the development of
 vanillin, the major flavor componnent of the beans. It is interested  to note that although the Totonacs were subsequently conquered by the Aztecs, they in turn 
joined forces with the newly arrived Spaniards to overturn the Aztec empire. And this meant that they continued to have a monopoly on vanilla."<br>

“The indigenous tribes of Mexico were harvesting vanilla pods as early as 6000 B.C. and using them primarily to flavor their chocolate drinks...They also ground 
up vanilla flowers and wore them around their necks as amulets and medicinal charms. They used vanilla as a perfume, a medicine, a mental stimulant, an insect 
repellant, and an aprhodisiac...By creating the goddess Xanath, the Totonacs revealed their belief that the gods themselves gave the people vanilla. According to 
myth, the heavenly vanilla vine continued to bloom and produce fruit on earth to supply not only Xanath’s warrior but all of the Totonacs with eternal happiness. 
Having received this heavenly gift, the people made it their duty to care for the vines, to guard them against theft, and to learn how to increase their productivity, 
which they did by performing what was called a ‘marriage of vanilla.’”<br>

<b>Vanilla in Europe</b><br>
"In its original Central American home vanilla was used by the Aztecs to flavour chocolate, and the first writers in English to mention it when it had crossed the 
Atlantic with the Spanish describe the process; the natualist John Ray, for instance in 1673: 'vanillas which they mingle with Cacao to make Chocolate'. It fact, when 
chocolate was first introduced to Europe in the sixteenth century, it was cinnamon that was usually used to flavour it, at is was not until the eighteenth century that 
vanilla toook over a role it has never held since. But it is as and ingredient of ice cream that vanilla really come into its own: it appears to have been popularized in
 the USA in the latter part of the nineteenth century...and by the early twentieth century it had established itself as the standard flavouring...The Spanish were 
responsible not only for importing the vanilla pod to Europe, but also for supplying Europe's languages with a name for it. In Spanish it is vainilla, a diminutive of
 vaina, 'sheath'--a reference to the long narrow pods."<br>

"Vanilla...is one of the few tropical spices indigenous ot the New World, and  one of the most popular flavourings worldwide for confectionery and other sweet 
foods...Vanilla was first used by the Aztecs and its use recorded by the Spanish. Diaz noticed Montezuma drinking tlilxochitl, a drink made from cacao beans
 flavoured with vanilla...In the second half of the 16th century, the Spaniards imported vanilla beans into Spain and made chocolate flavoured with the spice. Hugh 
Morgan, apothecary to Elizabeth I, suggested vanilla as a flavouring in its won right and gave some cured beans to the Flemish botanist Clusius who described them
 in his Exoticorum Libri Decem (1605). Plants were taken to Reunion in 1822 by the French, then to Mauritus in 1827 and to Madagascar in about 1840. But 
pollination of the vanilla vine is mysterious and only occurs unaided in Mexico--even there only a small percentage of the fruits set naturally. So it was not until 
Albius, a former slave in Reunion, developled a practical method of pollinating vanilla artificially that commercial cultivation of vanilla became possible. Madagascar, 
together with the Comor Islands and Reunion, now produces about 80 per cent of the world output of the variety of V. planifolia known as Bourbon vanilla...Much
 of the vanilla entering western markets is used for its preparation of vanilla extract, a hydroalcoholic solution which contains the extracted aroma and flavour of
 vanilla...Vanillin, the chief flavouring principle, has been the subject of much attention from flavour chemists. The first synthetic vanillin was produced by German 
chemists in 1874 was coniferin...Synthetic vanillin can also be produced from other sources such as coal tar extracts...European take-up of vanilla was long 
restricted to a flavour enhancer for chocolate and tobacco although there was early use of it in puddings...Also, its rarity meant it soon entered the pharmacy,

“There are about a hundred species of the genus Vanilla, all tropical vining orchids...The French were certainly involved in the expansion of vanilla cultivation. There
 were French colonists in the state of Veracruz in Mexico in the eighteenth century, growing vanilla. The first commercial plantations were there, on vanilla’s native
 territory, but they suffered from the inadequacy of the natural pollinators until a series of experiments on greenhouse plants in the Old World showed how to do it
 better than the bees. The French colonists had to share the technique, derived by Charles Morren in Liege Belgium in 1836, with the neighboring Totonac Indians,
 who also raised vanilla, because the Totoancs, seeing the vastly increased crops of the French, accused them of thievery. In 1841 a former slave, Edmond Albius, 
on the island of Reunion, in the Indian Ocean, discovered an even quicker and easier method of pollinating the flowers. This raised the productivity...by a factor of 
five and encouraged the French to expand vanilla cultivation on their tropical island possessions.”<br>

century Americans developed a passion for vanilla, especially as an ice-cream flavoring (by 1932 it as estimated that 75-80 percent of all ice cream was vanilla) and
 today America uses more vanilla than any other country. Vanilla extract (or "vanilla essence") created by Joseph Burnett in 1847, was made by soaking vanilla

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Vinegar</b></font><br>
The history of vinegar is connected with that of wine. Ancient peoples of many cultures
and cuisines appreciated vinegar for its preservative qualities and medicinal attributes. 
According to the food historians, commercial (large-scale) production began in France
during the 16th century. Why? Changing tastes prefered this new flavor over traditional
salt preservation. The <a href="foodfaq2.html#frenchvinegar">French</a> were quick to recognize and capitalize on the growing
demands of this new market. Italians countered with <a href="foodfaq2.html#balsamicvinegar">basalmic vinegar</a>. By the <a href="foodfaq2.html#vinegar19th">19th century</a>, vinegar was employed for
culinary, medicinal, household and personal uses.
<p>
<b>How old is vinegar?</b><br>
"Vinegar has been in use for thousands of years and its origins are untraceable. One of
the earliest references is from the 5th century BC, where Hippocrates recommended its
medicinal powers. However, then as now, its main use has beeen as a flavoring and
preserving agent. There was no need to invent vinegar as it makes itself without
difficulties."<br>

<b>Vinegar in the Ancient world</b><br>
"Vinegar merely as a condiment was not important, but ut was a very necessary part of
food preservation;  vinegar and hard brine', says Columella,  are essential for making
preserves'. In addition, it was commonly used as a drink when diluted with water. This
diltuion meant that a small abount of vinegar would go much furhter han the same
amount of wine, so it proved to be useful and refreshing drink to take on long journeys
where baggage had to be kept to a minimum. It is not surprising therefore that it figured
among the rations of the Roman soldiers when on the march. Vinegar was usually
manufactured from flat wine and various crushed ingredients such as yeast, dried figs,
salt and hone added. It could also be made from other fruits such as peaches, and
squill vinegar is also mentioned."<br>

"Vinegar, product of a secondary fermentation of wine (or other alcohol). In the ancient
Mediterranean vinegar was practically always made from wine, hence the epic epithet
<i>oininon oxos</i>  winy vinegar' employed by Archestratus. Although by no means as
desirable as fine wine, vinegar has important food uses and has been purposefully
made ever since ancient times: instructions are given by Columella. Vinegar is most
often used as a culinary ingredient and as a preservative. Numerous medicinal uses
are listed by ancient physicians. A vinegar and water mixture, known in Greek as
oxykraton, was also used medicinally. A very similar mixture, flavoured with herbs,
formed a popular cheap drink...Vinegar is Greek oxos, Latin acetum. These terms are
often used metaphorically for  bad wine' in comic contexts..."<br>

"Vinegar (the French word, vinaigre, literally means  sour wine') has been produced
and used since the Gallo-Roman era; vinegar diluted with water was a common drink of
the Roman legionaires. Orleans, an important centre for wine transport on the Loire,
soon became the vinegar capital, and hald the French wine vinegar is still produced
there. The vinegar merchants' corporation was created in this city in 1394, and in 1580
Henri IV ordered that the profession of vinegar and mustard merchant should be a
 recognized occupation in the town and its suburbs', which resulted in the perfection of
carefully developed production methods."<br>

table vinegars used in France today are of grape origin; in the United Kingdom (malt),
and in the United States (apples)."<br>

<b>Wine vinegar</b><br>
"Vinegar production must have started in ancient times as the natural result of
exposure of wine and beer to the atmosphere when uses for soured wine would
naturally have developed. The traditional technique for making vinegar is called the
Orleans process and involves only partially filling barrels with wine and leaving it there,
under the influence of desirable acetobacter, for several months."<br>

"The best wine vinegar may be made from either white or red wine, the latter having an agreeable
mellow taste. Sherry also yields a particularly well-rounded flavour. Wine vinegars of the finest
quality are made by a simple and ancient methood known as the Orleans process. Thsi requires
the maker not to be in a hurry (the process takes months); to use small barrels (from which the
heat engendered by fermentation dissipates quickly); to use wine of good quality; and to provide
access to the barrels for air (which will contain acetobacytes, bacteria naturally present in the
atmosphere). When the vinegar has developed the required acidity some of it is drawn off and
more wine added. This sequence can be repeated for an indefinitely long period."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 828)
<p>
"At the turn of the century, this city [Orleans, France] was home to more than 200 vinegar
producers. Now there is only one, Martin Pouret, a company that refuses to abandon traditional
methods. It is run by Jean Francois Martin, who grew up next to the plant in a house built by his
great-grandfather Emile Pouret in 1870. It is on the bustling Faubourg Bannier, which once ran
through countryside but is now lined with row houses and shops.  Mr. Martin's grandmother
Jeanne Pouret was the last of the Pourets, who founded the company in 1797. The name became
Martin Pouret when she married Robert Martin after World War I. It was the location of Orleans
as the Loire River port closest to Paris - it is about 70 miles south-southwest of the capital - that
led to its vinegar production in the Middle Ages. The Loire flows from near Lyons in the heart of
the country to Brittany on the Atlantic. Goods, especially wine, were shipped on the river from
Bordeaux, Burgundy and the Loire Valley, then unloaded in Orleans for the trip to Paris. Canals
linked the Loire to Burgundy and the Rhone and ultimately to the Mediterranean.
     Wine that spoiled on the trip was left at Orleans, and instead of discarding it, the Orleanais
made it into vinegar. A vinegar merchants' corporation was founded in 1394; production methods
had been defined by 1580. An explanation of the process was eventually provided by Louis
Pasteur, who discovered that the fermentation of wine into vinegar was caused by a bacterium.
     ''With the coming of the railroad by the turn of the century the importance of Orleans as a
commercial center began to decline,'' Jean Francois Martin said. Silting also interfered with
navigation. After World War II, small vinegar companies gradually began closing, forced out of
business by makers using high-speed industrial methods. It takes three weeks for wine to develop
into vinegar by the traditional Orleans method. It is then aged in oak for six months. The
industrial methods used to produce most vinegar can convert 30,000 liters of wine into vinegar in
24 hours. Unlike the industrial method, the Orleans process does not require heating, thus
preserving more flavor of the wine. ''We want to capture the quality of the wine,'' Mr. Martin
said. ''That's how the vinegar acquires its pedigree.'' In the Martin Pouret plant two dim rooms
contain about 3,000 barrels, called vaisseaux, stacked in rows equally divided between red and
white wine vinegar. Each barrel is only three-quarters full, because oxygen is needed for the
bacteria to act. In a three-week cycle, a third of the vinegar in a barrel is drawn off and an equal
amount of new wine is added. As the alcohol in the new wine is converted into acetic acid, the
flavor is enhanced by the vinegar that was already in the barrel. ''We do not have to add new
bacteria, but we watch carefully and take samples to make sure the fermentation is consistent,''
Mr. Martin said. After three weeks no further beneficial fermentation takes place, he said. ''When
people make vinegar at home with what they call a 'mother,' '' Mr. Martin said, ''they do not
control the timing of the fermentation. These people are making spoiled wine, not good vinegar.''
After three weeks, vinegar is transferred to oak casks for aging and is filtered after six months.
Flavorings are added just before bottling."<br>

"Vinegar, Wine, French Method of Making.</b><br>
The following is the French method of making vinegar. The wine destined for vinegar is mixed
in a large tun with a quantity of wine lees, and the whole being transferred into cloth sacks placed
within a large iron-bound vat, the liquid matter is forced through the sacks by superincumbent
pressure. What passes through is put into large casks set upright, having a small apurture in their
top. In these it is exposed to the heat of the sun in summer, or to that of a stove in winter.
Fermentation supervenes in a few days. If the heat should rise too high, it is lowered by cool air
and the addition of fresh wine. In the skilfull regulation of the fermentative temperature chiefly
consists the art of making good wine vinegar. In summer the process is generally complete in a
fortnight, in winter double the time is requisite. The vinegar is then run off into the barrels, which
contains several chips of birchwood. In about a fortnight it is found to be clarified, and is then fit
for the market. It mus be kept in close casks."<br>

expensive and was given as gifts among families, particularly among the nobility, who believed it could
ward off the plague. Mere drops would be used to add flavor to a sauce or to dress fruit. Only in the last
decade has balsamico become a popular item in the kitchen--ironically, only after American entrepreneur
Chuck Williams brought some from Modena for sale at his Williams-Sonoma kitchen specialty store in San

"Vinegar.--One of the most useful and frequently needed articles in the long catalogue of domestic wants, and yet but seldom to be 
obtained--the ordinary article sold being a diluted and impure solution of acetic acid. Acetic acid is the most common of the vegetable 
acids, occurring in the juices of a large number of plants. Vinegar in the United States is made chiefly from cider, although 
whiskey and other alcoholic liquors are brought into service; and even the refuse maple-sap, too poor for sugar, is boiled down, diluted and 
made into vinegar. The flavor and quality of the vinegar depends entirely upon the material of which it is made, and the 
quality and condition of that material--thus wine vinegar is the color of the wine producing it. Of all the sources for the 
production of vinegar, cider made from sound, ripe, sweet apples by a good process, and without adulterations, is undoubtedly the most 
the most agreeable and serviceable description in use. From the high price of acetic acid, vinegar is frequently adulterated with 
sulphuric, muriatic or nitric acids, and, in some cases, there is not a trace of acetic acid to be found, the flavor being given 
by the addition of ether, alum, red pepper, mustard, etc., these adulterations being exceedingly injurious to the delicate 
organism of the stomach." <br>

"Watercress...a useful perennial plant with a long season, which in some regions extends right through the 
year...Watercress shares membership with mustard, and both plants owe their pungency to substances of the same 
kind. Watercress grows wild in Europe and Asia, and also in America since its introduction by European 
immigrants. Wild watercresses have been continuously popular since ancient times, not only for their pleasantly 
biting taste, but also for a wide variety of supposed health-giving properties. Thus the Greek general Xenophon made 
his soldiers eat it as a tonic." <br>

"It is recorded that the Romans ate water-cress with vinegar to ad the cure of mental complaints, and it was certainly eaten, if 
not cultivated, before their time. Garden cress has a long history of cultivation, which is hardly surprising as it is so easy to 
grow. Its origins are thought to be in Persia; it is listed among Assyrian plants and Dioscorides states that it came from 
Babylon. It spread through Syria to Greece and to Egypt, where ancient cress seeds have been found. Cultivated in Greek gardens at the time 
of Theophrastus, it is also briefly mentioned by Pliny." <br>

"The wheat now growing in vast fields stretching across the Great Plains of North America had its beginnings in the eastern
Mediterranean region, where the wild grass Triticum aestivum originated to become one of the first of the domesticaed grains
and ultimately one of the world's two most important superfoods. Wheat was probably first domesticated in the Middle East many
thousands of years ago. The ancient Egyptians made bread from it, but only later did the Greeks adopt wheat in preference
to emmer. Later still, one of the reasons for the expansion of Rome was the need for wheat, and thej Romans turned Egypt
into a wheat-growing breadbasket for their empire. Wheat reached northern China later than it reached the West, and in eastern
Asia it jouned millet as a major crop."<br>

they received other cultivated plants from gods, animate spirits, heroic ancestors, or the earth itself...Domesticated wheats
belong to at least three different species...and hundreds of distinct varieties...All domesticated wheat has lost the
physical and genetic characteristics that would allow itself aggressively to reseed and sprout by itself...Although humans domesticated
wheat, one may argue that dependence on wheat also domesticated humans. The switch from gathering food to producing food, dubbed the
"Neolithic Revolution"...ultimately and fundamentally altered human development. Both wheat and barley, destined to feed the 
great civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome, originated in the Near East, the earliest cradle of Western

"Wheat, in this article, means club wheat, durum waet and bread wheat (see separate entries from Einkorn; Emmer; Spelt). These are
'naked' or free-threshing wheats, not requiring to be parched before threshing and therefore demanding less time and trouble
in preparation than emmer. Club wheat developed from emmer in cultivation. The earliest evidence for it comes in Syria and 
Turkey, not long after 8000 BC. It spread very rapidly in cultivation, as far east as Baluchistan by 6000 BC, and as far west
as southern France by 5500. In western Europe, emmer and einkorn arrived on the scene later than club wheat. There is little evidence
of club wheat in Pharaonic Egypt. Turning to Greece, club wheat was being grown in Crete and in Thessaly soon after 6000 BC. At
some time in the later prehistoric period durum wheat begins to be distinguishable as a separate variety or group of varieties.
Bread wheat is a new species that arose in cultivation. its appearance on the scene is much later than that of club wheat: it 
seems to have originated in northwestern  Iran, not far south from the Caspian, in the late second millennium BC. Wheat was the
preferred staple food of the classical world; club wheat and durum wheat for flat cakes, flat breads and eventually for 
pasta; bread wheat for raised bread. The two obvious alternative cereals, barley and emmer, were suitable for some types of
cakes and biscutis, and made a better basis for broths and gruels than does wheat, but they were little use for bread."<br>

life, people considered it a divine gift, and they made it the focus of ritual from early times...The people perceived wheat
as a benevolent grain from the benevolent god, who according to the Old Testament chose to bestow the gift of the wheat harvest as a
reward to the righteous and chose to destroy the wheat harvest as a punishment to evildoers. In the New Testament, Jesus used wheat in 
his agricultural parables to illustrate the notion of resurrection...Long before Jesus...people understood the notion of 
death and rebirth when they witnessed the cycles of nature...Early people organized their lives around the seasonal calendar.
They celebrated the gift of grain by conducting elaborate agricultural rituals during critical times in the seasonal cycle. 
In Greek myth, the goddess Demeter gave wheat to the people, and the people who worshiped her understood the revelation
of the harvest...Many beliefs surrounding wheat applied to grain crops in general...The dieties of people credited with the
discovery and cultivation of wheat were culture heroes; they helped human beings advance by teaching them how to live  off
the land and control the production of food. The Ancient Egyptians credited by Isis and Orisis with teaching them the 
cultivation of both wheat and barley..."<br>

<b>American wheat</b><br>
Is it true that wheat was introduced to North America by the English when they started colonizing in the
17th Century? Yes, but this grain didn't flourish in these colonies until much later. The Spanish are actually credited for introducing
this crop to the New World in the 16th century.

"There is no evidence that wheat existed in the New World before Columbus brought it to Isabela on
Hispanolia in 1493, and it was introduced to Mexico by Hernando Cortes as of 1519. The Spanish
missionaries brougth the grain to Arizona and California in the eighteenth century. In the East wheat was
sown unsuccessfully by the Pilgrims, who made do with corn, and in Virginia tobacco was a more
profitable crop, so wheat was relegated to a minor role in that colony. It was not until it was planted in the
Mississippi Valley in 1718 by the Company of the West that wheat became an important Amercan crop,
increasingly so during the Civil War, when the mechanized Northern harvesters brought in far more wheat
for their troops than the Southerners could with manual labor."<br>

"Under ordinary circumstances, the colonists might have been expected to abandon corn as soon as
grains they knew better became available, as they did soon, for rye, barley, oats and wheat were all
planted in America in the seventeenth century. Adaptable as those grains are, they were slow to accustom
themselves to a new climate and for a long time failed to give yields sufficently important to drive out
corn--particularly the grain colonists would have proferred above all others, wheat. In New England wheat
was attacked by a smut disease called "the blast'; in Virginia it did not do well either, for it was planted
chiefly on land already exhausted by having grown one fo the most soil-depleting of all plants, tobacco. As
late as the end of the eighteenth century wheat was still so rare and so dear that it might as well not have
been there at all, so far as the great mass of working people were concerned, though their chief food was
bread. A laborer's average wage at this period was two shillings a day, which meat that it would take him
four days at least to earn enough money to buy a bushel of wheat, whos lowest quality was priced at eight
shillings and up."<br>

"Milk being highly perishable, of course, a few hours would be enought to start it fermenting in
the climate of the Near

into something pleasant

necessairly less rigid than
those of their modern counterparts. The curds might also be either fine or coarse. The finer type
was to develop
ultimately into the sharp, creamy substance represented today by the yoghurt of the Balkans, the
taetta of Scandinavia,
the dahi of India. The coarser kind, strained off, would make the first soft, fresh
cheese...Whatever the background to the

There is another
advantage which applies particularly to many Asians...Yoghurt is the Turkish name for the

"Yogurt, like cheese, was discovered long ago, when wandering herdsmen carrying mik in
sheepskin bags noticed that
the milk had curdled. People likely discovered both cheese and yogurt in the beginning of the
Neolithic era, when they
first began to practice milking. Nomadic herdsmen milked their animlas, then carried the milk in
pouches made out of
sheep's stomachs, the lining of which contains an enzyme called rennin, which curdles milk. The
Middle Eastern climate
was ideal fo curdling milk: left in the heat, milk curdled in just a few hours. Depending on the
degree of heat and the type
of bacteria in the environment, the curds would be find and develop into yogurt, or coarse and
develop into cheese.
Yogurt was most likely discovered by accident. As a product of milk, it was assigned similar
properties. 
     Milk and milk products have always been considered nothing short of magical. In fact, it has
been suggested that the
milk in the biblical phrase  milk and honey' referred to yogurt. As soon as the wandering herdsmen
discovered the
curdled milk, they tasted it and found it to their liking. It was not long before they perceived
health benefits that they
attributed to the curdled milk...Peasants in the Balkans live a long time, particuarly in Bulgaria,
and furthermore, many
of them retain their ability to conceived late in life. Both of these abilities have been attributed to

"Yoghurt... was known in France as early 1542, when Francois I was suffering from what would

who refused to travel
except on foot; he walted through the whole of southern Europe, followed by his flock. When he
finally arrived before
Francois I, the latter's apathy had given way to a certain impatience but he still did not feel well.

long walk and caught cold

went home, taking the secret of his brew with him. The health of Francois I continued to improve,
which was the point of

"Bulgarian Yogurt. Yogurt is a type of sour milk somewhat like adicolpilus milk which is soured with a viril strain of Bulgarian
bacteria. The advcantages of using yogurt rather than sweet milk, ordinary sour milk, or buttermilk are numerous. The bacteria in 
buttermlk and ordinary sour miks cannot live at body temperature; nor can they survive the hydrochoric acid of the stomach. Hence they
cannot live and multiply in the digestive tract. The principal reason for drinking yogurt is that its bacteria can live and 
multiply in the intestinal tract. The work of several scientists, especially Dr. Gustav Martin of the Warner Institute of 
Therapeutic Research, shows that the bacteria in yogurt actually manufacture or synthesize vitamins of the B famnily. For example, the 
bacteria for yogurt makes some of the anti-gray-hair vitamins. They also produce the vitamin which stimulates the growth of
hair supply biotin which is of tremendous importance to mental health. Yogurt has long been the staple food of the Bulgarians. These
people are noted for their vigor and longevity. Any kind of milk can be used for making yogurt--whole milk, skimmed milk, dry milk, or 
canned milk mixed with water. You can obtain yogurt from the leading dairies everywhere. Let your milk man bring you a 1/2 pint bottle of 
yogurt three times a week. With it you can make at least 6 quarts of delicious yogurt; simply add 1/2 bottle of yogurt to a quart
of milk. The yogurt bacteria must be kept warm so that they can multiply and sour the entire quart. In cold weather the milks hould be kept near a 
pilot light or the hot-water heater. In warm weather the milk sours at room temperature. Remember the bacteria live on the sugar
of the milk and break it down into lactic acid. This causes the milk to curdle and to become like junket; as soon as this 
happens, place the bottle in the refrigerator. The coldness stops the further growth of the bacteria and prevents the milk from becoming too
sour. If the milk is kept too warm, the curds separate and the beverage vecomes less appetizing. In addition to being a healthful
 drink, yogurt is also delicious when eaten like junket, plain or with fruit, or sweetened with honey or black molasses or, if you like, 
a bit of cinnamon. Yogurt makes excellent salad dressings, and is especially good on restricted diets, such as the Seven Day 
Elimination Diet. Simply add to thick yogurt a bit of lemon juice, some onion, parsley, or any other flavor you like. For the sake of
variety you could go completely Bulgarian and add a bit of dill or garlic."<br>

"Yogurt. One pleasant way to obtain many of the B vitamins is to drink milk fermented with Bulgarian milk cultures, as acidophilus

money, you can simply buy it regularly and eat to your heart's content. If you're not in the money, you can still eat to your heart's
content because one fifteen-cent bottle will make quarts and quarts of yogurt for you and your relatives and your inlaws--if you like
them enough. This is how you do it: Simply heat a quart of milk to lukewarm, not boiling. Then take 2 tablespoons of yogurt from your 
little bottle and mix it into the warm milk, using a wooden spoon. Put the milk back into the quart bottle and set the bottle
in a warm place--over a pilot light, near a radiator, over hot water, wherever is most convenient. It is much like setting bread
dough to raise--you want a place which will keep the yogurt warm but not cook it. Let it stand there for 6 to 8 hours, until the
milk curdles and solidifies like junket. As soon as it is firm, put it on ice, otherwise it will get too thick. When this quart is 
gone, make another quart, using another 2 tablespoons from your little bottle, and so on until the little bottle is used up. Then
you buy another fifteen-cent bottle and start again. If the dairies in your town have not yet begun to make yogurt, you can still
have it. Go to a health food store and ghuy a bottle of yogurt culture, then follow the directions on the package. Any kind of milk can 
be used to make yogurt--whole milk, skim milk, powdered milk, or evaporated milk mixed with water. If you are on a reducing
diet, enjoy your yogurt without a twinge of conscience by using milk with the fat removed."<br>

"The Ideal Diet. Every mouthfull you eat does you either good or harm. The secret of agelessness lies in eating intelligently, in 
<i>liking</i> to eat only those foods which are good for you. The ideal diet for long life is plenty of protein (milk--especially
yogurt*--eggs, lean meat, lean fish, fresh cheese)...*Yogurt: A semisolid cheeselike, or sometimes thickly fluid, preparation
from milk partly evaporated and then fermented by Lactobacillus bulgaricus.)...Excellent yogurt can be purchased in many
food stores. It can be eaten plain; seasoned with fresh or canned fruits; or made into a sundae with maple syrup, honey or 
blackstrap molasses. It is a ',ist' on the Live Longer diet. Among the Bulgarians where yogurt is a part of each meal but
where diet is not outstanding in other respects, the life span is longer than that of any other peoples in the world; Bulgarians are
credited with retaining the characteristics of youth to an extremely advanced age."<br>
---"Look Younger, Live Longer," Gayelord Hauser, condensed version, <i>Readers Digest</i>, October 1950 (p. 158-159)
<p>
<b>[1951]</b><br>
"Yogurt is a 'must' among the wonder foods because it is an excellent source of easily assimilated, high quality protein and 
contributes significant quantities of calcium and riboflavin to the diet. Yogurt fills a need that has long existed--that of a luncheon dish or 
a between-meal or bed-time snack. So many people eat what I call 'foodless foods' at such times--devil's cakes, pastries, cinnamon toast made
with white bread lavishly sprinkled with white sugar. A taste for yogurt is acquried quickly; you will become fonder and fonder of it as time goes on. It is a god hunger
satisfier and, most important of all, contributes much-needed vital food factors with every mouthful...Yogurt and the acidophilus or bulbgarius 
cultured milks have undergone many ups and downs in popularity. They have been advocated for everything from 'that tired 
feeling' to typhoid fever. My interest in yogurt is wholly concerned with nutrition, and form a nutritional  point of view it has much 
to contribute. Bulgarians are credited with retaining vigor, vitality, and the characteristics of youth to an extremely advanced
age; their longevity is traditional. Yogurt and certain cultured milks constitute a major item of diet for the Bulgarian
peasant. To state that all of these virtues stem solely from the consumption of yogurt is to treat the subject most superficially; 
climate, heredity, and other factors must be considered. But clearly the Bulgarians have established the nutritional excellency of 
yogurt. That, and that alone, first attracted me to yogurt and caused me to investigate and study it. Its superior nutritive qualities
caused me to recommend it to my students, and my faith in it has been justified in every respect...My favorite yogurt is made by
beating into a pint of water the following ingredients: 1 1/2 cups of powdered skim milk; 3 tablespoons of previously made (or commercial)
yogurt; and 1 large can of evaporated milk. When this mixture is beaten smooth, this should be added to 1 quart of water and poured into 
glasses which are set in a large pan containing enough warm water to ready the top of the glasses. The pan should then be set over a 
warming unit, pilot light, or simmer burner and the temperature of the water kept between 105 and 135 degrees Fahrenheit...The yogurt
should thicken and be ready to chill on 3 hours. If it requires longer time, the temperature probably has run too low. Yogurt
can be eaten plain; seasoned with chives or other herbs; served with fresh or canned fruits; or made into a sundae with maple
syrup, honey, or blackstrap molasses."<br>

Zucchini (aka <a href="foodfaq2.html#vegetablemarrow">vegetable marrow</a>, Italian squash) is a fine example of New World foods circuitously introduced to the USA via Europe. In this case? Italy. The word 
"zucchini" is the Italian diminutive for the word "gourd," [zucca].
<p>
"Zucchini, the Italian and American name for what the French and many English speaking people call courgettes, any of 
several varieties of squash...which have been developed for this purpose and are still relatively small...when mature, or 
small young specimens of other varieties of the same species which belong to the vegetable marrow group and would grow 
much larger if left alone. This is one of the most attractive and delicious of the cucurbit vegetable fruits, but only 
became prominent in the 20th century. In the 1920s, when the learned Dr. Leclerc was writing, the French still referred to 
courgettes d'Italie, and it seems clear that it was the Italians who first marketed the vegetable marrows in a small size; 
and that it is therefore appropriate tho choose their name zucchini rather than the French name...The 19th-century French 
author Vilmorin-Andrieux...gave a illustration of the elongated variety of marrow grown in Italy...The English translator
 added, more than half a century before the hour of the zucchini struck: 'This should be tried in England.' Vilmorin, 
incidentally, had given the Italian name as cocozello di Napoli. That there is no true English name reflects the fact,
 that, although courgettes were mentioned...in a few English recipe books of the 1930s, they only became popular in 
England after Elizabeth David in the 1950s and 1960s had introduced them...to readers of her books; and that as zucchini 
they had a similarly late arrival in the USA, where Italian immigrants made the introduction."<br>

<b>Zucchini bread</b><br>
  Zucchini bread descends from a long line of European sweet vegetable puddings dating
  back to the Middle Ages. Carrot pudding is one of the oldest examples. Sweet potato
  pudding/pie followed in the Renaissance. Carrot pudding crossed from vegetable to
   <a href="foodcakes.html#carrotcakedessert">cake dessert</a> in the 20th century. 
<a href="foodpies.html#sweetpotatopie">Sweet potato pie</a> remains on the dinner table. 
After WWII, zucchini proved prolific in mainstream <a href="foodfaq2.html#zucchini">American home gardens</a>. Which meant?
Too much zucchini. Just like leftover Thanksgiving turkey, recipes proliferated. Zucchini bread (portable, easy, healthy, 
freezer-friendly) to the rescue!
  <p>

  Food historians generally drop zucchini bread squarely in the American 1960s & 70s. It
  was promoted (as was carrot cake and banana bread) as a *healthy* alternative to
  standard desserts. Was it actually healthier? It depended upon the amount/type of flour,
  sweetener and fat used in recipe. Generally the bread employs fresh zucchini, which
  argues logically for the healthy case. Like banana bread, zucchini bread is not frosted. 
  <p>
  "Zucchini bread. A deliciously moist, full-flavored bread that became popular in the  60s
  and remains so today. It's a splendid way to cope with a summer gusher of zucchini
  because the bread freezes so well."<br>

  Our survey of American newspaper articles published in 1950s-1970s confirms the popularity of zucchini. Recipes for zucchini
bread proliferate in the mid-1970s. One of the earliest (& perhaps most influential) recipes is this gift from James Beard:
<br><blockquote>
<b><a href="foodfaq2.html#gohs">"Carl Gohs'</a> Zucchini Bread</b><br>
This rather unusual loaf has a very pleasant flavor, a little on on the sweet side, and a distinctive texture. The built-in
moisture provided by the zucchini makes it a very good keeper. It can be prepared with 1 cup of whole-wheat flour instead of 
all white flour.  [2 loaves]
<p>
3 eggs<br>
2 cups granulated sugar<br>
1 cup vegetable oil<br>
2 cups grated, peeled, raw zucchini<br>
3 teaspoons vanilla extract<br>
3 cups all-purpose flour<br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>
1 teaspoon baking soda<br>
1/4 teaspoon double-acting baking powder<br>
3 teaspoons ground cinnamon<br>
1 cup coarsely chopped filberts or walnuts<br>
Beat the eggs until light and foamy. Add the sugar, oil, zucchini, and vanilla and mix lightly but well. Combine the flour,
salt, soda, baking powder, and cinnamon and add to the egg-zucchini mixture. Stir until well blended, add nuts, and pour into two
9 X 5 X 3-inch loaf pans. Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 1 hour. Cool on a rack."<br>

<b>Who was Carl Gohs?</b><br>
A Portland Oregon-based food writer/author who knew & supported James Beard's culinary endeavors. Mr. Gohs played a key
role facilitating the famous classes Mr. Beard taught at the Seaside High School during the 1970s.
<p>
<a href="gohs1973.pdf">James Beard at Seaside</a>/Carl Gohs, <i>Northwest Magazine, The Oregonian</i>, September 30, 1973 (p. 13)
<p>
"Carl Gohs of Portland, who for many years wrote a food column for <i>The Oregonian's Northwest Magazine</i>, traveled in 
Southern France with Beard in 1972 then Beard was researching and writing his book, 'Beard on Bread.' 'We stayed at Julia Child's
house outside Cannes,' Gohs said. 'There he went over manuscripts for the book. I scouted out French breads for his approval. 'He was
incredibly generous in helping people along the way who were starting out in the food business, writing a cookbook, writing a 
newspaper column or whatever,' Gohs said. 'He would always lend not just his name but assistance and time as well.'...Beard, who since
1971 has taught summer course at Seaside High School, once recalled that Oregon and its foods had made a profound impression on 
his career.."<br>
---"Friends, associates fondly recall Beard," Steve Erickson, <i>The Oregonian</i>, January 24, 1985 
<p>
"[James Beard's] memory held stockpiles of bread recipes that began with a raisin loaf his mother had baked for benefit teas that she had given for the British Red Cross during World
 War I in San Francisco's Palace Hotel...He remembered breads baked by his friends--Emil Kashouty's pita, Janet Wurtzburger's health bread made with home-ground flour, and one of 
wheat germ and potatoes created by Carl Gohs, a Portland Writer."<br>

<p>
"The Seaside High School home economics teacher, Maryon Greenough, had, together with Portland food writer Carl Gohs, done the groundwork, and the classes 
immediately clicked with an ineffable rightness: Beard--his legs somewhat restored by walking and weight loss-omniscently prowled the room, and each day the 
eighteen students turned up earlier and stayed later, never able to get quite enough of Beard or of one another. Beard Bead himself ended each afternoon in a state of 
exhaustion and elation: As never before he grew in the role of teacher, as though adding layers of nuance and depth to a part he played dozens of times before and 
whos every gesture and inflection he until then though he knew in every possible aspect. But the students came each day not just to practice cooking, but to see what
 frollery or prank or shtick he might set loose; and the truth was he heardly knew himself what energies and enthusiasms the nonsecript classroom down the road from
 the onetime Gearhart depot might pull out of him."<br>

other collections of Atkeson's color photographs that followed sold more than 500,000 copies."<br>
