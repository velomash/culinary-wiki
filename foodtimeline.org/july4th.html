"We find the following patriotic advertisement in a late paper printed at Lexington, Kentucky. The 'bra' lads and 'bonnie lassies' of that state unite in 
celebrating the independence of our country, and on the happy occasion fully partake of 'foreign and domestic liquors' and of a hog broiled whole, or or
Barbecue (a word they barbarously spell Barbacue:"). Barbaque. The subscriber respectfully informs the citizens of Fayette and adjoining counties 
that he will prepare an elegant Barbacue Dinner on the Fourth of July, at his own house, on Limestone Road, nine miles from Lexington, and about the same distance from 
Paris. There will be an elegant arbor and seats prepared for the ladies and gentlemen, to amuse themselves in dancing. Excellent music is engaged for that purpose.
The subscriber furnished foreign liquors of the best quality for the LADIES--the gentlemen will have free access to the use of domestic liquors. Tickets of admittance--
two dollars--there will be no expense omitted to render his entertainment brilliant and interesting. June 12. James Green."<br>

"For the ast forty years every Fourth of July has been celebrated by the good ladies of Northampton, (Mass.) by a pic nic [sic] or rural tea party, upon a beautiful green in the 
vicinity of that pleasant town. Every succeeding year adds fresh interest and beauty to the delightful custom. It is usually served up in a grove, the ladies having the chief 
management. Tables, decorated with evergreens and beautiful flowers, and loaded with refreshments of the richest kind are contributed by the families in town. Eighty
lady managers preside, assisted by delegated gentlemen. Music is in attendance, and a dance on the green follows during the afternoon. It is a rational and
pretty entertainment, free from the selfishness of political festivals and dinner parties, from which the women are always arbitrarily excluded. It is a healthy, a
gladsome, a delightful amusement, and one we should like to see more generally prevalent."<br>

"Fourth of July celebrations aboard Califonia-bound ships in 1849 were planned and implemented by passengers. Both the manner of organizing the celebration and the 
individual elements of the observance parallel the event ashore. Becuase so many forty-niners travdeled to Califonia in company with friends and business partners, there
was an internal structure to brousl that eased celebration planning. Committees were formed, orators selected, readers of the Declaration designated, prayer leaders chosen, and
other details arranged for a celebration as similar as possible to what they had known at home. Not surprisingly then, the forty-niner's day at sea began with noise, followed by
breakfast. Then came a program very similar to those we have already seen, with speakers, music and toast--on some ships with alcohol, on others, in a time of
temperance-consciousness, with water. As decent a dinner as provisions and conditions allowed was served at noon.'<br>

“With comendable liberality the citizens of Magnolia and vicinity determined to celebrate the anniversaary of the American Independence Day, by giving a Free Baarvecue.
The Fourth coming on Sunday the Saturday preceding was selected as the most suitable day. Early in the morning a large company left our town for the appointed place. After two
hours ride we arrived in Magnolia and there learned that the Barbecue would be given at the Sulpher Spring about one mile above Magnolia, on the River. After resting a short time, we 
started for the ground and upon our arrival found that a large crowd had already assembled. The people came from every direction; some on horseback, and some in carriges, while yet
others made use of that primative vehicle known as an ox wagon. The candidates for District Attorney being present they were invited to address the audiencce, and
each one responded with a brief speech...At the conclusion of their speeches dinner was announced. Seated on a large log on top of the hill o'erlooking the table, we
enjoyed the scene presented, when the gentlemen charged upon the edibles. The old, the young, and the middle-aged ran forward pell mell and little did they care for 
others. Here you might see the old man scrambling for possession of that excellent mutton-joint, whilst yonder a fine specimen of 'Young America' would be eagerly
clutching after a dish of roasting-ears. One individual we noticed, sauntered around carelessly, did not appear to be noticing anything in particular,--all at once he
made a rush towards the table,--for a moment he was lost to view in the crowd, then he re-appeared with a bottle of claret wine under one arm, a jar of pickles under 
the other, a chunk of meat in one hand and a loaf of bread in the other. He hastily beat a retreat to a safe distance, then leisurely proceeded to discuss the merits of
the several articles his prowess had obtained...At night there was a pleasant party at the house of W. A. Hagood, Esq., who, with his usual liberality, tendered the young
people free use of his Saloon for the purpose of 'tripping the light fantastic toe.'"<br>

"We would call the attention of our citizens to the excursion and basket picnic at Babock's Grove, on the approaching Fourth of July...A table will be set in the 
grove with refreshments for those who prefer to buy rather than to carry their dinners, and there will be hot tea and coffee, ice cream, lemonade, oranges and other fruits, 
on sale on the grounds. Donations of provisions for the furnishing of this table, cold meats, biscuit, cake, pastry &c., are earnestly solicited.<br>

"Union soldiers celebrated two holidays a year that their enemy dis not necessrily observe. One was the Fourth of July. Early in the war, Confederates, too venerated it as the 
anniversary of American freedom and celebrated as they could. Even in the earthworks and forts surrrounding Port Hudson, Louisiana, where a beseiged Confederate garrison
found itself steadiy driven toward starvation, the defenders strove to make something special for the holiday. Their skimpy beef ration already exhausted, they began eating 
mule on July 1, 1863. 'All who partook of it spoke highly of the dish,' said one Rebel. 'Mule meat was regularly served out in rations to the troops from and after 4th of 
July.'...Yankees officers held Fourth of July banquets beneath leafy arbors in their garrisons, and when possible, the day came with them all on campaign or as in 1863, exhausted from
recent battle, and it passsed with only a modicum of culinary observance. The Sanitary Commission attempted to encourage celebration of the Fourth by sending special
treats to the armies, fresh vegetables in 1864, for instance, but the distribution came to little more than two or three onions and tomatoes for each man, much 
diluting the holiday meal. Some men actually managed to save things from their Christmas boxes for months, in order to bring them out for the Fourth, such as canned
salmon and green peas that appeared on a 1st New York Infantry officer's table in 1864. Rhode Island officers in the army besieging Petersburg in 1864 celebrated the day with 
canned stewed oysters, canned roast turkey, bread pudding, tapioca pudding, an apple pie made in camp, and lemonade."<br>

"New Englanders marked Independence Day with seasonal fare. Tradition has it that salmon, peas, and new potatoes made up one common menu. Nathan Fish confirms part of this 
in his diary entry or 4 July 1868: 'Had salmon, Peas and beans.' A whole poached or baked salmon, often served with an egg sauce, made an impressive centerpiece...salmon,
because of its size, firm texture, and flavor, conveyed more status and elegance to a meal than, for example, cod or haddock. Green peas and new potatoes at dinner
meant the last of fresh peas before hot weather ad the earliest of new potatoes. According to his diary, Nathan Fish didnt have new potatoes that year until two weeks
after the Fourth. The beans he speaks of could have been early green beans; it was a little too early for shell beans."<br>

“An old-fashioned Fourth of July barbecue—something that the present generation never witnessed—is advertised by the Chylor brothers, to take place at the State Fair-grounds. A 1,600-pound ox and numerous fine fat sheep are to be served up free, and then the crowd are to be treated to No. 1 trotting, passing, and running games, music and dancing. Inshort, a glorious, old-fashioned, happy celebration of the Fourth of July may be looked for.”<br>

“Berlin, July 5, 1894.—The Fourth of July this year turned out a day of remarkable pleasure at the Hotel Bristol. Some forty prominent Americans, with their ladies, 
which happened to be here, were invited by Mr. Uhl, the proprietor, to participate in a dinner ostensibly in honor of Independence Day, but which turned out to be Mr. Uhl’s engagement to Miss Eva Bechtel, of Jersey City, daughter of the former mayor of Stapleton, a very rich and beautiful young lady. The house was one mass of American flags and flowers, and when the guests assembled with a number of native celebrities from the ministry, the arts and commerce, they were even more surprised by the novel bill of fare than by the extravagant decoration and appointments which had been lavished irregardless of expense. In the surprising space of forty eight hours the court engraver, Herr A. Liebmann, had prepared from a copper plate a menu with President Cleveland’s likeness on the front page, even more perfect than the best of photos, and on the inside some wag had translated the French dishes into the following somewhat unpoetic comparisons: Lobster a la Grover, Spring chicken a la Mrs. Cleveland, Artichokes a la 
Tammany, Souffle au chocolade a la Lillian Russell, Patisserie a la Washington Post, Paillets au parmessir a la Yankee Doodle.”<br>

“New York, July 8.—Five hundred persons at Wappinger’s Falls, N.Y., were poisoned at an Independence Day Picnic by eating ham sandwiches, most of which had been cooked in a copper bottomed kettle. Three hundred of the afflicted ones suffered severely and are not yet well, but none has died. In every case, man and child, the symptoms were alike—violent cramps and spasms, nausea and burning fever. The physicians found the meat so thoroughly permeated with the poison that if any one had eaten largely of it the result would surely have been fatal.”<br>

"The complaint has often been made by very young ladies and frequently by older young ladies, that the Fourth of July was a day much ore enjoyed by boys and young
men than by the members of their sex. There are ways, however, in which the young lady may both enjoy and celebrate the occasion. An Independence day party is one of 
these. Once assembled at the home of the hostess, the guests may enjoy themselves by any of the customary methods adopted by young ladies upon such occasions. They should however, 
wear some patriotic emblems such as red, white and blue sashes or ribbons, and a very pleasant feature of the occasion would be for each guest to come prepared, by request, to give
some information regarding the women of Revolutionary times. The crowning feature of the event should be the lunch. The room in which this is served should be well
decorated with flags and bunting of the national colors, while such Revolutionary pictures as George and Martha Washington, the battle of Bunker Hill, the Boston ea party,
Washington crossing the Delaware, the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the surrender of Cornwallis, etc., should adorn the walls if they are obtainable. The
table should be draped about the edge with tricolored bunting and a knot of this or a flag draped about each chair. If possible, secure a well-mounnted American eagle to 
place in the center of the table, with a flag draped about the base. At each plate place a paper or muslin flag for a napkin, and upon each plate mount a formidable 
cannon, made by securing two oranges and a banana with a long wooden or metal in. A tiny flag stuck in the lower end of the banana will add to the effect. The manu should have
at the top a flag, either a real one fastened on or one put on with colors. At the bottom a drawing of the cracked Liberty bell would e in keeping with the idea, while at
either side attach a genuine firecracker. The lunch menu may be either printed or written, and should read as follows:<p>
<center>
Pastriotic sandwiches<br>
Ham and tongue, a la Valley Forge<br>
Star cookies and stripe cake<br>
Pinwheels   Washingto pie<bfr>
Giant firecrackers<br>
Cannnon    Torpedoes<br>
iced tea (without tax)<br>
Pink lemonade, a la July 4
</center>
<p>
The patriotic sandwiches should be small, dainty sandwiches tied with red, white and blue ribbons. The meats, 'a la Valley Forge,' would of course be cold. Star-shaped 
frosted cookies and layer cake explains the next time. A slice of jelly roll is an excellent imitation of a pinwheel. Deep pink strawberry ice cream, made in molds with a shred of
cocoanut fuse, makes the giant firecracker. Put confectionery in small bags or tinfoil and over this twist red tissue paper in imitation of torpedoes. The cannon has already
been described. The Washington pie and iced tea need no comment. Serve a straw with the lemonade and in the straw place a tiny flag. The napkins and menu cards will make good 
souvenirs for the guests. A display of fireworks in the evening, superintended by some male member of the family, together with patriotic songs, would be a fitting finale for 
the occasion, and it is safe to assume that such a celebration would be thoroughly enjoyed by the young ladies. The older ones would also find this lunch menu suitable, or they
could give a dinner party and reception or social hop. For the dinner party the menus should be decorrated like the one already described, and contain the following. For the
United States soup any light stock will do. Into this place a quantity of macaroni letters 'U' and 'S.' Macaroni now comeds stamped out in all the letters of the
alphabet. Turkey is of course our native bird. The giant firecrackders, pinwheels, cannon torpedoes and lemonade have been previously described. The menu:<p>

Red sliced tomatoes     White iced cucumbers<br>
Blue cabbage cold slaw<br>
Plymouth Rock cod<br>
Spanish mackerel (done brown)<br>

"An informal porch party, with the right sort of hostess, will rouse enthusiasm...More strenuous but quite as well worthwhile, are community picnics...Refreshsments...
should be hoemade if practicable. Too often our fashions for public luncheons aare settled by the caterers, and what they find it most convenient to serve. Wherever there is a 
historical aspect about our picnic...why not plan the food to be served to fit the period as carefully as we do the costumes? Few would be ready to lend choice, old
china, even to decorate the tables, but it may be there are some pewter platters and pitchers, that would not be injured by use, and would lend an 'air' to the whole feast.
Pies and doughnuts, loaf cakes and cookies are to be chosen rather than the ices and angel cakes of the present day, and often will win applause because they are less common
than ice cream. Since ice cream cones have become daily food, it is no longer a rarity, a 'treat,' in the old sense of that word."<br>

“Bretton Woods, N.H.--July Fourth celebrations in the country towns of the White Mountains are attracting any number of people from the cities, and many are making their journeys by motor to the hills at this time to enjoy the novelty of the old-fashioned merrymaking…Over the border in Maine many White Mountain tourists went on Saturday to hear Mellie Dunham, Henry Ford’s old fiddler, who came from his home at Norway, Me., to play for a real old-time barn dance…Life in the White Mountains’ resort centres is always most informal until late July and there are many motor excursions, picnics, trout and bass fishing expeditions and mountain climbing parties…Cooking trout over fires on the lake and brook shores and barbecues of lamb will be indulged in by many parties coming to the hills to spend the July 4 holidays.”<br>

“Boys of St. Joseph’s Home and School who had been dreaming for the past several weeks of a real outdoor ‘weenie roast’ on Independence Day awoke with saddened faces yesterday as they saw the rain. However, their disappointed expressions were soon turned to broad grins when they were told that the feast was to be held indoors. Absence of the odor of burning leaves and an improvised stove made with stones did not detract from the success of the celebration inside the home. The weenies, and there were hundreds of them, tasted just the same, the lads testified. The picnic was a revelation to a number of visitors. They saw a group of healthy, sturdy, real American boys who have been permitted to develop naturally under the guidance of the corps of Sisters of the Holy Cross.”<br>

"The Fourth of July has a way of becoming a holiday for everyone but mother unless she diverts the current. The children want picnics or parties, and father wants a 
good time. So does mother for that matter, only a good time is a bit more
difficult or her because she is responsible for the food for family and friends who may drop in. Her good time depends on her forethought. She really can act with 
surprising ease as a magic combination hostess, mother and dispenser of favors. That is, she can if she plans the main dish or two she can prepare the day before, and if she
buys plenty of paper plates, cups, glasses, napkins and so forth to do away with dishwashing and other service on what often proves to be a boiling hot day. To our 
grandmothers, Fourth of July meant lamb and green peas. Here is an adaptation of the menu Robinson Crusoe immortalized in wrestling it from the virgin soil of a South Sea isle: Jellied Lamb and Green Peas,

“Tomorrow’s the Fourth, the Cousins are coming, and what shall we have for dinner? If you’re stalking a red, white and blue color scheme, there are grand possibilities in the offing. To start with blue, the most difficult of the trio—apparently nature didn’t intend us to eat much blue from the dearth of foods painted that hue. But we can approach blue in grape juice, blueberries, and a few such foods. Let’s restrain ourselves from blending blue coloring with gelatins and such unreceptive mediums. As a rule we’ll find the table accessories—dishes, glassware, flowers, or doilies best set off this color note. Red invites itself generously into menus in the form of baby beets, pimientos, dashes of paprika, red-skinned apples, cinnamon-candy-tinted apples and pears, red cabbage, tomato dishes, red radishes, pinky slices of ham and all sorts of cherries, berries and other rosy appetite tempters. In addition, there is always the convenient bottle of red coloring. White isn’t hard to effect. But now for particulars. The following menu has been planned with one eye on the color scheme and the other on schemes for keeping mother out of the kitchen as much as possible during the holiday. Fourth of July Dinner: White Grape Cocktail with Raspberry Juice, Jellied Ham, Chantilly Potatoes, New Green Peas with Mint Sauce, Celery Aspic on Tomato Slices, Clover Refrigerator Rolls, Red Radish Roses and White Icicle Radishes, Pineapple and Cherry Refrigerator Cake, Iced Tea or Coffee. First, sweetened red raspberry juice poured over halved white grapes in stemmed sherberts and footed with small blue doilies will give the patriotic atmosphere without6 quite obliging the guests to stand up and salute. The jellied ham loaf and the refrigerator rolls may be prepared ahead of time and kept in the refrigerator. Garnish each slice of the jellied meat with a dainty sprig of parsley. Chantilly potatoes are simply glorified left-over mashed potatoes. Warm the mashed potatoes over a pan of hot water and whip a little hot milk into them. Pile four cups of these potatoes into a casserole and spread over them one-half cup of cream, beaten stiff, topped with one-half cup of grated cheese. Place the casserole in a hot oven and bake until the cheese is melted and the cream a delicate brown. Alternate the crdesip red radish roses with the long white icicle radishes on your prettiest relish plate. New green peas are minted by adding one-quarter cup of finely chopped mint leaves to a thin hot white sauce which is served over the cooked peas. Small round molds of lemon gelatin containing finely chopped celery and unmolded on large slices of red tomatoes form a delectable salad course. And, finally, mix plump red maraschino cherries into the pineapple refrigerator cake when you prepare it. Slice the cake crosswise so that the cherries will show and serve on blue paper doilies or on blue glass plates. Tip with snowy whipped cream.”<br>

“You can’t have too many ideas for the Fourth of July picnic. Whether you go away or stay at home for the celebration, the food should be festive and tempting. Today, however, let’s concentrate on the stay-at-home picnic. Set the scene under a big shade tree or on the screened porch, with a table for the food and a few comfortable porch chairs or cushions. Place at one end of the table, the paper napkins, plates and cups and just the necessary flat silver. Visualize a big salad bowl with a crisp vegetable salad, a tray of cold spreads and sliced meats for sandwich fillings, a cutting board holding all the necessary sliced bread and crackers to satisfy the biggest appetite, one hot casserole dish, if the day is not too warm and a big pot of hot coffee or pitcher of ice tea with a tray of paper cups close by. Dessert may be a big cake—brought out at the close of the meal, a big bowl of fresh fruit, a short cake or frozen dessert. <br>

Salad bowl—Cucumbers, tomato quarters, head lettuce, radishes and celery dressed with French dressing. Arrange in large crockery or wooden bowl. Jelly and pickles.

“Fourth of July…brings up the subject of picnics. For what’s an Independence day if it means a lot of overcooked ladies and hours of extra labor in the kitchens, preparing feasts and foolishness…In keeping with this spirit of emancipation let’s change the order of outgoing and make the sandwiches where and when we picnic, not stew over them at home. So make it a buy-it-as-you-go picnic and do it buffet style. Stop at the grocer’s and supply yourself with butter, sliced bread or buns, cheese, jams, peanut butter, assorted cold meats, a jar of salad dressing, and a head of lettuce. A good delicatessen will furnish the salad or a few ingredients in the way of fresh vegetables or fruits may be poked into a bag and the salad made ‘on location.’…<br>

A stout pocket knife for cutting toasting wands—if you’re fond of fire building and toasting is part of the program. 7.

<b>"Independence Day Luncheon.</b> You may, of course, expect warm weather for the Fourth and what could be more fun than to entertain with a picnic for your friends? Tell 
the each to bring one kind of food or, if you are ambitious, you take all of the lunch. Also, it is fun to make favors suitable to the day, fireworks, ideas and prizes for 
games, red, white, and blue lunch cloths and a flag of our country. Everyone will adore a small flag-raising with salute and allegiance. If any Girl or Boy Scouts are along they
will attend to this ceremony for you. A portable phonograph will furnish music...July is the time of year when a wafer, a glass of tea, and a deck of cards just about
fill the bill. But, as just a little food is required, that little must be extra good and attractively served. Above all, the whole process must be simple enough so that the 
hostess may be as cool as her guests. Had you ever noticed how patriotic our gardens are at this time? There are any number of red and blue flowers in many shades in 
bloom at this season...The food for this affair...is distinctly seasoned, good to look upon and so easily prepared. 'Firecrcackers' and 'sparkle' punch! Small individual jelly rolls 
wrapped in red celophane and a zippy fruit drink both make for a safe, sane, and noiseless Fourth! You may, in most cities, buy the small jelly rolls at about 60 cents a 
dozen. (Be sure they are made with red jelly.)
<p>
<b>Firecrcacker Jelly Rolls</b><br>
3 eggs, yolks and whites separated<br>
1/2 cupful of sugar<br>
1/2 teaspoonful of vanilla<br>
1/4 teaspoonful of lemon extract<br>
1/2 cupful of sifted pastry flour<br>
1/8 teaspoonful of salt<br>
Strawberry jelly<br>
Beat egg whites until stiff; add sugar gradually, beating constantly. Beat egg yolks until thick and lemon colored, and fold in egg whites and flavoring, using long deep
strokes. When well blended, fold in gradually the flour and salt, which have been sifted once together. Line the bottom of two 6- by 10-inch pans with wax paper. Pour in the batter to 
a depth of 1/4 inch. Bake ten minutes at 375 degrees F. Watch carefully, as it bakes quickly. Turn out quickly onto a damp cloth, trim crust from edges, and remove wax
paper. Spread the strawberry jelly and roll up, starting at one side so that you have long, narrow rolls. Wrap up tightly in the cloth and let remain until cool. Cut each roll into
three pieces, three inches long. Repeat recipe to make 12 individual rolls. It will cost in the neighborhood of 35 cents to make 12 rolls. When cool, wrap each roll in red
Cellophane, twisting one end to simulate the fuse of the firecracker...Leave the other end open and trim close to the jelly roll shortly before serving. This will make them
easier for the guests to unwrap. Serve each one on a white or glass dessert plate.
<p>
<b>'Sparkler' Punch</b><br>
(serves 12)<br>
2 No. 2 cans pineapple juice<br>
2 No. 2 cans of grapefruit juice<br>
2 16-ounce bottles of ginger ale<br>
Chill all the ingredients thoroughly, and mix just before serving. For a extra color touch use 'two-toned' ice cubes in each glass. 'Two-toned' ice cubes start out to be
just ordinary ice cubbes. Proceed as usual, but when the ice 'shell' is formed in all the cubes take from the refrigerator and empty the remaining water from the 
tray. Tint this water with red vegetable coloring; fill up the ice 'shells' again and finish freezing. This gives a silvery red effect that is pleasing to the eye. The 
fruit juice costs 13 cens a can, the ginger ale 17 cents a bottle, brining the total cost for the punch to 90 cents. The total food cost for the 12 guests will be between
$1.25 and $1.50. That's easy, too! Prizes may be wralled in white over red tissue, and tied with blue ribbonn. Incidentally, a gorgeous Roman candle makes an appropriate
consolation prize!"<br>

"The Fourth of July traditionally has been the occasion for the grownups to put the children into the family car and start out to visit the folks down on the farm, or to take a 
picnic lunch to the dunes or just stay at home with a pitcher of lemonade and enough firecrackers to annoy the neighbors and endanger the children's arms and eyes...But this
year times have changed. This year the family is too busy fighting a war to keep the nation which grew from those 13 states free of oppression to take a day off. In many
cases, father, mother and even the older children are giving up their celebration to stay at their machines turning out tanks, guns and bullets. Brother in the army won't get home 
this Fourth and the home front stands firm behind him. Bathing suits hand limply in the closet, as Chicago lathes, drill presses and forges roar out the victory tune. On Saturday at the 
Stewart-Werer plant, 1218 Diversey Parkway, thousand so workers and the officials will work to fill vital orders for the nation's armed forces, under a poster proclaiming
'Every minute I Waste Is a Help to the Enemy.' Quietly, with no fanfare, these Americans are doing their share in the war effort. 'We're going to have a real celebration--
we're going to work harder all day. There's no time for a ceremony, for we're just getting into the rhythm now,' thus George F. Thomas, plant superintendent,

“The Fourth of July always means food, and plenty of it, usually connected with a rousing good picnic. Altho ham is not mentioned on the list of best buys, you’ll 
find it featured in all the groceries for the holiday. It seems to be quite a favorite. It ranges in price from almost moderate to substantially high, depending upon 
the cut you want. Qhole hams cost less than portions, and the butt end is higher priced than the shank end. You may obtain cooked hams for not too high a price. 
Sliced ham, however, is expensive. If you’re just going to stay at home to enjoy the Fourth, you may wish to take advantage of a bargain in rib roast of beef or beef 
pot roast, or buy one of them for Sunday dinner. Some stores in the city offer a pork loin roast priced not too high. Other markets have boneless corned beef brisket
 and boneless stewing beef in the moderate range. One economy piece of meat is plate boiling beef. Chicken giblets are offered at some stores very moderately, but 
the chicken livers alone cost considerably more. You’ll be paying a few cents a pound more for choice sirloin and porterhouse steaks this week-end than customary. 
Skinless frankfurters are being featured by some stores for a moderate price, and assorted cold meat cuts remain moderately high. Fish prices are rather high for the 
holiday week-end, with the Selkirk whitefish, a Canadian variety, and yellowpike being the only moderately priced ones for now. Somewhat higher than these two are 
lake trout, whitefish, yellow perch, halibut, and shrimp. All will probably cost less after the Fourth. You’ll probably leave the fruit and vegetable markets with an 
overloaded basket. The red and black raspberries alone are enough to make your mouth water. The red are higher priced than the black. There are luscious red plums, 
some moderate, the Formosa variety, some higher in price, Santa Rosa being the choicest. Strawberries, alas, are almost out of season, with the best of them being 
only fair in quality. But blueberries, tho still high, are becoming more plentiful. Sweet cherries tempt you with their red or deep, almost purple coloring. Bing cherries are more plentiful than the other kinds. Peaches are a trifle lower, and 
you can now obtain freestones as well as the clingstones which are large and red cheeked. Cantaloupe and honeyball and honeydew melons are all reasonably priced. 
Watermelons are lower than they have been and are plentiful. New green apples are a trifle lower, while the good quality old apples mount in price. Grapefruit also 
is high. Nectarines and figs now are available tho expensive. There are a few currants on the market, priced about the same as cherries per box, and gooseberries are
 available quite reasonably. Gooseberries must share rhubarb’s lack of attention because they, too, require so much of our precious sugar. Lemons and limes are
 moderate, and oranges have come down a bit in price. Brown skinned avocados look like a worthwhile buy. Besides the best buys listed in vegetables, asparagus is 
moderate, 
and in the smaller asparagus is really cheap. Broccoli from California, carrots, caulflower, and celery are all moderate. The quality of cauliflower is mostly good. 
Corn still 
holds its rather high price, and egg plant is scarce. Altho cucumbers have risen slightly, they're moderately priced just the same. Since iceberg lettuce costs a little
more, you might try reasonable endive or escarole. Alternates for moderately high spinach are mustard greens and turnip tops. Green peppers are moderate, dry onions are
cheap, and bunch turnips and white squash are reasonable. Acorn and yellow squash are relatively expensive, and both green peas and mushrooms demand a high price."<br>

“Box luncheons neatly packed with sandwiches and cake, or more elaborately, with half a broiled chicken and vegetable salad, may be helpful to many Fourth of July 
excursionists whether their trip is by car, train, plane, boat or via subway to a cool picnic spot near by. The Schrafft stores among the places here, where prepared
 lunches are available. In a special carton that opens to make an individual tray, Schrafft’s offers any one of eight different combinations ranging in price from 85
 cents to $1.50. For example, selection No. 1 consists of chicken and fresh vegetable salad, queen olives, sweet pickles, potato chips, buttered finger rolls and 
apple pie. Napkins and other equipment are included, all for $1.50. You may leave your thermos bottle at the store, and it will be filled with a hot or iced drink.
 It’s best to order the day before, although for simple sandwich combinations you may call up before 10 A.M. of the day that you wish them. There is no delivery, but
 many Schrafft stores will be open July 4—twelve in Manhattan, one in the Bronx, two in Brooklyn, one in Newark, one in New Rochelle and one in White Plains…Just
 because you live in a hotel room with no facilities for making sandwiches doesn’t mean that you can’t have a picnic on the Fourth. The Cookery, 947 Madison Avenue, 
makes up a special basket with a pie like a hat box. The price depends on what you order. It may be sandwiches (turkey, ham, etc.) or fried chicken, a slice of 
home-made chocolate cake, cole slaw, etc. Or if you’re stumped for ideas the Cookery has a number of interesting suggestions. For one thing the store makes its own ice cream, which it packs in dry ice to go along on the trip. Paper spoons and forks are provided too…For people who are going to spend the week-end at a country cottage, the Casserole King, 782 Madison Avenue, assembles a picnic basket that will relieve them of most of the cooking for the entire time they are there. Casseroles of beef a la mode or roast turkey…Or you may order cold dishes that won’t require any warming up if you prefer. With these main courses come a mixed green salad and French rolls. The price is about $1.95 a person. Soup and desserts are offered for an additional 30 to 35 cents a portion.”<bfr>

"For that immortal masterpiece, the Declaration of Independence, we have a birthday celebration every year on the Fourth of July. It is one day on which it is well to think about 
what freedom means. Hunt up a copy of the Declaration of Independence and take time to read it through. Gather around the piano and sing The Battle
Hymn of the Republic and My Country, 'Tis of Thee as they should be sung. From these great and beautiful words of the past renew the courage and the conviction that our
forefathers had. And for the menu of such a birthday dinner give a little thought to those days. Life wasn't just red-white-and-blue bunting and paper napkins then. There are a 
thousand books I suppose, written and being written about our colonial beginnings. What they wore, what they ate, those aristocrats of our early days. And without waiting another
minute I may tell you that they did themselves well. Such royal Dresden china, such superb linens, the magnificence of their mahogany...Menu: Ham Whets 
ham salad on toast canapes], Broiled Salmon, Sauce Verte, Pease, Watermelon Pickles, Pickled Walnuts, Whigs, 
Geranium Jelly, Dressed Saad, Blancmange With Fruit, Poundcake, Tea."<br>

“Traditional food for the Fourth of July feast varies somewhat in different parts of the country. The correct menu in some parts of New England, particularly around 
Boston, is fresh salmon, new peas and potatoes. Strawberry shortcake is served for dessert. In the Midwest, when we were growing up there, the big ice cream freezer
 (operated by boys or man power) was put into use on the Fourth. Ice had been cut from the pond during the winter and stored in sawdust in our own icehouse and we
 made ice cream for the first time on Independence Day. Long tables were set up on the lawn for this early summer family festival. Great platters of crisp fried chicken, baked ham from our smokehouse, big bowls of pale, green coleslaw, stuffed eggs, and mother’s finest coconut layer cake all were certain to appear.”<br>

“Watermelon is, as usual, a Fourth-of-July special for this week-end. Nut there won’t be as much of the fruit around as there was a year ago. The Florida season, which started early this spring, is about over the Georgia and South Carolina, now the principal sources, report crops as much as 50 per cent smaller than those of last summer…One of the most plentiful varieties on the market is the Tom Watson. It’s Maple green in color, and shaped like an overgrown sausage.”<br>

“Fourth of July was a day for community celebration till the automobile broke up the crowd and hurried each family away for its own private partying. The gathering used to be big; so was the menu and, apparently, the appetites. Forty-five years ago today, at the first Independence Day dinner of Atlantic City’s new Traymore Hotel, guests sat down to a meal that stands in colossal contrast to the sandwich-with-beer of today’s picnic. Somewhat abbreviated, the bill of fare follows—and do not ask this column how Blue Point oysters and venison were procured in July:<br>
Choice of: Blue point oysters, Little neck clams, Cream soup, Consomme, Olives, Radishes, Nuts, Choice of: Filet of sole, Smoked tongue, Choice of: Roast beef, Roast lamb, Roast duck, Potatoes, Carrots, Choice of: Venison, Soft-shell crabs, Punch, Squab, Sliced tomatoes, Lettuce, Choice of : Steamed pudding, Huckleberry pie, Orange cream pie, Fruits, Cheese, Wafers, Coffee.<br>

“It’s the custom in New England to serve cold salmon steaks on the Fourth of July. No one know where it started, or why, but the custom is spreading to all parts of the country. Perhaps the color was responsible, but we think it more likely that it’s because salmon fishing is at its height in July.”<br>

“Declare your independence from plain fare this year. Serve a fancy broiled steak with a tangy sauce. Juicy, thick, broiled steak will make any Uncle Sam doff his high silk hat. It’s the No. 1 choice for cook-outs…corn runs a close second. If there’s enough of these two foods, very little else needs to be added to keep everyone on a Fourth of July picnic as happy as a firecracker. The steak-out menu pictured—2 inch-thick steaks on the charcoal grill, fresh corn on the cob in the blue bowl, and assorted raw relished, is the kind of picnic men like. They like to cook it as well as to eat it. So, if you’re planning a family get-together for the Fourth, plant, plan a steak-out. See if the head of the house doesn’t volunteer his services as chief cook. And if he needs any pointers, you can brief him on the secrets of success of any steak-out—thick-cut steaks, proper seasonings and the right kind of fire. Porterhouse, sirloin, rib or club steaks are all good for outdoor open-fire cooking. Some of the less expensive cuts, such as prime grade top round and rump, will come out quite well if they are marinated. Allow ¾ to 1 pound of steak per person for hearty appetites. And have steaks cut thick for broiling. A lemon butter sauce, its rich flavor heightened by the addition of Tabasco’s subtle pepper piquancy, makes a perfect spread for steak, and it goes equally well with corn…”<br>

"What's more fun than a Fourth of July picnic? Two Fourth of July picnics--one for the adults and one for the children! Most small-fry like to eat picnic chow seated on a spot of shady grass, unhampered by knife, fork or spoon.
But by the time people are mommies or daddies, a chair is mightly comfortable and finger-food has lost a lot of appeal. So if you're planning a large picnic for family and friends
this Fourth, why not divide the youngsters from the oldesters. Pack box lunches for the children and send them down to that big shade tree at the far end of the 
garden. Serve the adults, buffet style, on the terrace. That's what the 
Shoreham Hotel is doing Saturday, at its picnic for some 150 house-party guests...Since an old fashioned, grand and glorious Fourth picnic was never complete without 
fried chicken, executive chef, Edward Dziura has made it thee main item for
both picnic menus. And since Hawaii is receiving a special salute (along with Alaska) at the Fourth of July fireworks display at Washington Monument, Eddie says his 
fried chicken--and a few other dishes on the picnic menu--will
go Hawaiian...there will be deviled eggs, ham sandwiches, tuna fish sandwiches, apples and bananas...a large crock of pink lemonade...a tray of cup-cakes iced in red, white and blue, and arranged in the shape of a flag...
On the buffet, will be large platters of Fried Chicken Hawaiian, and Corn Fritters, Island Style; Shoreham Potato Salad--nothing Hawaiian about that but what's a picnic without potato salad--Boston lettuce, tomato and cucumber 
salad with a choice of dressings; and Dessert Polynesian."<br>

“London, July 4—It was just like a Fourth of July back home, almost! The American sergeants who run Douglas house, a club for enlisted airmen in London, wondered if some of their 50,000 mates in Britain might be homesick for a real Independence day picnic. They started asking and soon 8,000 names were on the list. So the sergeants borrowed, from London county council, Battersea gardens with its amusement park, or ‘fun fair’ as the English call it. They ran up Old Glory over the entrance and put a big sign saying ‘chow’ over the biggest tea pavilion. They scattered 8,000 balloons about. There were star spangled paper hats and tiny American flags. They rolled in trucks with 21,000 hot dobs, a little less than a ton of potato salad, and almost as much baked beans. They roasted sides of beef and park. They borrowed the air force’s biggest refrigerated truck and filled it with 21,600 cans of American beer. At noon they threw open the gates. In an hour and a half, 8,000 had arrived and still they came. The sergeantsrushed back for new supplies. American airmen came from all over England. They brought their wives, children, aunts, and dogs. A band played. In little groups the families spread over the lawn. They talked and ate and slept. The kids ran about. They all rode the ferris wheel and had fun on the roller coaster even though it was called the big dipper…Yes, it was almost like a Fourth of July picnic back home, except there was no ball game, the amplified music was interrupted now and then for cricket scores, and O, the shame of it all—on the top of the pole from which old glory flaunted its 50 stars so proudly was a golden royal English crown.”<br>

"One of the fascinating aspects of charcoal cookery is the undaunted zest with which most outdoor chefs approach their task. The man who normally shuns pots and pans and who
couldn't find the pilot light on a gas range achieves a ramrod self-assurance standing before a backyard brazier The irony is that charcoal grilling, in theory at least, has far
more variables than a kitchen range. But with all its pitfalls a sturdy firebox is the greater adventure, aand it is reasonable to assume that more charcoal will be burned this 
Fourth of July weekend than in any other comparable period of the year. Popular grilling depends on many factors, and it is best done on a spot well sheltered from the
wind. Food cooks slowly or rapidly, depending on the itensity of the charcoal heat and the priximity of the coals to the food. But whatever the factors and whatever the 
results--and heaven knows they vary from grill to grill--the out-of-doors does whet the appetite. Even burnt offerings seem to have something going for them. Here is a sampling of recipes
 for Indpendence Day weekend. There are drinks and appetizers and two for the grill--striped bass with rosemary and a chili-flavored hamburger."<br>

"A Fourth of July picnic is as traditional as Uncle Sam's striped trousers. Ever since July 4, 1776 when the Continental Congress approved the signing of the Declaration of 
Independence in Philadelphia, palate-pleasing collations have been as much a part of the festivities as parades, patriotic speeches and pyrotechnics...This year's Honor America Day 
celebration in the Nation's Capital will feature Dr. Billy Graham, Bob Hope, a Walt Disney production, band concerts and a display of fireworks on the Washington monument
grounds...good food is a must for the Fourth. Why not plan both an indoor and outdoor meal? Then you'll be ready for rain or shine...Grilled Dill Steak is a new and
easy-to-prepare variation. A 2-inch-thick slice of top raound or flank steak (London Broil) is marinated overnight in a tanngy sauce of sliced dill pickles, olive oil, 
garlic and pickle liquid...Served with baked potatoes or corn on the cob (wrapped in foil and grilled over the charcoal), and plenty of pungent pickles cut into 
fan-shape with 
inserts of thinly sliced carrots, this meal will pamper palates. Or if smoke gets in your eyes and you prefer a porch or patio picnic, try our alternate choice: Planked Beef 
Fiesta. This is just ground beef patties glamorized with bright toppings and duchess potatoes. Vegetable cole slaw with creamy dressing, buttered green beans, french bread and

fresh salmon and green peas from some dim Fourth in the past. The 1971 fried chicken menu beats any picnic for ease...But for the picnic host or hostess who likes to cook or is

"No matter what the weather is like on this coming Fourth of July, I am planning a picnic. Needless to say, I have made that kind of declarative statement in the past and usually
ended up cracking open the deviled eggs and uncorking a thermos of gazpacho on my shaggy living room rug, when Mother Nature had other ideas on the subject. This Independence Day...
I am determined to dine alfresco even if it means dragging alog an inflatable life raft instead of a blanket and supplying umbrellas for every member of the party. I 
suspect I came to their prediction for eating in forest ladies and meadows by inheritance. My father who was by no stretch of the imagination a naturalist, relished open-air
meals. Say cookout or barbecue, and his taste buds instantly flowered. Indeed, before the Depression sapped his social inclinations, I suspect he joined all the fraternal
orgaizations he was conned with...just to get a crack at the lodge picnics these various organizations gave on national holidays...These outings usually took place in some
lakeside glen or wooded camp, a good half-day's ride from our home in Queens. To a chronically carsick kid (like me) that journey was an ordeal..When it was almost time
for food, the be-fezzed bretheren (and their captive famlilies) would crcam together at long trestle tables. Stationed there, the lodge members drank enormous quantities of
beer and sang off-key and off-color songs...Vast platters of gilded chicken and rosy beef, cheek by jowl with lobsters, clams, osters and so shell crabs. And...at
either end were porringers of pickled beets, potato salad, coleslaw and a sizzling pot of sugar-crusted baked beans. Fare for a regiment, it was demolished by everyone but
me. The finicky eater (then, not now), I would deight to eat only a peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich, wax-paper wrapped and brought from home..."<br>

“Chicken is one of the most versatile meats for light summer eating. The 4th of July can be celebrated in an Oriental fashion with these chicken breasts that have been marinated in fresh lemon juice, ginger and soy sauce. They may be cooked on the grill if you wish. Served with a bed of rice laced with crunchy green vegetables and juicy broiled tomatoes, this menu could be served for a casual company dinner.”<br>

“A recent lunch at the Four Seasons restaurant in New York City inspired this menu for the 4th of July. The main course is similar to a hamburger patty but it’s jazzed up by using ground lamb instead of beef and by adding pine nuts and lemon rind. Instead of the usual mustard and catsup accompaniments, the restaurant serves a spicy chutney similar to the one that follows. Plenty of thick, toasted French bread slices can be served with the burgers to soak up the delicious juices. The corkscrew noodles are mixed with red, yellow and green peppers that are cooked to a crisp-tender stage. The peppers give this simple pasta dish a truly festive flair.”<br>

“The year was 1916, the place Coney Island,. Beneath the blazing Fourth of July sun, a crew of gastronomic pioneers gathered to launch the first Nathan’s hot dog 
eating contest. The winner, Jim Mullen, lives only in hot dog history—but 83 years later, his legacy endures. Nathan’s annual holiday chowdown survives as the

 cream, or rigs and cola cake?...Choose the food: Easy now. With sparklers to light, this is no time to fuss in the kitchen. Consider baked beans you don’t have to 
bake. Or tap into a versatile marinade that goes with whatever your pleasure: ribs, chicken, or pork roast. Too complicated? Hot dogs’ll do because frankly, franks 
are just perfect for the Fourth. Choose a recipe or two, then fill in the rest with easy options like potato chips and ice cream. This holiday is all about 
independence, so do it your own way.”<br>
