The tradition of proferring offerings of love on St. Valentine's Day is well documented. The role
of exchanging confections on this day is not. Some folks believe chocolate is the confection of choice because of its 
aphrodesiac properties. Others reason the Valentine candy
phenomenon a just a clever scheme developed by confectioners to promote products in the seasonal lull between Christmas
and Easter. No matter what the reason, the end result is lovely and delicious! 
<p>
The two candies most associated with Valentines Day in America are <a href="valentines.html#conversationhearts">Conversation Hearts</a> and
<a href="valentines.html#valentineschocolate">chocolate</a>. Fancy <a href="valentines.html#valentinesboxes">heart-shaped packaging</a>, like Valentines
cards, evolved from Victorian traditions.
<p>
<a name="conversationhearts">
<b>Conversation hearts</b><br>
Converation Hearts, as we Americans know them today, descended from British Conversation Lozenges and 
<a href="foodcandy.html#mottorock">
Motto Rocks</a>. These have been popular confections 
from the mid-19th century forwards. In older times words were sometimes imprinted by molds or inserted (paper) into the confection.

Why do we give chocolate on Valentine's Day?</b><br>
 Some folks believe chocolate is given because it's an aphrodesiac. <a href="valentines.html#cadbury">Cadbury's</a> is often cited as one
of the first companies to promote this holiday practice.

<p>
<a name="valentinesboxes">
Confectionery historians confirm <a href="foodcandy.html#packaging">special packaging</a> has been employed for candy
for hundreds of years.
The earliest reference we find in American print to Valentine's Day confections packed in fancy heart-shaped boxes is from
 the 1890s:
<p>
"Among the sweetest valentines seen were those designed by the confectioners. Some shown in beautiful glass-covered boxes were 
heart shape, the foundation being a layer of pale pink cream confectionery, half an inch thick, edged all around with candied
rose leaves in clusters to represent tiny roses. Included in this flowery frame was a smaller heart formed of a solid mass of the
rose leaves, and surrounding it were the words, in raised letters, covered with gold leaf, "For my valentine." The box, into which the
lovely confection exactly fitted, was of pink satin, the rim around the glass top being covered with a narrow row of finely-plaited
pink silk net. In this dainty casket the valentine can be preserved for generations, if so desired, or, if consumed, the case will
serve as a charming receptable for jewels. Others, similary designed, were of candied violets, in violet satin boxes. An exquisitely
delicate one, that shows the confectioner's art in its highest development, resembled a delicate bisque piece in coloring and finish.
In the centre of a square of lemon-colored cream, bordered with ale green primroses, were two figures, one of a bewitching 
little girl in a Greenaway gown and a huge hat loaded with white ostrich tips, and the other a boy in a picturesuqe Continental suit,
standing before her, cocked hat in hand, in the act of making an elaborate bow. The faces and dresses are wonderfully well done, and
every particle of the whole is composed of the very choicest candy. On the right, in gold letters, are the words, "Will you 
be my valentine?" Their values range from $5 upward, including box, those with the figures being, of course, higher priced than 
th others and they make a far more sensible gift than gold-plated bonbons at $40 a pound, which are a caprice just now with the ultra
fashionables."
---"In Honor of St. Valentine," <i>New York Times</i>, February 4, 1894 (p. 18)

"Valentine Candy Boxes---All in heart shape, in numerous pretty colored designs. Filled with chocolate drops. Were 40 cents each, now
25 cents."---Display ad, John Wanamaker's, <i>New York Times</i>, February 12, 1901 (p. 4)
<p>
<a name="cadbury">
<b>The Cadbury connection?</b> <p>
"The tradition of giving chocolates on Valentine's Day can be traced to Richard Cadbury, of the
English chocolate-making family, who "invented" the first Valentine's Day candy box during the
Victorian era. The Victorians, who fancied decorating cards with plump cupids shooting arrows
of love, later transferred the image to the lids of heart-shaped boxes filled with dreamy
combinations of silken chocolates."<br>
---"For Lovers, Chocolate," Niki Dwyer, <i>The Buffalo News</i>, February 11, 1998,
Lifestyles (p. 2D)
<p>
Cadbury itself acknowledges making fancy boxes of chocolates, though it stakes no claims on
Valentine's Day:<p>
"Cadbury's 'fancy chocolates' (or assortments) were sold in decorated boxes with small
pictures that children could cut out to stick into scrapbooks.
Richard Cadbury, who had considerable artistic talents, set out to introduce more ambitious
and attractive designs from his own paintings: many of his original boxes still exist. Using his
own
children as models, or depicting flowers and scenes from holiday journeys, he introduced the first
British made fancy chocolate boxes. These proved to be popular, helping both the Cadbury
business and the confectionery trade in general.
Elaborate chocolate boxes were prized by the late Victorians as special gifts, to be used as
trinket or button boxes once the fancy chocolates had been eaten: designs therefore had after-use
very much in mind. Designs ranged from superb velvet covered caskets with bevelled mirrors
and
silk lined jewel boxes, to pretty boxes with pictures of kittens, landscapes or attractive girls on
the
lid.
Their popularity continued until their disappearance during the 1939-45 war: Victorian and
Edwardian chocolate boxes are now treasured collectors' items.
In the 1870s the quality of the chocolates produced by the company following the introduction
of the cocoa press helped Cadbury break the monopoly French producers previously enjoyed in
the British market."<br>

Below please find historic USA Valentine's Day menus. They are few & far between. Most of them are constructed by color (pink, red) or shape (heart, cupid). Why? In the USA, Valentine's Day is not a major eating holiday. It centers on

"The heart motif prevails for Valentine's Day. Heart-shaped brownies, cookies, cakes, tarts and so forth dominate the dessert menu. In the main-dish department there
are many options, from baking a heart-sgaped pizza to sculpturing a filet mignon into the shape of a heart. Cut ravioli into a heart shape or bake heart-shaped biscuits
to go with the chicken. Somewhat less obvious but just as appropriate are dishes involving hearts of artichokes or hearts of palm. Oysters are also high on the list of
Vaentine possibiities because of their supposed aphrodesiac properties. Passion fruit sounds like a good idea even though the name comes not from the romantic passion, 
but from the Christian passion at Eastertime. But it also pays to remember that another name for the tomato is the love apple. Here are a few possibilities for the 
Valentine menu. Salad of Cherry Tomatoes and Hearts of Palm...Risotto with Artichoke Hearts...Coeur a la Creme with Passion Fruit Sauce."<br>
