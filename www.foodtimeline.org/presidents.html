19th century gastronomer Jean-Anthelme Brillat-Savarin observed "Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you who  you are."  Indeed, there is no better measure of
personal taste than the food one eats. Literally and figuratively.
<p>
What our presidents eat is a function family heritage, personal preference, physical
  condition and social obligation. In sum: a president's favorite meal is NOT always what's served in the White House.
Why? Because this is a public place and meals are required to meet certain standards. Often a
president's favorite food is a simple dish enjoyed in childhood. These personal tidbits are 
generally not *worth* reporting in history books. Foods consumed privately (most often breakfast, or
with the family) are the generally the best reflections of personal preference.<p>
Each of our presidents presents a unique gastronomic portrait. Some were gourmets relishing classic French cuisine (Jefferson, Kennedy); others were
"down home" simple eaters (Adams, Johnson). Presidents have viewed food as fuel (Lincoln, Wilson); opportunities for cultural exchange (Nixon, FDR); or
medical encumberance (Garfield).
<p>
What we know about First Family food preferences is gleaned from primary documents (cookbooks, letters, journals), chef notes,
and household ledgers. With few notable exceptions, presidential food favorites are rarely recorded by biographers.

<font color="#003366" size=+1>George Washington</font><p>
 George Washington is often associated with <a href="presidents.html#gwcherries">cherries</a> (cherry tree, cherry pie etc.). According to
 his biographers, our first president did, indeed, love cherries. He also loved a wide variety of
 fruits, nuts, and fish. He preferred simple meals over fancy ones. George Washington's home
 (<a href="http://www.mountvernon.org">
Mount Vernon</a>) was completely self-sufficient. It had extensive farms, orchards, meat
 preservation facilities (to make ham, bacon, etc) and animals. Family recipes were recorded in Martha Washington's 
<i>Booke of Cookery</i> (recently reprinted by Columbia University Press).
<p>
 "George Washington's own eating habits were relatively simple. One observer of the time said
 that he "took what came with philosophy"; certainly no one could accuse our first President of
 having been a gourmet. Custis, Martha Washington's grandson, described Washington's food
 preferences: "He ate heartily, but was not  particular in his diet, with the exception of fish, of
 which he was excessively fond. He partook sparingly of dessert, drank a home-made
 beverage, and from four to five glasses of Madeira wine"...A special passion of the
 President's was nuts. He would buy hazelnuts and shellbacks by the barrel...Food reflects the
 man. In Washington, there is the interesting dichotomy of a man disinterested in the refinements
 of the table, yet anxious to offer as many refinements as possible to his guests, simple in his own
 tastes but generous toward others...As food reflects the man, it also reflects the times. The food
 served at the President's table from 1789 to the end of Washington's second term, 1797,
 indicates the new nation's dependence on the land. Game, fowl, meats, plantation-grown fuits
 and vegetables, fish from local rivers of the Atlantic reveal the abundance of the land. Spliced
 throughout the menus are the remnants of Washington's English heritage--puddings, cream
 trifles, and taste for port and wine."<br>
 ---<i>The Presidents' Cookbook</i>, Poppy Cannon and Patricia Brooks [Funk & Wagnalls:New York]
 1968 (p. 8-9) <br>[NOTE: This book has many pages about Washington's food and dining habits. It
 also includes modernized recipes with history notes. If you need more information ask your
 librarian to help you find this book.]
<p>
"Washington said: "My manner of living is plain, and I do not mean to be put out by it. A glass of wine and a bit on mutton are 
always welcome. Those who expect more will be disappointed." This, however, is an example of the "plain living" offered guests
at a Presidential dinner: There was an elegant variety of roast beef, veal, turkey, ducks, fowls, hams, etc.; puddings, jellies, oranges,
apples, nuts, almonds, figs, raisins, and a variety of wines and punch [one guest observed]."<br>
---ibid (p. 2)
<p>
"Breakfast seems to have been the only meal in the Presidential house that was relaxed. At least the report of Henry Wansey, and 
English manufacturer, who had breakfast with the President and his family on June 8, 1794, indicates this to be so: "Mrs.
Washington made tea and coffee for them; on the table there were two small plates of sliced tongues and dry toast, bread and butter,
but no broiled fish, as is generally the custom. Miss Eleanor Custis, her granddaughter, in her sixteenth year, sat next to
her, and next, her grandson, George Washington Parke Custis, two years older. There were but few of form; one servant only sttended
who wore no livery."<br>

<b>What about the cherry tree?</B><br>
George Washington's cherry tree chopping story has long been debunked by historians as nationalistic myth. Not unsimilar to the mid-19th century accounts detailing the first thanksgiving feast. A nation divided needed to forge a unified history if it was going to survive. It worked. Or we would not be here discussing this today. 
Cherries were well known in the Old World. Recipes for them (preserves, pies, tarts, wine) were familiar to early Americans. 
<i>Martha Washington's Booke of Cookery</i> (transcribed by Karen Hess) contains several instructions for 
preserving cherries, in the English culinary tradition. It does not offer any recipes for cherry pie or cake.
<p>
According to the fruit experts at the <a href=" http://www.uga.edu/fruit/cherry.html">University of Georgia</a>: 
 "Sweet cherries came to the USA with English Colonists in 1629, and later were 
introduced to California by Spanish Missionaries. In the 1800's sweet cherries were moved west by pioneers and fur traders to their major sites of production in 
Washington, Oregon, and California. Cultivars selected at that time still form the base of the industry today." 
<p>
John Bartram's famous <i>Catalogue of American Plants</i> circa 1783 contains several references to 18th century American cherries 
<blockquote>
Prunus Padus Sylvatica [Virginiana]...Bird or Cluster Cherry <br>
Prunus Racemosa...Dwarf Bird Cherry <br>
Prunus Pumila...Sand cherry <br>
Prunus Serotina...Black cherry <br>

<b>What was served at the first State Dinner, May 29, 1789?</b><br>
We may never know. Details abound regarding General Washington's first presidential residence in New York City. Only a scant
description from a guest survives about this first national meal. We do know the dinner at was held at the executive mansion, No. 10 Cherry Street, New York City, Thursday, May 29, 1789. It was a small, informal dinner served family style. We find no evidence of a menu or bill of fare. The only description of the meal we find was reccorded by one of the attendees, Mr. Wingate of New Hampshire. The only food he mentions is boiled leg of mutton. We can surmise subsequent repasts were better equipped. The retainer of one Samuel Fraunces assured that result.
<p>
"Thursday, May 28. At New York: "New York, May 30.--Although The Preseident makes no formal invitation, yet the day after the arrival of Mrs. Washington, the following
 distinguished personages dined at his house, en famille. --Their Excellencies the Vice-President--the Governor of this State--the Ministers of France and Spain--and the 
Governor of the Western Territory--the Hon. Secretary of the United States for Foreign Affairs--the Most. Hon. Mr. Langdon, Mr. Wingate, Mr. Izard, Mr. Few, and Mr. 
Muhlenberg, Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States."--Gazette of the United States. Pain Wingate, Senator from New Hampshire, one of the
 guests has left the following description of this dinner: "It was the least showy dinner that I ever say at the President's. As there was no clergyman present, Washington
 himself said grace on taking his seat. He dined on a boiled leg of mutton, as it was his custom to eat of only one dish. After the dessert a single glass of wine was offered
 to each of the guests, when the President rose, the guests following his example, and repaired to the drawing-room, each departing at his option, without ceremony."<br>
---<i>Washington After the Revolution</i>, William Spohn Baker [J.B. Lippincott Company:Philadelphia] 1898 (p. 138)
<p>
<b>General Washington's Thursday dinners:</b><p> 
"The Thursday dinners,...were served at three in the afternoon, to from ten to twenty-two guests. At the central table, laid exquisitely in fine linen, was a long mirror, made
 in sections and framed in silved, on which stood china statuettes. The silverware which had been melted down and reproduced in more elegant style with each piece 
displaying the arms of the Washington family, and a small bead edge around the rim, adorned the table. Roast beef, veal, lamb, turkey and duck, and varieties of wild
 game, in which Manhattan Island then abounded, with jelly, fruit, nuts and raisns, were on the table before the guests made their entrance. Mrs. Washington sat at one
 end of the table and the President's secretary, Tobias Lear, at the other. In the cenyer of one side sat the president himself. After the meal the President would raise his
 wine glass. All would drink a toast, and the ladies would retire to the drawing-room. leaving the men to their after dinner indulgences. The Washingtons served good wine, 
but ordinarily a silver mug of beer stood beside the President's plate, except at state dinners. An invitation to dinner was not regarded as a command, and there were
 instances of regrets being sent for one reason or another. Half a dozen or more servants were in attendance at these dinners, in the white and scarlet livery of the 
Washington household. It is said that both the President and Mrs. Washington had a keen sense of the dignity of the position which they filled."<r>
---<i>History of George Washington: Bicentennial Celebration</i>, Volume III Literature Series [George Washington Bicentennial Commission:Washington DC] 1932 (p. 280)
<p>
"With Martha's arrival the social pattern of the President's duties was established. The formal diners began at 4 P.M., and there was no waiting for unpunctual guests. If no
 clergyman was present, Washington himself said grace. In a mixed company , the President and his lady sat across from each other, halfway down the long table, with a
 secretary at the head and the foot, to aid the serving and the conversation...Fraunces, in a dazzling white apron, white silk shirt and stockings, velvet breeches, and
 powder in his hair, presided in the dining room and placed the dishes on the table, uncovered, while the carving and helping were mostly done by the secretaries. When 
the ladies retired to the drawing room it was Washington's habit to follow them after fifteen minutes for coffee, leaving one of the secretaries to entertain the gentlemen who
 wished to linger over the wine. If there were no other ladies present, Martha sat at the head of the table, with a secretary at the food, and the President half way betwen.
 For the family meals they reverted to the side-by-side chairs at the head of the table, with a carver at the food."<br>
---<i>Washington's Lady</i>, Elworth Thane [Dodd, Mead:Nwe York] 1960  (p. 281-282)
<p?
<b>Entertainment, Washington style, NYC<p>
"[May 1-July 4, 1789) Washington's first task was not to ascertain his duties but to find time in which to discharge those awaiting him...These were duties of varying 
complexity but the least difficult of them would demand hours on hours of work every week and some would require long attention daily; how could this be given? If visitors
 were being ushered endlessly into the house all day, and the President went out every evening to return calls or to appear at civic entertainments, would not the public
 service suffer fatally and he, himself, disappoint popular expectation? The rule to receive "visits of compliment" on two designated says of the week and then for an hour 
only was made effective forthwith. Invitations to dinner in the President's House, which usually was served at 3 o'clock, had not been issued between the date of 
Washington's arrival in New York and that of the assumption of office. It was decided to make no exception to this rule for the time being, though Lear, on reaching the
 city, had hired “Black Sam” Fraunces as steward. The former proprietor of the tavern where Washington had said farewell to his officers, ‘tossed off such a number of fine 
dishes,’ according to Lear, “that we are distracted in our choice when we sit down to table, and obliged to hold a long consultation on the subject before we can determine
 what to attack.” Although it seemed bad to leave these viands untouched while members of Congress were eating poor meals at noisy taverns, the General’s tentative 
decision to do no entertaining at dinner was approved and perhaps as promoted by old Federal lawmakers of taste and by conspicuous New Yorkers.”<br>
---<i>George Washington</i>, Douglas Southall Freeman, Volume VI: Patriot and President, 1784-1793 [Charles Scribner's Sons:New York] 1954 (p. 199-200)
<p>
"It was life as far removed as decent existence could be from the routine of Mount Vernon...To be sure, there were at least two embarrassing situations. In one of them, 
the General had made arrangements to entertain guests at the afternoon meal on the 28th, the day after Martha's arrival; but perhaps because the servants were confused,
 the affair was neglected. Senator Paine Wingate, like the General, did not consider himself particularly "nice," but even he wrote: "It was the least showy dinner that I ever
 saw at the President's...After the dessert a single glass of wine was offered to each of the guests, when the President rose, the guests following his example, and
 repaired to the drawing-room, each departing at his option, without ceremony. Martha's activity and experience changed all that. Before the summer was over, a
 none-too-friendly Senator was to write of a meal at her table, "It was a great dinner, and the best of the kind I ever was at." <br>
---<i>George Washington</i>, Douglas Southall Freeman, Volume VI: Patriot and President, 1784-1793 [Charles Scribner's Sons:New York] 1954 (p. 211)
<p>
“Despite the restriction of the invitations to officials the dinners could be gay, since such of Washington’s favorite friends as Knox and Robert Morris held office. He often
 tried to leaven a lump and create a party more like those at Mount Vernon by inviting…not only the elders but grownup sons, daughters, and daughters-in-law…The 
president and Mrs. Washington sat opposite each other in the middle of the dinner table, the ladies being ranged on both sides of Martha, the gentlemen opposite them on 
both sides of George…The dinner began with “soup, fish, roasted and boiled meats, gammon, fowls, etc…The dessert was first apple pies, pudding, etc., then iced 
creams, jellies, etc., then watermelons, muskmelons, apples, peaches, nuts.”…the food was eaten in solemn silence…”<br>

<p>
<b>The Samuel Fraunces connection?</b><p>
"Perhaps thae most telling glimpse of Samuel Fraunces' character is gleaned from an exploration of his relationship with George Washington. Like many other 
Americans, Fraunces respected and revered Washington. Their relationship was ever one of master and servant; however, Washington clearly respected Fraunces'
 abilities as a manager and early in their acquaintance relied on him to select sundries such as china and glassware for his household and to recommend servants, 
particularly cooks and stewards. Washington used the [Fraunces] tavern when he gave his famous farewell speech to his officers on December 4, 1783. Fraunces, 
on the other hand, did not hesitate in the years before he joined the President's staff, especially as his monetary situation worsened, to exploit their friendship...
Motivated by a downturn in his personal finances, Fraunces joined the first President's staff as his chief steward...Fraunces also selected food for Washington's
 table and supervised its preparation. Washington, however, was not completely satisfied with Fraunces' performance, and he noted the steward's "taste for the high 
life," to which Washington did not object as long as expenses were kept low. The President entertained frequently, and it is no wonder that Fraunces was not able
 to stay within his budget. Washington, however, wanted to avoid projecting a royal image to the public and politicians. The President also complained that his 
servants were eating as well as he, and the two men appear to have had at least one disagreement over the serving of wine at the servants' table. Fraunces worked
 for Washington in New York for less than one year (May 1789 to February 1790) and the was discharged. Washington later admitted, "I have entertained much
 harder thoughts of the latter [Fraunces] than I might have done. After the Federal government moved to Philadelphia in 1790, Samuel Fruances rejoined 
Washington's household. Fraunces apparently never intended to return to New York."<br>

  appreciated a variety of cuisines and fine foods, which they enjoyed while living in
  other cities (Paris, London, New York, Philadelphia). Although well versed in elegant
  entertaining, we are told Mr. and Mrs. Adams generally served simple dinners at the
  White House. Menus often included of their New England favorites. This was due
  mostly to the fact that the White house was *brand new.*
  <p>
  
  "Of course it was imperative that there be some official celebration of the opening of
  the new Executive Mansion...Finally plans were completed, and the big reception was
  scheduled for New Year's Day, 1801. This was the day the White House was formally
  opened to the public. The preparations were elaborate. This was the Adamses' most
  lavish reception...Tea, coffee, punch, and wine were served. There were also cakes
  and tarts, all baked in the new ovens on either side of the enormous kitchen fireplace.
  In addition, curds, creams, trifles, jellies, floating island, syllabub, sweetmeats, and
  assorted fruits graced the tables and were passed among the guests...Everything after
  the New Year's Day reception was anticlimactic. Because of the short time left in
  office, the Adamses did little formal entertaining...The dining habits of the [John
  Adams] presidential family were relatively simple, at least by Virginia standards.
  Menus were based largely on the couple's New England heritage, which differed
  considerably from the Southern heritage of Washington....The net result was a plainer
  cuisine. John Adams noted in his diary that his guests were served dinners that
  consisted of Indian pudding, molasses, and butter as a first course, veal, bacon, neck
  of mutton and vegetables as a second...However, the Adamses' wide experience in
  Paris and London and later in social Philadelphia, and their exposure to the Southern
  cuisine of the Washingtons and others, gave them a taste and respect for a more
  varied diet. It may well have been Abigail's determined economy that limited their
  menus, for John noted in his diary several dinners worthy of comment. Adams
  described at the home of Miers Fisher, a young Quaker lawyer: "This plain Friend,
  with his plain but pretty wife with her Thees and Thous, had provided us a costly
  entertainment: ducks, hams, chickens, beef, pig, tarts, creams, custards, jellies, fools
  trifles, floating islands, beer, porter, punch, wine." Another time Adams saw fit to
  mention the quality of a meal at the home of Chief Justice Chew, describing it wryly:
  "About four o'clock we were called to dinner. Turtle and every other thing, flummery,
  jellies, sweetmeats of twenty sorts, trifles, whipped syllabubs, floating islands, fools,
  etc., with a dessert of fruits, raisins, almonds, pears, peaches. A most sinful feast
  again! Everything which would delight the eye or allure the taste...Parmesan cheese,
  punch, wine, porter, beer." The ironic intent of "a most sinful feast" suggestst that
  Adams was not averse to rich foods. One suspects that Abigail's eye on that $25,000
  [John Adam's presidential salary]  accounted for the more mundane menus at home."<br>

<b>"Apple Pan Dowdy</b><br>
Apples, like molasses, were a standby in New England Desserts. John Adams showed his preference for Apple Pan Dowdy by having it on 
Independence Day...<br>

To make the pastry: Sift 1 1/2 cups flour with a dash of salt. Blend in 1/2 cup shortening until the mixture is mealy. Sprinkle a little ice
water over the mixture, just enough to hold the dough together. Roll the pastry out, brush with 1/4 cup melted butter, and cut pastry in 
half. Place the halves on top of each other and cut again. Repeat until you have 16 separate but equal pieces of pastry piled on top of
each other, then chill them a full hour. Roll the pastry once again, cut in half, and line the bottom of the baking dish with one half. Save the other
half for the top. Keep both on ice while making the filling.
<p>
To make the filling: Mix 1/2 cup sugar with 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Peel and core 10 large
apples. Cut then into thin slices. Mix the apples with sugar-spice mixture and place in pastry-lined dish. Combine 1/2 cup
molasses (or maple syrup) with 3 tablespoons melted butter and 1/4 cup water. Pour this over the apples. Cover with the top pastry
layer and seal. Place in a preheated hot (400 degree F.) oven for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to low (325 degrees F.). After 
reducing the heat, "dowdy" the dish by cutting the crust into the apples with a sharp knife. Return dish to oven and bake a full
hour. Serve hot with vanilla ice cream or with heavy cream or whipped cream. Serves 6."<br>

<font color="#003366" size=+1>Thomas Jefferson</font><p>
Gourmet, scientist, traveler, farmer, diplomat: our third President was truly a Renaissance man. Biographers confirm Jefferson's
love for native foods and passion for foreign fare. Jefferson's tables, both public and private, reflected his love for
culinary adventure. 
<p>
"Many of [Jefferson's] innovations are today an accepted part of our national diet...[he had an] adventurous palate and active interest
in a wide range of foods...In his four years in Paris he sampled widely French cuisine, making copious notes of dishes he liked
so he could serve them back home...In Holland he sampled waffles for the first time and was so pleased he immedately bought a
waffle iron...A particular tea in Amsterdam appealed to him; he bought some to take along. In Nancy it was chocolate that
caught his fancy, and in southern France he made notes on the differences in oranges in various communities he visited...Notes
made on a visit to Rozzano included details of butter- and Parmesan cheese-making. He tasted a frozen delicacy and observed that 
"snow vives the most delicate flavor to creams, but ice is the most powerful congealer and lasts longer." Like many a traveler
returning home, Jefferson missed the dishes to which he had become accustomed. To his valet returning after him he sent a
request for him to "bring a stock of macaroni, Parmesan cheese, figs of Marseilles...raisins, almonds, mustard...vinegar,
oil and anchovies."...President Jefferson was particularly addicted to intricate dishes and brought back from Paris...His bouilli,
daubes, ragouts, gateaux, souffles, ices, sauces, and wine cookery...Jefferson confessed a preference for French cooking "because the
meats were more tender."...He as especially fond of fresh vegetables and kept a careful chart of the season when certain ones would
be available in the local market...A gourmet...Jefferson ate lightly...He preferred vegetables to meats and was particularly
fond of olives, figs, mulberries, crabs, shad, oysters, partridge, venison, pineapple, and light wines. He was a connoisseur s
well of delicate French pastries, souffles, light cakes...His table drinks were cider and malt drinks...his greatest field of 
expertise was wine...the president's favorite wine was Madeira..."<br>

"Despite his fondness for French cookery, Jefferson retained his liking for sweet potatoes, turnip grees, baked shad, Virginia

Paris garden. His kitchen garden at Monticello contained a variety of vegetables including his favorite peas, of which he was

<font color="#003366" size=+1>James Madison</font><p>

Madison's biographers generally agree little is known about the private life, including food likes/dislikes, of James Madison. Dolley Madison's lavish dinners and entertainments represented the finest mix of Virginian fare and French cuisine. Presumably, Mr. Madison enjoyed some of these foods. The French connection was Jefferson's legacy. By the time the Madisons took residence in the White House, these types of meals/dishes were expected to be served. 
Biographers note Mr. Madison's early love of agriculture growing up in Virginia remained with him throughout his life. Some of his contemporaries (see below) 
reference bounteous harvest-style dinners. It is quite possible Mr. Madison's favorite meal consisted of Virginia ham, buttery rolls, apple pie and cider.
<p>
"In considering the social side of James Madison's administration, it become immediately apparent that the dominant figure was Mrs. Madison. No President's wife
 before her was so thoroughly in charge of the nation's social life...On the surface, the social scene during Madison's administration followd the pattern established
 by Jefferson. The cuisine was French as well asn English--Virginian; the wines were the finest French vintages; the hospitality was as open and cordial as
 Jefferson's. But Dolley was an innovator in her own right, with a style of her own. She did not share Jefferson's preference for intimate gatherings above all else, but
 enjoyed having masses of people about--for dinner, lawn parties, luncheons, teas, and dances...Dolley's idea of entertainment was in effect "the more the 
merrier."...Like Jefferson politically, the Madison shared his aversion to formality and pompousness....The servant problems that nagged at the preceding
 Presidencies did not seem to affect Dolley Madison. Fore one thing, she supervised her own kitchen...When the President and his wife had a dinner party, 
provisions were lavish. Mrs. Seaton, wife of the owner of the National Intelligence (news publication), commented on one occasion: 'The dinner was certainly very
 fine, but still I was rather surprised, as it did not surpass some I have eaten in Carolina. There were many French dishes and exquisite wines...Ice creams, 
macaroons, preserves and various cakes are placed on the table, which are removed for almonds, raisins, pecan-nuts, apples, pears, etc...'...Dolley, following the 
customary form of her day, was expected to do the serving and even the carving...After dinner and a second dessert of fruit and nuts, there were parlor games, 
songs, music and even dancing...It was Dolley Madison who introduced the Easter Egg Rolling on the White House lawn, which was to become a tradition with
 almost all succeeding Presidents' families...The Madison present a paradox. Considering the length of time they were on the national scene, there is little known 
about their private persons...James Madison, small and slender, was undoubtedly a sparing eater. But what foods pleased him most? Dolley...undoubtedly liked 
food. But of her special favorite dishes little is known. Some few choice recipes and preferences were recorded, but they were relatively few, considering the 
frequency of her entertaining."<br>

"The most famous hostess in the White House has ever had came from the unlikely background of a devout Quaker family.  The orderly, quiet routine of her 
childhood in Virginia and her girlhood in Philadelphia had given her no training in the art of hospitality. Indeed at the time she married James Madison in 1794, as the
 yound widow of Todd, with one child, her life and personality seemed already set into the traditional Quaker molds. But the...warmhearted Dolley inside the 
Quaker mold adapted quickly to her new life and loved every minute of it...Dolley soon adapted herself to the worldly customs of the new life she was leading...
Before long, she was the recognized leader of Washington society...At dinner parties, Mrs. Madison also gracefully took the reins. She presided at the head of the
 table with her guests on her right and left, Madison at the side and his secretary at the foot of the table. This saved him from the effort of serving the guests, drinking
 wine, and leading the conversation...After their retirement the hospitality of Montpellier was Dolley's chief occupation...Dinner at Montpellier was an elaborate 
affair. The food on the table was always luxurious. Food for a party would incude three or four kinds of meat, three or four kinds of bread, fresh vegetables, fruit, 
pastry, champagne and ice."<br>

served." "Small-beer and cyder" were the usual table drinks, though milk was provided at supper. Variety and wholesome nourishment were promised, by 
proscptive students were warned not to expect "luxurious danties, or costly delicacies," and private meals were not permitted in student chambers. Some "young 
gentlemen," however, were allowed "to make a dish of tea in their apartments, provided it be done after evening prayer [and does] not interfere with hours of 
study.""<br>

"The Madisons spent three winter seasons in Philadelphia...'They breakfasted at nine o'clock on ham or salt fish, herring,....coffee or tea, and slices of toast or

 potatoes. Following that are boiled green peas...then baked or fried eggs, boiled or fried fish, salad [of] thinly sliced cabbage...pastries, sweets to which they are 
excessively partial and which are insuffiently cooked...The entire meal is washed down with cider, weak or strong beer, then white wine...They keep drinking
 [Bordeaux or Madiera] right through dessert, towad the end of which any ladies who are at the dinner leave the table and withdraw by themselves, leaving the men
 free to drink as much as they please...In the evening, round seven or eight o'clock (on such ordinary days as have not been set aside for formal dinners), tea is 
served,...but without meat. The whole family is united at tea, to whcih friends, acquaintences and even strangers are invited.""<br>

"...the Madisons had, for a large company, 'An excellent dinner. The round of Beef of which the Soup is made is called Bouilli: It had in the dish spices and 
something of the sweet herb and Garlic kind, and a rich gravy. It is very much boiled,  and it still very good. We had a dish with waht appeared to be Cabbage
 much boiled, then cut in long strings and somewhat mashed [water or land cress]; in the middle a large Ham, with the Cabbage around. It looked like our country
 [New England] dishes of Bacon and Cabbage, with the Cabbage mashed up, after being boiled till sodden and turned dar. The Dessert gook; much as usual, 
except two dishes which appeared like Apple pie, in the form of the half of a musk-melon, the flat side down, tops creased deep, and the color a dark brown" 
Though Foster, used to European formality, criticized the Madison table for being "more like a harvest-home supper, than the entertainment of a Secretary of 
State," Dolley Madison made no apology."<br>

<p>
<b>Retirement</b><br>
"Madison's daily routine began as he was dressed and attended to by his personal valet...After breakfast at eight or nine, Madison relaxed for a time on the portico 
with his guests...At two in the afternoon, before dinner, the Madisons visited the rooms of Nelly Madison [Mr. Madison's mother], who usually took her meals 
separately...After this filial call, the Madisons dined with theircompany about four o'clock, in a meal that usually lasted two hours...The ned to make a living, as well 
as Madison's agrarian convicitons about the good life, requried him to remain an active farmer..."<br>

<b>What was served for dinner when the White House was burning (August 24, 1814)?</b><br> 
Nothing. Scholars examine primary documents from different angles with specific agendas. Some come close; others take liberties. The War of 1812 was
 complicated. We examined primary, secondary, and presidential culinary history sources for this particular question. While they generally cite the same primary
sources, they return conflicting accounts; some of
 which do not make sense.

<b>Standard stories</b><br> 
"President's House, 11 P.M., Wednesday, August 24. [Robert] Ross need not have placed the order for food. Moving on to the President's House, the British walked unmolested through the front door and found the mansion deserted, but ready to host visitors. The table in the state dining room was set for dinner for forty. Plate holders by the fireplace were filled with dishes; knives, forks, and spoons were laid out; and fine wine poured into cut-glass decanters was chilling on ice on the sideboard. Unfamiliar with Dolley Madison's hospitality, the British assumed the Americans had prepared a victory banquet. The sight tickled Ross's Irish fancy. 'So unexpected was our entry and capture of Washington, and so confident was Madison (President of the States) of the defeat of our troops, that he had prepared for supper for the expected conquerors; and when our advance party entered the president's house they found a table laid with 40 covers.' he delightedly wrote his brother-in-law, Ned Glascock. 'The fare, however, which was intended for Jonathan was voraciously devoured by John Bull, and the health of the Prince Regent, and success to His majesty's arms by sea and land, was drunk in the best wines, Madison having taken to his heels and ensured his safety on the opposite bank of the river...' Exuberant toasts were offered: 'Peace with America--war with Madison, ' proposed Ross. 'Nor was Mr. Madison's health forgotten, in his own best claret, for being so good a fellow as to leave us such capital supper,' recalled Major Norman Pringle, commander of the 21st Regiment Genadier Company. Lieutenant Scott, exhausted and feverish with heat and thirst, picked up a crystal goblet of madeira and gulped it down. He pronounced it 'super-excellent,' The men, including a company of hungry Fusiliers, wolfed down the food."

In the kitchen, 'spits, loaded with joints of various sorts stood before the fire; pits, saucepans, and other culinary utensils stood on the grate with all other requisites for and elegant and substantial repast. The invaders helped themselves gratefully. Having enjoyed this fortuitous hospitality, and toasted the king in presidential wine, they systematically ransacked the other rooms, robbed the cellars of their bottles, then prepared to burn the place down."

<b>The myth</b><br>
"In 1814, when the British were advancing on and burning the Capitol City, she was among the last to leave. Finally, at the frantic urging of servants, she came down from from the roof 
of the White House, her spyglass in hand, gathered together valuable state papers, ordered the Stuart portrait of Washington taken from the wall, wrote a letter to her sister, and, dressed as 
a farmer's wife, left the city in a wagon and spent the night in an army tent." <br>
---<i>The White House Cookbook</i>, edited by Janet Halliday Ervin [Follett Publishing Company:Chicago IL] 1964 (p. 323) <br>
[NOTE: Dolley Madison did have a spyglass but she was across the river at a friend's house, not on the White House roof.]

<b>Revisiting the story: a study of primary sources.</b><br>
"The legendary Madison entertaining gave rise to the story that even when the British were descending on Washington, about to set it afire during the War of 1812, Dolley was in the midst of plans for a dinner party. An English writer, Gleig, said that the British troops arrive at the Executive Mansion and 'found a bountiful dinner spread for forty guests. This they concludes was for the American officers who were expected to return victorious from the field at Bladenburg.' One assumes that if the report is true, the British consumed the meal before plundering and burning the White House. While this is an intriguing story, there is nothing on record that substantiates it. The White House was burned August 24, 1814, and Dolley's letter of August 23 to her sister indicates that she had dozens of things on their mind--but not a dinner party. What perhaps gave currency to the feasting-while-the-capital-burns story was a book published in 1865 called A Colored Man's Reminiscences of James Madison. The author was Paul Jenings, a slave of Madison's, and in the book he corroborated Gleig's report of the dinner. Jenings was there at the time and wrote: 'I set the table myself.' Still, he wrote many years after the incident had supposedly occurred, and memory in an old man plays tricks."

<p>
"To the delight and surprise of the hungry British soldiers, the dining table was loaded with viands choice enough to spread before a gourmet like the Prince Regent. It was laid out for a banquet of forty persons--a sizable dinner company even for entertainers like the Madisons. For the British home public the most amusing feature of the invasion was that the American President had ordered an elaborate dinner which he through to enjoy a at leisure with his friends and Army officers in celebration of the deliverance of the capital city. No doubt it was the merriment of the British which caused the banquet story to be denied so emphatically by American sources, including some of the members of Madison's staff, who refused to concede that the President's meal, prepared for cabinet members, dignitaries and generals, was eaten by privates of the wrong army. The first reference to the banquet was contained in a letter from a British midshipman published in a London newspaper. The historian of the 44th Regiment relates the story. Gleig adhered to it sixty-odd years later, after the various reasons why it was challenged were submitted to him . His description ran: 'Several kinds of wine, in handsome glass decanters, were cooling on the sideboard. Plate holders stood by the fireplace, filled with dishes and plates; knives, forks and spoons were arranged for immediate use; in short, everything was ready for the entertainment of a ceremonious party. In the kitchen spits loaded with joints of various sorts, turned before the fire. Pots, saucepans and other culinary utensils stood upon the grate, and all the other requisites for an elegant and substantial repast, were exactly in a state which indicated that they had been lately and precipitately abandoned. Jean P. Sioussa, a refugee of the French Revolution known around the President's house as 'French John,' formerly a retainer of the British minister, Anthony Merry, served as Madison's doorkeeper at the time of the invasion. He repudiated the entire banquet story. Nothing was in the kitchen when the British came, he asserted, except a little meat. One wonders that the matter has been considered of sufficient importance for all the inquires and denials, but controversies lead to re-examinants and conclusions. The British did, in fact, find a banquet awaiting for them. One of the enlightening accounts of what occurred at the President's house before the coming of the British has been supplied by Madison's body slave, Paul Jennings. In his pamphlet, A Colored man's Reminiscences of James Madison, Jennings tells how he had set the table on the afternoon of August 24 and had 'brought up the ale, cider, and wine, and placed them in coolers, as all the cabinet and several military gentlemen and strangers were expected.' Mrs. Madison had informed him that dinner would be ready at the regular hour of three, when the President, who ordinarily ate no supper, dined. The slave's account leaves no doubt that a large meal was in prospect, and that it was ordered by either the President or his wife. The question of who ordered it might have been answered had Admiral Cockburn preserved the trinkets and souvenirs he took from the executive palace. They included penciled notes Madison had written to Mrs. Madison from Bladensburg battlefield."

"Well, on the 24th of August, sure enough, the British reached Bladensburg, and the fight began between 11 and 12. Even that very morning General Armstrong 
assured Mrs. Madison there was no danger. The President, with General Armstrong, General Winder, Colonel Monroe, Richard Rush, Mr. Graham, Tench 
Ringgold, and Mr. Duvall, rode out on horseback to Bladensburg to see how things looked. Mrs. Madison ordered dinner to be ready at 3, as usual ; I set the table
 myself, and brought up the ale, cider, and wine, and placed them in the coolers, as all the Cabinet and several military gentlemen and strangers were expected."<br>

<p>
<b>What is the "real" truth? </b><br>
Hard to say. In this case, primary documents/eyewitness accounts support different national agendas. Scholars generally agree that neither James or Dolley Madison were on White House (President's house) grounds the night of the fire. If a table was set for dinner (@3, the normal time for formal main meal of the day), it makes no sense it would be sizzling in the kitchen ready-to-go when the British torchers arrived at 11PM. Especially when the President & his wife were not at home. The story of finding the table set for 40 covers may be plausible because it might have been standard protocol at that time. The idea of ransacking arsonists sitting down to a nicely prepared feast before completing their assignment is a stretch. On the other hand, if food was out, hungry soldiers would have done a grab & go. The story of British soldiers consuming Madison's bar is very believable.

<b>Did Dolley Madison start the Easter Egg Roll tradition?</b><p>
Maybe. Maybe not. Popular American history generally credits Dolley Madison for initiating the Easter Egg roll/hunt in Washington 
D.C. Hillary Clinton's official statements (below) perpetuate the myth. Serious White House historians and several academic experts respectfully question the validity of this claim based
on lack of primary evidence. 

<p>
"One delightful piece of Dolleyania has defied accurate documentation to the day: the belief that it was Dolley who inaugurated the tradition of the annual White 
House Easter egg roll on Easter Monday. Neither Dolly nor any of her contemproaries mentions this event in any document located to date, but true or not, the
 tradition is now firmly attached to Dolley's White House years. Ethel Stephens Arnett, one of Dolley's more recent biographers, wrote that young John Payne Todd 
had heard that an egg hunt or roll had been practiced by the Egyptians and suggested that his mother adopt the game for him and his friends. "Dolley liked the
 idea," Arnett wrote, "and with her own hand tinted hundreds of hard-boiled eggs in bright colors, invited the children of the earea to come and play with them, and 
thus started the Easter Egg Hunt on the White House lawn. She is said by some to have started the tradition on the grounds of the Capitol. In the original version of
 the egg roll, children brought baskets of colored hard-boiled eggs and sat in long rows...White House historian, William Seale, researched the tradition and wrote 
that President Rutherford B. Hayes "had begun the tradition of rolling Easter Eggs on the White House lawn. This Easter Monday custom had originated at the 
Capitol many years before; now one remembering exactly when."<br>

<p>

"MRS. CLINTON: Well, I'm so glad to see all of you here. And this year we've done a few things a little differently to try to make it even better for all of you. You
 know, the very first Easter Egg Roll took place in 1809. Now, how many of you were here for that one? (Laughter.) Good. That was Dolly Madison who started it
 in 1809, and it used to be at the Capitol. And then it was moved here to the White House. And every year the Monday after 
Easter is when we do this."<br>

James Monroe, like Thomas Jefferson, acquired a taste for French cuisine while serving abroad. His White House dinners 
reflected contemporary standards of elegant European tradition. Mr. Monroe is said to have loved this food. He also enjoyed
dishes from his native Virginia.

"On the Monroe family plantation in Virginia...[Elizabeth Monroe]
served many old Southern recipes, dishes her husband hand known from boyhood. One of the most famous, spoon bread, dates back to early
Indian days...James Monroe, like his former teacher and mentor, Thomas Jefferson, was fond of Continental cuisines, but he was
equally fond of the foods of his Virginia childhood...Chicken Fried with Rice...[was] used frequently by Elizabeth Monroe at the

His culinary education had certainly been extensive...Yet throughout the Adamas diary rood references are sparse. Adams never 
failed to mention with whom he dined and how overn, but the contents of the meals obviously concerned him so little they were not 
worthy of comment...Adams was especially fond of fruit. The White House orchards flourished and eventually the apricot, plum, apple,

"Folks driving in downtown Jackson will be in for a surprise as characters dressed in 1800s costumes stroll along the street near The Carnegie Center for Arts and History and The Aeneas Building on Oct. 30. Then General Andrew Jackson and his wife Rachel will arrive in a carriage.
It's The Three Stars Collation & Frolicking Preview Party at The Aeneas Building that will begin at 7:30 p.m. and will recreate the historic evening of Sept. 18, 1825, when Jackson and his wife were wined and dined by the city's residents.
Jon Meacham, editor of Newsweek magazine, is honorary chairman. Chairwomen for the event are Roberta Price, Patty Lewis and May Scott.
The evening's menu will include some of Jackson's favorites: Spiced round of tenderloin with mini biscuits and jezebel sauce; hot water corn cakes with caramelized onions & squash relish, roasted lamb chops with rosemary, hoppin' John, cheese and grapes, benne wafers, floating islands and mini-custard tarts.
...The exhibit curator is Dr. Larry Ray, an art historian specializing in the history of interiors and decorative arts. The collection comes from across Tennessee, including the Tennessee State Museum.
...But he also was a man who had a French chef and enjoyed French wines. He was as familiar with the fine art of cooking as he was with the fine art of hunting men in war.
Gala co-chair Patty Lewis said the event will include fall decorations, "quilt tops, pumpkins of all varieties, mums and bittersweet. There will be four tablescapes. When you enter the Aeneas Building, you'll see an alcove on the back wall where a portrait of Andrew Jackson by Jordan Stonecipher will be unveiled and presented to the city. The exhibit at The Carnegie will be fabulous, and it's catalogued in a book created by Dr. Ray."
The event will be a cocktail dinner and buffet with heavy hors d'oeuvres, "enough to be dinner," said Gena Mandle, caterer, who is preparing the meal. "We're recreating a lot of Jackson's favorites. We brainstormed about what would work and what wouldn't."
"We also wanted a menu with items that fit together," said Lewis, "and feasible to serve to 250 people." She added that there will be an open bar and wine and beer for guests.
Mandle said the floating islands will be lemon raspberry and chocolate mousse with creme anglais. She'll also offer Old Hickory Nut Soup in shot glasses for a taste and mini-trifles of gingerbread, pear and custard.
Terry Ford of Lauderdale County, a long-time food historian, researched the menu. Ford has one of the nation's largest collections of cookbooks, some dating from the Middle Ages.
..."I have quite a large library, and I have presidents' cookbooks on a shelf. There are a lot of menus and recipes of the presidents. Andrew Jackson - a quite colorful fellow - liked a variety of things.
He kept a horseshoe-shaped table in the state dining room. He had the finest china, silver and furniture for the East Room. People called him King Andrew because of the magnificence of his culinary banquets," Ford said.
He liked leg of lamb and lamb chops, particularly with rosemary. The Hermitage had a lot of rabbits, and he was fond of that. He had a French chef. He was not so 'backwoodsy.' There were a lot of things at the White House, oysters on the half shell, blue points, primarily - and they had French wines.
Rachel Jackson died of a heart attack Dec. 22 before Jackson's inauguration was held in January, so White House entertaining was handled by Emily Donelson, who became his hostess.
Other foods Jackson enjoyed were "Leather Britches," which was green beans cooked with water and bacon, braised wild duck and wild goose and fried apple pies for snacks.
"And he liked fried ham and ham gravy, oh yes," said Ford. "He had an Old Hickory nut soup - that was hickory nuts, hot water and sugar, pound it with a mortar and pestle and make a paste, add water to it, strain it, of course."
The floating islands involved whipping up a meringue and having boiled custard underneath.
"Sometimes you add sherry and almond flavoring to it and sometimes cake," he said.
He liked to serve his White House guests Daniel Webster's punch, which included lemon, sugar, green tea, brandy, claret, champagne, bananas, orange pineapples, cherries and strawberries.
"Anyone who drank this, one cup would do it," Ford chuckled.
Ford said the preview party "is going to be very elaborate and will be quite an event in many ways - and it will be fun."

"...Harrison's Presidency lasted a single month, too short a time to provide a real clue as who what might have been, culinarily
speaking...One thing is certain...he did enjoy food and took pleasure in selecting tidbits for his family table. One of his frist
expressed wishes regarding the social side of his Presidency was to do his own marketing for the White House table. And market
he did...The custom of plying potential voters with food and drink was practiced by politicians from Washington's day onwards. But it 
reached its zenith...in the campaign of 1840, when Harrison lieutenants wined and dined the populace throughout the West....all 
eligible makes were [treated] to a feast of cornbread, cheese, and hard cider. Little by little the feasts became more 
elaborate...Burgoo [squirrel & vegetable stew]...was the perfect election dish, as it was easily expandable to the size of the crowd...During Harrion's campaign for
the Presidency, the hard [alcoholic] cider flowed so freely...that Harrison became known as the Hard Cider Candidate."<br>

"A letter...refers to Harrison's old gardener, who had been asked to come and live in Vincennes. The importance of the gardener
evidently arose from Mr. Harrison's love of fresh vegetables. When he went to Bogota in the 1830's as United States Minister, he 
wrote home: 'I have a very excellent garden, beans, peas, cabbages, cauliflower, celery and artichokes in abundance, and we shall soon

"The Tyler Presidency is an illustration of the feminine influence on a social system. Socially speaking, there were two Tyler administrations.
 The first began with the death of William Henry Harrison...At [Tyler's] side was his wife, Letitia...Both Tylers were
unceremonious, hospitable Virginians...The following year Letitia Tyler died. But the informal note struck at the
beginning of Tyler's term of office remained...John Tyler lived in Washington as he had in Virginia. He even brought to the
White House the same slaves who had cared for his family in Williamsburg...For two years Tyler lived simply and comforatably at
the Whtie House. His daughter, Letitia Semple, one of his seven children described their life in the Presidential house:
"We breakfasted at eight-thirty and dined at three o'clock, except on state occasions...and had tea served after our daily cares
and duties, because my father's time was rarely his own..."...There were many parties given during the holiday season for Washington officialdom. Always the tables were
laden with substantial and varied foods...No one foresaw, in that winter of 1843, that the newly arrived beauty on the Washington
social scene, Julia Gardiner, would within a short time be the arbiter of the city's taste and style...As soon as the word was out,
the newspapers began feeding elaborate detail of the wedding feast to avid readers...The wedding supper was described in deatil:
"Cold woodcock, pigeons, chicken salad, oysters prepared in various ways, but no wines, this being strictly forbidden by the
bridegroom and assented to by the bride...Breakfast appears to have been even mroe elaborate. Omelets, spring chicken, pigeons
and woodcock, ham and eggs, salmon, beefsteaks, kidneys boiled eggs, and young duck......With only eight months
left of Tyler's term of office, Julia decided to make the most of it. Accustomed to the flourishes of high society in Europe, she set
about duplicating some the the pageantry she had witnessed there...... Roast ham, a saddle of venison or some other heavy roast, roast wild
ducks, or other poultry all were in evidence. Enormous supplies of home-baked cakes and pudding were on
hand. Puddings were a great Tyler favorite. Punch, Madeira [a type of wine], and the ubiquitous champagne
were ready."<br>

indicative of his zest for fine food, his appreciation for gourmet repast, his adventurous eating habits. Alas...He had little

prepared in a simple, farm style, as part of the pattern...Meat, potatoes, and vegetables were the ingredients of life for the
Fillmores...Corn Pudding...has been a favorite dish of simple eaters such as the Fillmores as well as of White House gourmets
...To...Millard Fillmore, it was natural that a good hearty soup would often serve as a full meal...Soup to a New York farm
family such as Fillmore's was more of a stew of meat, potatoes, and vegetables; when ready to serve, the solids were removed from

President Buchanan loved to entertain in grand European style. Like Thomas Jefferson, he was fond of French cuisine. He also delighted in Pennsylvania Dutch
 (German) fare. Below please find historic notes and selected recipes:
<p>
"With the election of President James Buchanan, our only unmarried president, the Capital began the gayest social season in its history. The man in the White House
 was wealthy, an epicurean, a...bachelor with a flair for society and impeccable knowledge of its ways. The First lady was to be his niece, Miss Harriet Lane, a
 lovely young lady of twenty-five who had been well prepared and trained for her exciting new role...The White House receptions again became gorgeous displays 
of finery...Buchanan was so particular about the quality of his food that he had fresh butter sent him regularly from Philadelphia in a locked brass-bound kettle."<br>
---<i>The First Ladies Cook Book: Favorite Recipes of All the Presidents of the United States</i>, Margaret Brown Klapthor [Parents Magazine Enterprises:New
 York]1982 revised edition (p. 104-105)<br> [NOTE: Recipes included in this book: Pennsylvania Dutch Stuffed Shoulder of Pork, Mashed Potatoes, 
Gooseberry Tart, & Cinnamon Apples.]
<p>
"For a brief moment before the storm of war--the four years before the Civil War--gaiety returned in full force to the White House, after four administrations of 
deprivation...Buchanan...had had wide exposure to European manners and had developed a certain partiality for French cuisine. He liked the formal elegance of 
European socitey...The President did not stint on entertaining. For elaborate dinners and receptions he called on the services of Gautier, a French caterer. Gautier
 had a reputation for the beauty and finesse of his service and preparations as well as the superb quality of his cooking. Gourmets exclaimed over the partridge, 
terrapin, oysters, lobster, and wild turkey served under his supervision...Frequently, Buchanan was forced to pay the bills for his lavish dinners and receptions out of
 his own pocket. In spite his innate formality, he did not mind this, for he enjoyed entertaining and wanted to do it well. The biggest social event of Buchanan's four 
years was surely the visit of England's Prince of Wales to Washington...This was the first visit to the former American colonies of an heir-apparent to the British 
throne...Two lavish dinner parties were held for the Crown Prince...[at Buchanan's inaugural ball, March 4, 1857]...The five thousand revelers were served eight
 rounds of beef, seventy-five hams, sixty saddles of mutton, four saddles of venison, four hundred gallons of oysters, five quarts of jellies, twelve hundred quarts of
 ice cream in assorted flavors, and pates of infinate variety. Three thousand dollars had been spent on the wines. And the high point of the evening was a pyramid of 
a cake, four feet high and cleverly ornamented with a flag bearing the insignia of every state in the Union...Olympian as this all was, it was still but a hint of the 
gargantuan banquets of the administration to come. One might think that such quantiites of food would be enough for several armies, but the food actually ran out
 before the guests had completely given up...Those critics who may have objected to Buchanan's adherence to a formal etiquette had no complaint about the bounty
 of his service. His dinners were generally "pronounced superb in manner and style." The presidential routine was simpler than his entertaining patterns. He normally
 rose early, and had an early breakfast, read the newspaper and was buisily at work at his desk by eight o'clock. At five in the afternoon, a brisk your's walk gave 
him a good appetite for the elaborate dinner that usually followed. Dinner was almost always at the White House...One day a week, some of the cabinet members
 and their wives were invited to have dinner at the White House en famille [together as a family]....Although not of German stock, President Buchanan enjoyed the 
specialties prepared by the Pennsylvania Dutch inhabitants of his native state."<br>

"During several years of collecting material for <i>The Presidents'Cookbook</i>...we 
ran into all sorts of controversey concerning President Lincoln's habits, his likes and dislikes, when it came to food. Judging from menus of the 
state balls and banquets given at the White House during Lincoln's Administration--some of the most elaborate in our history--one
might conclude that Honest Abe was a gourmet to end all gourmets. Nothing, of course, could be further from the truth. Giving the 
opposite side of the picture, certain observers of the times...said flatly that Lincoln was almost entierely indifferent to 
food, 'Except that he liked apples and hot coffee.' The President's bodyguard wrote, however, 'Mr. Lincoln was a hearty eater. Her
never lost his tates for things that a growing farmer's boy would like. He was particularly fond of bacon.' Probably like most of our
strongest Presidents (excepting Jefferson), Lincoln relied on food to feed the furnace. Undoubtedly he ate well when 
served a tasty meal but was usually so preoccupied that he gave little thought to food. One thing seems certain: hew was a gentle
man at the table and uncritical. His stepmother said, 'He ate what was before him, making no complaint.' A companion of his 
lawyer days, Leonard Sweet, wrote, 'I never in the 10 years of circuit life I knew him heard him complain of a hard bed or a bad meal of 
victuals."<br>
---"Fast Gourmet: Honest Abe's favorite Food," Poppy Cannon, <i>Chicago Daily Defender</i>, February 8, 1968 (p. 22)
<p>
"Just as so much about [Abraham Lincoln's] life has been shrouded in latter-day myth and legend,
making it difficult to assess the truth about the man, so, too, have his food habits and tastes been
the subject of controversy...It seems to us that the food truth about Lincoln must lie somewhere between these extreme points
of view...One aspect of Abraham
Lincoln's characteristically gentle nature was apparent in his approach to food...
Temprementally...Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln were totally unlike...This was striking apparent when it
came to food and food history. Although both came originally from Kentucky, they reflected two
completely different Kentucky traditions. Mary had been raised in the lush bluegrass region of the
state, where gracious, comfortable living and rich, elaborate cooking were legendary. Abe gew up
on the frontier, where he ate very plain food, partly for economic reasons, partly because of the
frontier tradition. Corn dodgers, cakes made of coarse cornmeal, were a staple. Wild game provided
the protein a growing boy needed. During the days of young manhood, where he boarded at the
Rutledge Tavern in New Salem, his diet consisted largely of cornbread, mush, bacon, eggs, and milk.
Several friends of that period recalled later that if Abe was partial to any one food it was honey, a
great delicacy for him at the time."<br>

<p>
"Family meals at the Lincolns' were routine. Early in the morning the President liked a "good hot cup of coffee." But often he would
forget about breakfast until 9 or 10A.M. John Hay, one of Lincoln's privage secretaries, occasionally ate with the President. He
noted that the frugal repast might consist of "an egg, a piece of toast, coffee, etc." On occasion breakfast was a single egg.
For lunch, Hay reported, Lincoln "took a little lunch--a biscuit, a glass of milk in winter, some fruit or grapes in summer...He ate
less than anyone I know." Lunch was usually eaten irregularly..."<br>

"Abraham Lincoln dined in a spartan fashion...He would rather nibble fruit. His wife Mary tried everything to make Abe eat but has
frustrated time and time again to see the finest foods left all but untouched on his plate. One of the few entrees that would
tempt Lincoln was Chicken Fricassee. He liked the chicken cut up in small pieces, fried with seasonings of nutmeg and mace and served with 
a gravy made of the chicken drippings. Mary Lincoln set a table at the White House, which included such food as Aspic of Tongue, 
Pate de Foie Gras, Turkey stuffed with Truffles, and all sorts of wild game, such as venison, pheasant, or canvasback duck. But
all too often the President merely picked at his food."

<b>The gingerbread story, retold by Carl Sandburg:</b><br>
"The 'gingerbread story,' which [Lincoln] had mentioned without telling, in one of the debates with Douglas, touched yound and old.
...'When we lived in Indiana,' he said, 'once in a while my mother used to get some sorghum and ginger and make some gingerbread.
It wasn't often, and it was our biggest treat. One day I smelled the gingerbread and came into the house to get my share while
it was still hot. My mother had baked me three gingerbread men. I took them out under a hickory tree to eat them. There was
a family near us poorer than we were, and their boy came along as I sat down. 'Abe,' he said, 'gimme a man?' I gave him one.
He crammed it into his mouth in two bites and looked at me while I was biting the legs off my first one. 'Abe,' he said, 'timme the onter'n.'
I said to him, 'You seem to like gingerbread.' 'Abe,' he sais, 'I don't s'pose anybody on earth likes gingerbread better'n I do--and gets
less'n I do.'"<br>

<b>What kind of cook was Mary Todd Lincoln?</b><br>
Mary Todd Lincoln was born to a wealthy family in Lexington Kentucky. As such, she was well schooled in the fine aspects of social etiquette rather than the 
practical arts of domestic life. Her biographers note Mary's early frugality and preference for simplicity. Her entertainments were well attended and, as one might 
expect, grew lavish in the White House period. She was especially fond of strawberries, and enjoyed giving strawberry sociables, where these fine fruits were 
combined with cake and ice cream.
<p>
"By the 1840s improved methods of salting and icing allowed Mary Lincoln to keep food longer than her mother could. Imported oysters, a delicacy on local
 menus, could be preserved for weeks by bountiful washing in salted water and some help from the weather. A few heretics (Mary Lincoln was not usually one of 
them) no longer baked bread, depending, instead, on a wagon that delivered bread, crackers, and cakes three times a week. The Springfiled stores were beginning
 to sell prepared butter, and in season local farmers brought vegetables and fruits down Jackson Street for the unfixed prices that proper ladies were not supposed 
to contest. Penny-pinching Mary Lincoln was among those who violated the prescription that ladies don't beat down prices, and she had several public battles with
 the fruit peddler over the prices of his less than perfect strawberries...Lincoln was never a fussy eater, and was satisfied most mornings with an apple for his 
breakfast. Still, he would be home for dinner in the middle of the day, and only delinquent housekeepers kept men waiting. But in Mary Lincoln's home it was the 
husband whose casual sense of time and lack of appetite made regular hours an impossibility...Sometimes Abraham helped out by shopping...Even with improved
 technology and help with marketing, cooking took up the largest part of Mary Lincoln's day. Some Springfield women relished their culinary labors and earned
 awards at the country fair for their pickles, preserves, cakes and pies...Mary never entered those competitions, or at least she never won a prize. The one
 household product for which she was remembered--what the family circulated as Mary's recipe for white cake--was a simplified gloss on the more complicated 
version of a standard cake...Having grown up without practical experience in cooking, Mary relied on Kentucky staples. Years later, amid the haute cuisine of
 France, she fondly remembered the "waffles, batter cakes, and egg cornbread--not to mention "buckwheat cakes" of Lexington. The Lincoln menu was also full 
of what Mrs. Trollope disparaged as America's "sempiternal ham," and Mary Lincoln's frugality encouraged the appearance of cheap local game, such as
 woodchucks, pheasants, and prairie chickens. In any case, she learned to do what the slaves had done in Lexington: roast coffee, make calf's-foot jelly, 
preserve fruit, and prepare cheese. In the summer the kitchen ran her, and it was both the repetitiveness and the lack of control that led disaffected matrons to
 compare themselves to slaves...By 1851, after nearly ten years of housekeeping, Mary Lincoln had progressed to an advanced version of Miss Leslie's Cookery, 
purchasing this, along with Miss Leslie's House Book or Manual of Domestic Economy for Town and Country...In the more difficutlt version there were recipes for 
everything from family soup to to invalid cookery of beef tea and blackberry preserve...Because she had not learned the vices of sugar and, like everyone in 
Springfield, innocently belived it the "most nourishing substance in nature," she spent hours making puddings, cakes, candies, and cookies. By modern standards, 
the Lincoln household consumed a vast amount of sugar...Some of these sweets were eaten by others, for if Mary Lincoln was a novice cook, she was a practiced
 hostess with an easy charm that obscured any shortcomings in her menus. Her contemporary Julia Jayne Trumbull acknowledged her as the "prettiest talker in 
Springfield,"..."Mary Lincoln often entertained small numbers of friends at dinner and somewhat larger numbers at evening parties. Her table was famed for the 
excellence of its rare Kentucky dishes and in season was loaded with venison, wild turkeys, prairie chickens and quail and other game" ...In her kitchen at Eighth 
and Jackson Mary Lincoln relied on simple fare, offering her guests not four courses but tea and cakes and strawberries in season. "This last week, we gave a 
strawberry company of about seventy," she wrote in 1859.  "If your health will admit of venturing out, in such damp weather," went one Mary Lincoln invitation,
 "we would be much pleased to have you, Mr. B., and the young ladies came round, this eve about seven and pass a social evening." By seven Mason and Mary 
Brayman would have eaten their middle-of-the-day dinner as well as their supper, leaving the hostess responsible only for dessert. Unlike some of her friends and 
family, Mary Lincoln did not use her cooking for charitable purposes...though she often invited friends from the...church for tea and cakes...By the mid-1850s 
Lincoln's prominence required substantial entertainments, and with money available from his successful law practice, Mary Lincoln hosted large receptions--what in
 the East passed a levees. On the prairies, as elsewhere, French was the language of sociability, used by Mary and her friends to distinguish their grandest affairs
 from the even more elegant soirees or "grand fetes,"..Instead, she simply put food on the table, and the crowds poured into the house to eat it..."<br>

purport to be Mary's own. This one...can actually be traced down through the Todd family to Mary Hosford, a granddaughter of one
of Mary's cousins, who included it in her <i>Missouri Traveler Cookbook</i>. [FT Editor Note: This recipe appears on in

<br>
Sugar<br>
Caramelized sugar syrup<br>
Egg whites<br>
Butter<br>
Baking powder<br>
Cake flour<br>
Salt<br>
Vanilla<br>
One begins by 'burning' the sugar. Melt 1/2 cup sugar in a heavy iron skillet. Heat slowly, stirring continuously with a wooden 
spoon, until the sugar becomes a very dark brown. Then add 1/2 cup hot water and stir until sugar dissolves. This is the caramelized
sugar you will use in the cake. Now beat 3 egg whites until very stiff, adding to them a little ast a time 1/2 cup white sugar. 
Set aside. In another bowl, cream 1/2 cup butter with 1/2 cup white sugar. Add 2 teaspoons baking powder to 1 1/2 cups cake
flour, along with a dash of salt. Sift together then add to the butter-sugar mixture, alternating with the caramelized sugar
syrup--first a little flour, then a little syrup, until all have been used. Fold in the stiffly beaten egg whites. Flavor with 1
teaspoon vanilla and bake in 2 greased and floured 8-inch cake pans. Bake about 45 minutes in a preheated moderate (350 degree F.)
oven.
<p>
<b>Frosting for Mary Todd's Courting Cake</b><br>
Melted butter<br>
Dark brown sugar<br>
Milk<br>
Powdered sugar<br>
Black walnuts (optional)<br>
Melt 1/2 cup butter in a heavy saucepan. Add 1 cup dark brown sugar and cook over low heat for 2 or 3 minutes, stirring constantly. 
Remove from the heat, add 1/3 cup milk and bring to a boil again. Cool to lukewarm and stir in gradually 2 cups powdered sugar. 
Beat vigorously until mixture is smooth. This makes enough frosting to cover the top and sides of an  8-inch layer cake. If you like,
even though it isn't strictly authentic, sprinkle black walnuts over the frosting. Delicious even if not Toddian.
<p>
<b>Mary Todd's Vanilla Almond Cake</b><br>
There are reports attributable to President Lincoln that this cake of his wife's was the best he ever ate...This delicious cake was the invention of 
Monsieur Giron, a Lexington [KY] caterer, who created it in honor of the visit to that city in 1825 of his fellow Frenchman, 
Lafayette. The Todd family acquired the recipe and cherished it ever after. The baking powder must have been added at a later date.<br>
Sugar<br>
Butter<br>
Flour<br>
Baking powder<br>
Milk<br>
Blanched almonds<br>
Egg whites<br>
Vanilla (or almond extract)<br>
Cream together 2 cups sugar with 1 cup butter. Sift 3 cups flour and 3 teaspoons baking powder three times and add to the butter-sugar
mixture alternately with 1 cup milk. Chop 1 cup blanched almonds until very fine and add them to the mixture. Beat vigorously, then
fold in 6 stiffly beaten egg whites carefully. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla, then fold in 6 stiffly beaten egg whites carefully. Add
1 teaspoon vanilla (almond extract if you prefer) and pour the mixture into a greased and floured angel-cake pan. Bake in a
a preheated moderate (350 degree F.) oven for approximately 1 hour, or until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the
cake's center. Turn the cake out on a wire rack and allow to cool before frosting it. This makes a very large cake. If you
prefer, you can bake it in 2 9-inch layer-cake pans. The cake may be made without the almonds and is a splendid plain white
cake, very light and good.
<p>
<b>Mary Todd's Candied Fruit Frosting</b><br>
Egg whites<br>
Sugar<br>
Water<br>
Vanilla (or almond extract)<br>
Salt<br>
Candied pineapple<br>
Crystallized cherries<br>
Beat 2 egg whites until very stiff. Set aside for a moment. Beat together 2 cups sugar and 1 cup water until the syrup spins
a thread about five inches long. Then slowly fold into the egg whites, a spoonful at a time, very slowly, beating well with an
electric beater as you add. Beat at top speed (very hard if you use a hand beater) until all the syrup is used and the mixture forms
peaks when dropped from a spoon. When stiff, slowly add 1 teaspoon vanilla or 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon almond
extract. Fold into the mixture 1/2 cup diced candied pineapple and 1/2 cup crystallized cherries cut in half. Spread between the layers
and over the top and sides of the vanilla almond cake. If desired, the candied fruit may be eliminated. The frosting is delicious
without them."<br>

<b>Abraham Lincoln's second inauguration supper: an eyewitness account</b><br>
Abraham Lincoln's second Inauguration was recounted in several magazines and newspapers by a variety of reporters. The <i>New York
Times</i> reporter was not named. Just noted as "Special Correspondence." We wonder who he (or she) was? Clearly, the meal was a
disaster. 
<p>
"The Supper.
It had been rumored--and the foundation for the report was only rumor--that the supper was to be something extraordinary. We were
suprised at this, because we knew good taste and modern custom, in small places like New-York, have, of late years, literally eschewed
the practice of immense suppers at public balls; and this reform had been reconcilated by the fact that such attempts had generally
ended in catastrophes to the toilets and tempers of all participants. It was, therefore, with misgivings that we saw it announced that a 
grand supper would be served in one of the corridors of the extensive building. The American people, in general, we are ashamed to say, have not yet learned
how to behave at table; and that species of etiquette, not too prevalent in private, is certainly always absent at public suppers. So it was
 not strange that we should have had warning visions of a grand rush, then a crush, and a demolition in the twinkling of an eye of all
th confectioner's handiwork, the frantic snatching of viands from the tables, the brandishing aloft of wine cup, and plate, and cutlery, 
laden with article alike dangerous to toilet and stomach; of munching and crunching sans ceremonie; of defilement and ruin to precious
apparel, the result perhaps of weeks of the dressmaker's effort; of the loss of temper, and loud cries of complaint. And indeed, we harbored
 a fear as a consequence that a graceful assemblage of dignified ladies and gentlemen might be transformed, as if by the wand of some
evil spirit, into a social raffle, where he who was rudest should be most successful in appeasing the cravings of the appetite, and in 
pocketing the delicate ornamentations of the table. 
<p>
"The name of the cuisiner has escaped us, and it is not worth while to hand it up now. 
Suffice it to say it was not Delmonico, therefore we did not expect perfection. The hall set apart for supper was the grand corridor in the west wing. The
table was set in the centre, and it gave standing-room for about three hundred persons one time. The cabinets of the works of genius and invention, placed
at intervals, served to form alcoves on each side of the supper-table. On one side, some of these were provided with seats; on the other, they were
reserved for depositing the extraordinary quantity of material necessary for such a host, and for the operations of the waiters. 
<p>
"The
ornamentation of the table, though limited in  extent, was in excellent taste, and perhaps quite as profuse os the unfortunately small
space devoted to the supper would permit. There were three leading and conspicuous pieces form the confectioner's hands, placed at
approprote points in the centre and at each end of the table; in the centre, our imposing Capitol--perfect in minature; at one end an 
exquisite representation of the heroic deeds of the gallant army; at the other, a similar device of the proud achievements of the navy. 
The representation of the Capitol was admirably executed; no detail seemed to be too minute for imitation. Even the lamps at the 
entrance seemed to give forth light. The columns, pedastals, cornices, frieses, entablatures, windows, situary, and the majectis dome, and towering above all 
else, the Goddess of Liberty, were all there as perfect as mould and model could make them. In addition, there were several allegorical
representations of the progress of civilization, the genius, the arts, the sciences and literature of the day. The piece on the
right was in honor of the army; and the glory and fame of the defenders of our liberty were illustrated by a pyramid, around which were 
clustered in tasteful profusion all the insignia of war, the paraphernalia of battle and the emblem of victory. The navy was honored in the same manner, 
the representation being surmounted with Admiral Farragut's old flagship Hartford, gallantly riding the withe crested waves, while
aloft might be seen the Admiral himself lashed to the rigging, emblematical of the old hero's achievements in the Bay of 
Mobile; then battered Fort Sumter, the sad epitome of secession; then Neptune with chariot and trident, and the Goddess of Liberty,
inspiring the brave sailor to greater glory and higher fame. There were other ornamentations, principally pyramids of which
 the detail is unimportant, for nougats, croquant, and chocolate are the same here as elsewhere. The bill of fare provided a select and tasteful
variety, and no better idea of it can be obtained than by inserting it right here verbatim.

"This was the programme for the feast. The only thing which did not seem promising was the fact that but three hundred could be confortably
accomodated at one time, while there were five thousand persons to be accomodated, and a large majority of them ladies. About the hour
of 12, the Presidential party were secorted by a private entrance to the privileged places. Soon afterward the doors were opened, and
a throng of more than a thousand, who had collected at that end of the hall, poured into the supper-room . Of course,
when three persons occupy the space barely sufficient for one, a 'crush' is the result; and the crush which followed can
better be imagined than depicted. 
<p>
"But this was not the worst feature. With the indecency of conduct and want of politeness and 
etiquette which charcterizes man American people at table, and which is the certain accompaniment of a large grows at a public supper, many
gentlemen, and ladies, seized upon the most ornamental and least nutritious part of the table decorations, demolished them, carried the pieces off
in a handkerchief or crushed them under foot. Then the more substantial viands were served likewise. Large dishes of choice meats, tatetes, saldes and 
jellies were carried off vi et armis into the alcoves, or elsewhere. One gentleman presented a very ludicrous attitude with a large plate of
smoked tongue, requiring both hands to hold it, no place to sit down, and no way to eat it! He looked the picture of despair. 
<p>
"In less than an hour the tables was a
wreck; a few ornaments not destroyed were removed, and the array of empty dishes and the debris of the feast were postitively frightful to
behold. The doors were now wide open, and hundreds of ladies in elegant silks, satins and velvets, and gentlemen in dainty broadcloath, 
surged and struggled back and forth. A few obtained something to eat, others very little, and many more only succeded in ruing their
toilets. As much was wasted as was eaten, and however much may have been provided more than half the guests went supperless. By
it was a public supper; we were not much disappointed, and though the gentlemen who managed it may have been to blame for the want of 
room, the fact remains that the supper was a disaster, and detracted from the otherwise pleasant aspect of the occasion."

<p>
Butter, Sweet potatoes, Sugar, Raisins, Allspice and cinnamon, Cloves, Nutmeats, Cane Syrup or molasses, Eggs.<br.
To be authentic, you must bake this pudding slowly in a heavy iron skillet. First, melt 1/2 cup butter. Set aside. Mix 4 cups grated raw 
sweet potatoes with 1/2 cup sugar, 1 cup raisins, 1 teaspoon each cinnamon and allspice, 1/2 teaspoon cloves, 1/2 cup chopped
nuts, and 1 cup cane syrup or molasses. Add 3 eggs and mix all together well. Pour into the hot skillet with the butter in int, and
stir until all the mixture is heated. Put the skillet into a moderate (325 degrees F.) oven. When a crust forms around the edge and
the top, turn the puding under, allowing crust to form again. Repeat this after a while. Pudding takes about 30 to 40 minutes to bake. The
iron skillet is an important ingredient in making this pudding authentic, as it causes the pudding to be dark in color, similar to a
plum pudding. Traditionally, the pudding is served with Damson preserves accompanying it. Otherwise plain cream is used. No 
Southerner worth his salt (or sweet potato) would top the pudding with whipped cream. But as Northern outsiders, we find it equally
delicious all three ways. Serves 8."<br>

<font color="#003366" size=+1>Ulysses S. Grant</font><p>

"The inauguration of General Ulysses Simpson Grant in 1869 did more than usher into the Presidency an honored war hero. It launched an era of opulence the like of 
which the United States had not seen before and has seldom seen since. There is irony in the fact that U.S. Grant, the simplest of men, should have had an 
administration renowend for its gaudy, lavish disply of all the material vanities of the age...The new President and his wife...were catapulted from the humdrum routine of 
years of dreary army existence to a world they had never known...A man of simple tastes, President Grant perhaps thought his years in the White House would be a mere 
continuation of the previous years...As soon as the Grants moved into the White House, the new President brought with him as cook a quartermaster from his army days. 
Julia [Grant's wife] refrained from comment at first, but it soon became obvious that the "chef" considered the White House dining room simply an enlarged mess hall, with 
quantity the chief ingredient to be considered. To him turkey represented the sine que non of any dinner. He planned turkey for a formal dinner, and varied the menu for a 
state dinner by having a bigger turkey...It wasn't long before Julia found a replacement. She hired an Italian steward named [Valentino] Melah, who had catered for some of
 the nation's most fashionable hotels. From the moment Melah entered the White House the cuisine changed radically. Turkey fled. In its place Melah offered a 
twenty-five-course dinner, often consisting of partridge, filet of beef, and myriad other elaborate concoctions of the era. Melah's special talent was for opulent 
banquets...Culinarily speaking, Julia was a creampuff in Melah's hands. She literally turned the planning and execution of officail entertainments over to his capable 
management...Melah was a wine connoisseur; consequently, the wines accompanying White House dinners were exemplary...At private, quite family dinners, Melah's fine
 Italian hand was barely discernible. Here the simple tastes of the old soldier held sway. The president adhered to a military punctuality at mealtime...Mealtimes with the 
family were especially happy occasions...when the Grants were truly alone, the President loved to frolic with his children, and the dinner hour often became play time...It
 was the President's habit to roll his bread into tiny balls and shoot the balls as ammunition at Nellie and Jesse [two of his children]...Grant retained a fondness for plain 
cooking...The one large meal that President Grant indulged in was breakfast. Leaner, more Spartan days, when breakfast consisted of cucumbers and coffee, may have
 been responsible for his insistence on a hearty morning meal. A favorite breakfast consisted of broiled Spanish mackerel, steak, bacon and fried apples, flannel cakes or
 buckwheat cakes, and a cup of strong black coffee--plain fare by bounteous. At other meals, the President showed partiality for roast beef, wheat (or wheaten) bread, and
 boiled hominy. His fondness for simple <a href="presidents.html#melahpudding">rice pudding</a> was almost a mania."<br>

<p>
""[Melah's] state dinner were...rated as successful...The table seated thirty-six without improvising, and dinners for that number were given almost every week. This is how
 The Olivia Letters [penned by Emily Edson Briggs, a Washington newspaper correspondent] describes one of these elegant dinners: 'In the beginning of the feast, fruit, 
flowers, and sweetmeats grace the tables, while bread and butter only give a Spartan simplicity to the 'first course,' which is composed of a French vegetables oul, and 
according to the description by those who have tasted it, no soup, foreign or domestic, has ever been known to equal it. The ambrosial soup is followed by a French 
croquet of meat. Four admirably trained servants remove the plates between each course, and their motions are as perfect as clockwork...The third 'course' of the dinner is
 composed of a fillet of beef, flanked on each side by potatoes the size of a walnut, with plenty of mushrooms to keep them company. The next coruse is dainty in the 
extreme. It is made up entirely of luscious leg of partridges, and baptized by a French name entirely beyond my comprehension. It will readily be seen that a full 
description of the twenty-nine courses would be altogether too much for the healthy columns of a newspaper to bear, so we pass to the dessert...The dessert is 
inaugurated by the destruction of a rice pudding, it is a pudding as would make our grandmothers clap their hands with joy. After the rice pudding, canned peaches, pears,
 and quinces are served. The follow confectionery, nuts, ice-cream, coffee, and chocolate, and with these warm, soothing drinks the presidential entertainment comes to
 an end, and the host and his guests repair to the Red Room.' ...Many of the state dinners consisted of twenty-nine courses with a break after the entree for Roman punch 
to fortify the guests. A dinner for thirty-six during this administration might cost as much as $2,000, although the average cost was about $700. For these dinners the State 
Dining Room was elaborately decorated with garlands of roses and evergreens festooning the ceiling and walls...The centerpiece was often a solid silver ship..."<br>

<b>"Julia's Veal Rolls</b><br>
When the newly married Grants were entertaining for the first time--having four or five of Ulysses' fellow officers to dinner--Julia was terrified. She had come from a 
slave-holding Missouri family and had been brought up with no knowledge at all of cooking. Her husband reassured her, telling her that he could 'run up a savory mess 
himself, if need be. He had roasted apples at West Point and had even been known to cook a fowl.' Julia survived the ordeal of that first company dinner and went on to 
become a respectable cook, as this recipe will testify. It was one of her favorites, later given to the Galena Presbyterian Church. <p>

they are put in the skillet, with butter and onions chopped fine; when done lay them in a dish. Make their gravy and pour over them. Take the threads off and garnish with

According to the historians, Mr. Garfield really liked squirrel soup:
<p>
"The attempt to interest the patient [James A. Garfield, after he was shot July 2, 1881] in food is
also recorded by Colonel Crook, the Disbursing Officer of the White House. He says that the
consulting doctors thought the appetite for the ill man might be tempted if he could have some
squirrel soup, of which he was very fond. For this purpose, Crook was given a permit to shoot
squirrels on the grounds of the Soldiers' Home. Unfortunately, the President never got well
enough for the Colonel even to go after the squirrels."<br>

<p>
<i>The Presidents' Cookbook</i>, Poppy Cannon (p. 302-307) states that  James A Garfield preferred
healthy, nutritious food over rich European dishes. His wife, Lucrezia, was an excellent bread
baker. Garfield's favorite drink was milk. When he was dying, the Adams Express Company in
Baltimore sent a cow to the White House to ensure a fresh supply of milk. This book lists these
recipes as Garfield's favorites: Soda bread, Insipiration bread, Extra-fluffy mashed potatoes,
Parsnips a la Garfield, Garfield pie (apple), Garfield herbal tea & Spice tea.

“Garfield had for years suffered from severe stomach ailments. He had endured chronic dysentery during the Civil War and later battled dyspepsia…Garfield…carefully 
controlled his diet, even carrying with him to Congress a lunch that his doctors had prescribed—a sandwich of raw beef on stale bread.”<br>

[NOTE: This book does not reveal whether or not President Garfield liked this sandwich.]

“Most days, Garfield was able to keep down a little bit of oatmeal. Unfortunately, that happened to be the one food he despised. Although Garfield found it difficult to eat anything, for a while at least he seemed to relish drinking a glass of milk. He dutifully swallowed the koumiss, a drink made from fermented horse milk, that [Dr.] Bliss gave him nearly every day, but he strongly preferred cow’s milk. Eager to help in any way, Americans latched onto this small piece of information. So that the president might have the freshest possible milk, a company in Baltimore sent him an Alderny cow, which could be seen tied ip on the White House lawn. The White House cook, who was the only Catholic among the staff, poured a large glass of milk for Garfield every day. Just before she carried his tray up the winding servant stairs to his sickroom, she quietly sprinkled holy water into his glass.”<br>

<font color="#003366" size=+1>Theodore Roosevelt</font><p>
Teddy Roosevelt approached food with the same zeal he employed in aspects of his maverick career. This President had 
definate 
culinary opinions and specific favorite foods. General notes here:
<p>
"The Roosevelts were a comfortably affluent family who could eat what thy liked. What they
liked happened to be simple--not Spartan, as some reports have suggested--but good simplicity in
hearty helpings. For breakfast, the President had hard-boiled eggs with rolls and coffee. He
varied this occasionally by having a big bowl of hominy with salt and butter. Teddy had set ideas,
within the limitations of his food preferences, of just how his food should be prepared. The
eggs must be hard boiled, not medium or soft. Rolls must be homemade and served in great
quantities. Coffee, too, was consumed in volume. Ted, Jr., recalled that his father's coffee cup
was "more in the nature of a bathtub." If the president lunched alone, he had a bowl of milk,
sometimes with crackers, sometimes not. But he was capable of eating quantities of food if the
occasion arose. One observer, O.K. Davis, said, "I have seen him eat a whole chicken and drink
four large glasses [of milk] at one meal, and chicken and milk were by no means the only things
served."
     Lunch with the family usually consisted of cold meat (often leftovers), freshly baked bread,
cantaloupe in season, and tea. Family dinners were often three-course affairs, but sometimes only
two. The food was generously served by unpretentious. The White House received many gifts of
game, an undending delight to Teddy. He was also very fond of chicken, as has been implied, and
had pronounced ideas on service it, saying once: "The only way to serve fried chicken is with
white gravy soaked into the meat." 
     Steak was a popular food with the President...He had a great sweet tooth and usually used as
many as seven lumps of sugar in his coffee...Hominy was a staple at the Roosevelt table. In
addition to being part of breakfast, it was often served as a starch at lunch and dinner, with meat
gravy over it...T.R.'s one great gourmet interest was exotic teas...Ku-Kwa was a favorite...Teddy
Roosevelt also expressed admiration for the famous Caravan tea...The President was far less fond
of alcohol. At informal dinners with friends, only one wine was served, a far cry from the
previous adminstrations' six and seven glasses. It is possible that alcohol did not agree with
T.R."<br>

"While Roosevelt loved to eat, the dinner table to him was less an occasion for fine dining than a springboard for conversation
in which he played the prime role. (p. 115)..."With the exception of the President's love for Caracvan and Hu-Kwa tea, he had little
use for exotic food or drink, or even for alcohol. Although many unknowing oververs clucked that the President used his huge
golden goblet to slurp whiskey, in fact he usually drank form it a mixture of white wine and sparkling water. Roosevlet had an outdoorsman's
taste for game of all kinds, fried chicken, and steak, and a sweet tooth for cookies. Other preferences included a fondness for all
manner of greens (fiddleheads and dandelions, in particular); shad and shad roe; liver and bacon for breakfast; kidney stew; Indian
pudding; and mint tea...ome sophisticated visitors were taken aback at the simplicity and relative absence of alchoholic
refreshment at Sagamore Hill; others reveled in the same simplicity, like the Englishman who exclaimed over his luncheon of 'bouillon,
some lamb chops and new peas and potatoes, and watermelon for dessert.' (p. 126-127)...Oysters were said to be a Roosevelt
favorite." (p. 129)<br>

In June 1906 a syndicated column published in the <i>Washington Post</i> "outed" TR and his family for indulging in 
extravagant dining practices. TR responded in kind the next day in the same paper:<p>
"The President indicates that but one correct inference can be gleaned from a syndicate story appearing tin the [Washington] Post yesterday, which purports to describe at some length the culinary department of the Executive Mansion, and that is that the occupants of the White House partake of the ordinary three meals a day. The menu card supplied but the author of the Executive Mansions pure-food story might, indeed, be interesting reading, suggested the President, if it portrayed facts. But when any one endeavors to create a widespread impression that the President and his family sit down to a four or five course breakfast, a six or seven course luncheon, and a ten-course dinner, the President feels that a denial is not inappropriate. Instead of a breakfast consisting of oranges, cantaloupes, cereals, eggs, bacon, lamb chops, hot cakes, and waffles, President Roosevelt insists that the regular White House breakfast consists of hard boiled eggs, rolls, and coffee. Instead of a luncheon of such delicious viands as Little Neck clams, stuffed olives, celery, consommé of chicken, fish sauté, eggs a la turque, Spring lamb, new string beans, asparagus, mashed potatoes, lettuce, tomatoes, strawberries , and ice cream, President Roosevelt declares that when alone he always contents himself with a bowl of bread and milk. When Mrs. Roosevelt or the children are present, the luncheon consists of cold meat, if there is any left over, tea, cantaloupe in season, and bread. Instead of a ten-course dinner, including almost everything in the list of edibles, the President declares that nine times out of ten a three-course dinner is served, and the other time a two-course dinner. The paragraph in the culinary story referring to the fact that the President and his family 'eat about the same things as are eaten by other American families in comfortable circumstances,' the President declares to be accurate if segregated form the balance of the story. But when taken in connection with the published menu cards, the President sarcastically inquires how many comfortable American families serve such meals. Upon the statement that 'every article of food that goes to the White House table is carefully inspected' the President humorously admits that the cook looks over the potatoes to see that no bad ones get into the pot, but that such espionage over edibles is all that is contemplated. The assertion that the White House marketing is all done at the Central Market might be true but for the fact that none of the marketing is done at the Central Market. Pinckney, the White House steward, is credited with being clothed with entire authority in buying provisions. Sometimes the President says Pinckney does buy some fruit, but that he never buys other provisions. Special mention made of asparagus consumed at the White House as being purchased through the market is all wrong, declares the President, as all asparagus eaten at the White House comes from the President's estate at Oyster Bay. The interesting declaration that Quentin is permitted to have all the sugar he wants in his demi-tasse loses some of its flavor in the light of the President's declaration that Quentin never drinks coffee."

<b>Fat Rascals</b><br>
In Edith Roosevelt's most cherished cookbook, which now rests on a shelf in the parlour of Sagamore Hill, is this recipe for hot
biscuits. Served right from the oven, with butter on them, they make a delicious coffee-klatch or teatime snack. We like to
serve them as well at breakfast, as a change from coffee cake or rolls. One taste and you will see why Teddy Roosevelt enjoyed
breakfast so much--eggs, coffee, and rolls....<br>
Flour<br>
salt<br>
Sugar<br>
Baking powder<br>
Butter<br>
Currants<br>
Milk<br>
Sift 4 cups flour wtih 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 cup sugar, and 4 teaspoons baking powder. Mix well. Cut in 1 1/2 cups butter. Then stir in 1 pound
dried currants. Mix well again and add 1 cup milk, little by little. With each addition, mix with a fork until a soft dough
forms. Roll the dough approximately 1/2 inch thick on a lightly floured board. use a 2-inch round cutter to shape the biscuits.
Bake biscuits on an ungreased cooky sheet until nicely browned. Bake in a hot (450 degrees F.) oven about 12 minutes. Whe done, 
remove from oven, split and butter each biscuit, and serve piping hot. Makes approximately 2 dozen."
<p>
<b>Sagamore Hill Sand Tarts</b><br>
Sweets, especially cookies, were a Roosevelt weakness. The President gobbled cookies such as these sand tarts as fast as they
appeared on the plate. This recipe, particularly cherised one in the family, was found on the inside cover of one of Edith
Roosevelt's many cookbooks. The family offered these cookies to friends who dropped in Christmas morning. Served with hot coffee...
<br>
Butter<br>
Sugar<br>
Eggs<br>
Vanilla<br>
Flour<br>
Cream 1 cup butter until it is as smooth as mayonnaise. Then add 2 cups sugar and cream until light and fluffy. Add 2 eggs, one by 
one, beating after each addition. Beat in one additional egg yolk and 2 teaspoons vanilla. Stir in 4 cups sifted flour. Mix again well.
Roll the dough on a lightly floured board until quite thin. Cut with a 2 1/2-inch cooky cutter. The beat remaining egg white
just enough to stir it up a bit. Brush the egg white on top of the cookies. Sprinkle with a cinnamon-sugar mixture and bake on a
greased cooky sheet in a moderate (350 degrees F.) oven for about 8 minutes. Makes 6 dozen."<br>

<font color="#003366" size=+1>William Howard Taft</font><br>
A classic "Steak and Potatoes" man who enjoyed contemporary fine dining.
<p>
"Steak spelled with a big 'S' was the favorite food of William Howard Taft. When the Chief Justice started to eat stea, it did not
matter much to him what the meal was. As a matter of fact, according to the late Ike Hoover, of the White House staff, when Taft
was President there was always steak for his breakfast. Naturally, Mrs. Taft saw to it that steak appeared every morning for her husband.
Toward the end of his life he had to modify his diet and steak became more of a luxury. Generally Mrs. Taft would order some form
of potaotes to go with the steak. The former President was fond of hashed brown potatoes, if his diet did not interfere. The steak was always
broiled in this method:<br><blockquote>
<b>Broiled Steak</b><br>
Select a T-Bone, tenderloin or sirloin. Wipe the meat dry, remove the outside skin and some of the fat if there is a large quantity
 of it. Then, with some of the removed fat, grease the broiler. Place the steak on the broiler over a clear fire or under the gas
flame; sear quickly on both sides to prevent the juices escaping. Turn again and cook on both sides until done, 10 to 15 minutes
for a medium thick steak if deseried rare; allow a few minutes longer if steak is preferered well done. RRemove to hot platter, sprinkle with
salt and pepper and stpread with soft butter."<br>

"Taft would have had to defer to several others when the title of Presidential gourmet was awarded, but there is no doubt he deserved
the award as leading gourmand. Some of his "snacks" have become legendary. On a visit to Savannah, he once breakfastaed on grapefruit,
potted partridge, broile venison, grilled partridge, waffles with maple syrup and butter, hominy, hot rolls, bacon, and more venison...A
typical Taft lunch might include bouillon, smelts with tartar sauce, lamb chops, Bermuda potatoes, green peas, and--for dessert--
raspberry jelly with whipped cream, salted almonds, bonbons, and coffee. Like his predecessor and mentor, Teddy Roosevelt, Taft
was a great coffee consumer. Dinner some hours later would be, typically, lobster stew, salmon cutlets with peas, roast
cold tenderloin with vegetable salad, cold tongue and ham, followed by frozen pudding, cake, fruit, and coffee...At home, under
the watchful eyes of a well-meaning wife, he might dociley nibble at his eight-ounce breakfast steak, his two oranges, several
pieces of toast and butter, all washed down with quantities of coffee with cream and sugar...But on the road he let himself
go...President Taft enjoyed entertaining...the first diplomatic tea...[served] Lobster a la Newburg, chicken pates, salad, rolls,
an assorted sandwiches...as well as ice cream, cakes, candies, coffee, and punch. It was a spread in the Taft tradition...
The President was fond of waffles for breakfast...The only breakfast dish that President Taft would not eat was eggs--he
could not abide them...One of President Taft's favorite luncheon dishes was terrapin [turtle] soup...[Taft also enjoyed] Billi Bi...
a cream of mussels soup...the President dearly loved all kinds of seafood...William Howard Taft did not care how elaborate the
food was as long as it was attractively served--and served in quantity. Bake ham filled the bill every time...Salads were a
special favorite, almost a perennial on the Taft luncheon and dinner tables...peach salad was held in high esteem...One of Taft's
weaknesses was salted almonds...."<br>

piece de resistance will be baked possum, with baked sweet potatoes on the right of him, on the left of him, under him and heaped over
him. The possum was included in the bill of fare at Mr. Taft's request...Leading up to the "possum and taters," there will be the

frequently requested by Wilson as a luncheon dish. An once, when he was to visit friends who lived ouside Washington in the 
Virginia countryside, he wrote ahead--in an untypical burst of gustatorial ferver: 'I am very fond of country hams, peach
cobblers, butter and buttermilk, fresh eggs, hot biscuits, homemade ice cream and plain white cake.' This contrasts oddly with

"President Coolidge vastly preferred the family dinner table to formal banquets, yet it seems taht it was only in the Coolide era 
that the President, his wife, and one or two of their children dined in evening clothes in the State Dining Room--even when
ther were no guests...President Coolidge had more odd ideas about food than perhaps any other White House resident. For one thing, 
he insisted up referring to all meals as supper even if they were actually breakfast or luncheon or a formal state dinner. For
another, he generally breakfasted (or supped, as it were) on hot cereal prepared in the White House kitchen by combining three
parts whole wheat and one part whole rye, cooed in its unground state. And then there was the ceaseless nibbling...Unnoticed by the guests,
a waiter would slip a plate of roast beef before the President, no matter what entree was being served officially...[Coolidge]

yard built in back of the White House and kept a small flock of Vermont chickens there. Somehow, chickens from this coop,
when prepared for the White House table, had a curiously fragrant and mysterious flavor. Investigation showed that Coolidge's

served--sometimes out of season, often imported. And this policy extended to the servants, who were apt to be cheered, when home 
ill, by a basket of food and flowers sent with Mrs. Hoover's card. Mrs. Hoover never questioned the amount of food consumed or its
cost. Her only requirement was that it be of the best quality, well cooked and well served. But her interest in things culinary
was from her desk where she interviewed the housekeeper and the cook...President Hoover was an extremely rapid eater, and the
kitchen staff used to make bets as to how long it would take him to speed through a meal...Despite the formality of the
household, the Hoovers were not demanding. It has been said by members of their staff that our 31st president was one of the
easiest men in the world to please...President Hoover used to go down to Opelousas, Louisiana, to eat gumbo at a small 
restaurant he particularly liked...Although an inlander, Hoover was particularly fond of lobster...President Hoover liked 
[Virginia Ham] especially...In the Hoover household [Egg Timbales]...was a frequent luncheon dish. The President invariably, so we

he ate in his life came from his Aunt Millie's kitchen...after his wife died...the former President...still clung to many of his

of this and some of that and a pinch of sethinge else and turing out a dish to make the mouth water and the hair curl...'Mr. Hoover is the
easiest man in the world to please,' she said...[he] l;ikes corn soup and cream potato soup and roast lamb, and he is 
particularly fond of Virginia ham. Yes, I made up my own recipe for baked ham, I take a midly cured ham, wash it and soak it
overnight, and then I put it on in cold water waith the skin side down and add two cupfuls of brown sugar and two cupfuls of cinegar. 
I let is come to a boil and then simmer slowly until the skin puckers. Then I take it off the stove and let it cool in the water. 
That keeps the juices in the meat. The I skin it and rub it all over with currant jelly. And I always make my currant jelly myself. 
Then I sprinkle the ham with breadcrumbs and brown it in the oven...Meanwhile Mary dragged out of the oven a fragrant apple pie
flavored with lemon nutmeg and covered with marshmallow meringue..."<br>

"'And here is another of Mrs. Hoover's favorite dishes. It is my own recipe and I call it 'Maryland caramel tomatoes.' Incidentally, that name is a tribute to Mary's native State, but she 
spent fifty years in Washington cooking for many people prominent in national life...'You cut off the tops of the tomatoes--leave the stem--and make a cavity in the top, and fill each hole
 with a good-sized piece of butter--not a stingy piece-and put a tablespoonful of sugar on each tomato. Sprinkle with salt, and put in the oven to cook until the sugar is brown and the 
tomato done but not flat. Stick a sprig of parsley in the top of each tomato and serve on rounds of toast with sauce of the tomato. That makes a very pretty dish,' Mary concluded."<br>

The Great Depression, Prohibition and WWII were times best known for scarcity and "making-do." FDR was reared in the 
comfort of family wealth and tradition. Eleanor was social-minded and had no problem breaking all of the rules. Their 
dinner tables, both public and private, reflected the fact that opposites attract. Confusing, intriguing, 
well-intentioned, sacrificing, inspired. No one knew what they were going to eat for dinner. <a href="presidents.html#fdrhotdogs">
Hot dogs</a> served to the Queen of 
England. Often criticized by period political and culinary experts, FDR's tables were actually a brilliant reflection of his time.
<p>
Most of the food-related information published about FDR's Administration concentrates on <a href="presidents.html#eleanorfavorites">
Eleanor Roosevelt</a>. Sara Roosevelt, FDR's mother,
presided as the matriarch of Springwood, Hyde Park. The friction between Eleanor and Sara is well documented. We may actually never know what Franklin, the man, liked to eat.
<p>
"The Roosevelts enjoyed hearty, typically American food--like creamed chipped beef, bread puddings, and fried cornmeal mush...
Welsh rabbits (or rarebits) were a family favorite for Sunday-night suppers, and cheeses of all types were always on hand for
Roosevelt snacks or desserts. The family liked doughnuts both at breakfast and teatime...The President took his breakfast
on a tray in his room. His choice of coffee was a dark French roast, prepared in the White House kitchens from green coffee
beans. A coffee maker was placed on the President's breakfast tray so that he could regulate the brewing to his satisfaction....
Luncheon was not really a family meal for the President. Very often he would lunch at his desk from a tray...Dinner brought the
Roosevelt family together...Sunday-night suppers at the White House were intimate occasions...Supper consisted of Mrs. Roosevelt's
 scrambled eggs, ham, bacon, or sausage, a dessert and coffee...Mrs. Roosevelt...redesign[ed] the kitchens, equipping them with 
electric stoves and dishwashers..."<br>

"Left to themselves, the Roosevelts were the plainest sort of people, so far as eating habits went. What we served family fashion
in the White House was thet simplest of American cookery, of the standards set my Mrs. Sara Delano Roosevlet, or "Mrs. James," as
we call her, and which were preferred by her president son. Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt went along with their tastes, since hers didn't
run so much to food. But she wanted the best to be given the guests, for, after the President, the White House guest was king...
Most of the recipe used came from my own family files, because there wasn't a single recipe card, not even a cookbook, left
in the White House when I went in, along with the Roosevelt family, back in 1933. If ever humans were what their eating habits
were, it was the Roosevelts. The President and his family liked the hearty, vitamin-filled dishes that are typically America. Regularly we
served creamed chipped beef and corned beef hash and poached eggs, because they wanted these dishes, and they liked bread pudding.
The loved fried corn-meal mush with maple sirup, sometimes even as a dessert...They desserts they liked best were fruit 
and cheese...I don't think Mr. and Mrs. Roosevelt would ever have ordered a canape themselves. They just weren't the hors-
d'oeuvre sort...Caviar was often sent in as gifts by the Russians, and someimes we had presents of pate de foie gras--two
delicacies the President liked. he was also very fond of terrapin. These and heavy cream were hsi only luxurious tastes."<br>

<p>
"There never was such a family for soups as the Roosevelts. All the years they occupied the White House we kept the big steel soup
kettles singing in the White House--clear soup for dinner and cream soup for lunch. Pretty nearly every usable variety of fish,
fowl, beast, mineral, vegetable, and condiment was used in our White House soups...Give Mrs. Roosevelt a bowl of soup and a dish of 
fruit for lunch and she'd be off with recharged vitality on one of her trips. She always ordered something light for lunch if she
was going awa. Cream of almond--L'Amande soup--was one of her special favorites...The President was partial to fish soups...
Among the recipes his mother gave me was the one for clam chowder...Another of his favorites was the green turtle soup, and there
was always a great fuss when it was made...I remember making it for Will Rogers and other celebrities. We served soup in the White House form
eleven in the monring on--for every meal, in fact, except breakfast....We served Fairy Toast with the White House soups. This toast 
which is sliced even thinner than Melba. We also served toast fingers, which is toast cut in narrow strips, and bread sticks, and
sometimes whole-wheat crackers, and saltines."<br>
---<i>ibid</i> (p. 8-9)
<p>
"Birthdays, of course, were special White House occasions and we went to great pains with the cakes...We used twenty-one candles 
always; no one ever grew any odler than that in the White House, at least on their birthdays. We always had angel food for Mrs. Roosevelt's birthday and fruitcake for the President's, the latter made by the old English recipe
my husband's mother brought from Ireland. But the original recipe called for currants, which I consider too dry, so I 
substituted chopped dates. 'Perfectly delicious,' the President always said."<br>
---<i>ibid</i>, (p. 160)
<p>
"The Roosevelts liked doughnuts, either at breakfast or teatime, and I made them by the hundreds at Hyde Park. I used to make the Berliner
pfann kuchen for the Roosevelts, which are the small round cookie-sized dougnuts without holes and rolled in sugar. Once Mrs. Roosevelt
ordered twenty-four dozen of them at one time for the governor's mansion. We served them at the White House too."<br>

recipe my husband's mother brought from Ireland...Candy was always brought on with the coffee. Nuts were on the table...
Apple pie was the President's preference among pies."---ibid (p. 160-161)
<p>
"The Roosevelts liked cheese as an appetizer, in salads, for snacks, and as a main course, or a dessert, and I often thought it
was the President's favorite dessert. He liked Camembert, Roquefort, Swiss, Gruyere, and Liederkranz...along with sharp
American cheese that was the mainstay of many a meal and also had to be kept on hand for the any-old-hour sandwiches and 
the Welsh rabbits made for Sunday-night suppers and family buffet."---ibid (p. 138)
<p>
"...the Roosevelts were unusually fond of fish...There was nothing the President liked better than Lake Superior whitefish, 
boned and planked...Lobsters were great favorites of his, and a blessing during the rationing period. We served the cold, stuffed,
broiled, boiled, in salad, Imperial, Newburg, Thermidor...Kedigree was served over and over during the thirteen years, and Mrs.
Roosevelt liked it best of all. The President loved kippered herring for breakfast, also salt mackerel."---ibid (p. 23-24)
<p>
"If there is one cut of meat that bespeaks America to my mind it is steak. When President Roosevelt fell ill...suddenly he
spoke the words that made the skies open up again. 'I'd like a steak,' the President said."<br>

<b>Is it true Eleanor Roosevelt at chocolate-coated garlic pills every morning?</b><br>
Yes, but we do not know when she started the practice. In her own words:<br>
"Today I still feel that I am largely responsible for keeping myself in good health. My physician, Dr. David Curewitsch, seems to 
expect his patients to have a certain amount of common sense. I take the vitamin pills he prescribes and also some chocolate-coated

<a name="eleanorscrambled">
<b>Eleanor Roosevelt's scrambled eggs were a legendary fixture in the Roosevelt family's Sunday suppers</b>.<br>
"The Franklin Roosevelts had a Sunday night ritual that involved the First Lady and was greatly enjoyed by guests who were made
to feel a part of the family because of it. Mrs. Roosevelt mnade a chafing dish of scrambled eggs right at the table as guests and
family sat talking. But there was a bit more to the menu than that:

FDR liked to play bartender. He liked martinis and would whip them up for his guests on Sunday nights while his wife busied
herself with the scrambled eggs."<br>
---<i>A Treasury of White House Cooking</i>, Francois Rysavy [G.P. Putnam's Sons:New York] 1957 (p. 254)

<p>
 "Mrs. Roosevelt's scrambled eggs are a favorite dish with the President any time. His fondness
for them has already paid him handsomely politicaly, for he won a round of grins from a Southern audience recently by assuring them
that he preferred scrambled eggs to 'grilled millionare' for breakfast. At Sunday night suppers, besides at breakfast, scrambled 
eggs are the White House dish. The little ritual, with Mrs. Roosevelt fixing the eggs on a chafing dish at the supper table, has been 
a famly institution fo years. It was inaugurated by Mrs. Roosevelt as a bride, when her brother...was a regular week-end guest, and
has been continued ever since. The chafing dish is already hot when the ceremony begins. The ingredients are at hand. A liberal
amount of butter goes into the chafing dish first, then the eggs are cracked and dropped in. Mrs. Roosevelt mixes in about half a pint of 
milk or cream to a dozen eggs. She adds salt and pepper and beats the mixture vigorously with a fork while it is cooking. Care is
taken not to cook them too hard. It is all over in a few minutes. Then the members of the family or whoever else has showed up for Sunday
supper, get their scrambled eggs. For larger gatherings the eggs are broken and placed in the chafing dish before it is brought
in and placed on the table before Mrs. Roosevelt. For still larger affairs, the eggs are scrambled in the kitchen with careful 
observance of the recipe, and are brought in to be served by Mrs. Roosevelt."<br>
---"For Gourmets and Others: Fine Points of Egg Dishes," S. Wright, <i>New York Times</i>, January 15, 1939 (p. D7)
<p>
"Sunday-night suppers at the White House became a tradition during the Roosevelt administration. The marked the apex of the 
week, when the Roosevelt family and their friends relaxed for an informal breathing space between one week's affairs and the 
next. Scrambled eggs were a 'must' on these Sunday nights. Mrs. Roosevelt cooked them herself, in a silver chafing dish, and they were
particularly good because she used real cream instead of milk. Coming from Hyde Park, where they had the farm to supply them with the simpler
luxuries, the Roosevelts were accustomed to using all the cream they wanted. But when they went into the White House on the crest of the greatest
depression in history, and had to set and example of simple simple and substantial meals. We were closely observed...Eggs are health-giving and
 easily fixed and can be made into
many different dishes. We tried them out every way possible in the White House. But through depression and war the President
and Mrs. Roosevelt clung to cream. It was about the only luxury left that could be found in sizable quantities. The President
liked cream as thick as it could be had in his morning coffee, and Mrs. Roosevelt wanted cream for the scrambled eggs that were served every 
Sunday night in the White House through three presidential terms and what were enjoyed by all who came.

<b>Presidential hot dogs?</b><br>
<b>Fact:</b> Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt served hot dogs to dignitaries visiting the Summer White House (Springwood, Hyde Park NY) as early as 1934.<br>
<b>Fact:</b> Some people thought Eleanor purposely served hot dogs in Hyde Park to undermine the authority of Sara, her mother-in-law.<br>
<b>Fact:</b> The King and Queen of England were served hot dogs at FDR's Summer White House on June 11, 1939.<br>
<b>Fact:</b> The Royal couple was not offended by the menu.<br>
<b>You decide: </b> Was the real heat behind the alleged "royal hot dog" incident sparked by jealous family flames 
or was this a brilliant gesture hoping to unite everyone facing hard economic times? 
<p>
"A guest list more distinguished than usually graces a formal White House dinner was represented today at a "hot dog" luncheon
given by President Roosevelt at his cottage, located two miles from the Summer White House. Thre was no particular reason for the 
party except that this seemed to be the last opportunity for an al fresco picnic luncheon before the President's departure for 
Washington sometime next week. As it was, the rain spoiled the picnic plans, and the party was moved into the tiny cottage...Among those
present were Bernard M. Baruch...In the meantime the facilities of the small kitchen in the house were being taxed while Mrs.
Roosevelt and a group of her friends broiled weiners, baked macaroni and prepared great bowls of mixed vegetable and tomato
salad and coffee...Since the picnic obviously could not be held on the lawn, long tables were placed on the screened-on porch of
the cottage. A table was set in the living room of the cottage, where the president and his mother, Mrs. Sara Delano Roosevelt, 
who yesterday celebrated her eightieth birthday, were served. The guests, ranging from prominent ones to chauffeurs, found
paper plates, paper cups and knive and forks and filed past the serving tables in line. The various guests of honor were invited to 
take turns sitting at one table and chatting with the President."<br>
---"President is Host at 'Hot Dog' Feast," <i>New York Times</i>, September 23, 1934 (p. N1)
<p>
"President Roosevelt entertained Crown Princess Louise of Sweden and her party atop Dutchess Hill, the site of his future cottage
home, this afternoon, and the breezes that whistled thorugh the encircling oaks and pines carried before them the inviting smell
of typical American fare--hot dogs and coffee...The hot dogs were served at the insistence of Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, wife
of the president, Mrs. James Roosevelt, the President's 83-year-old-mother, who never eats the American road-side dish, had wanted 
to serve pork sausages on finger rolls, but these were ruled out by her daughter-in-law, the hostess of the day. The hot dogs, 
dripping with msutard, were tucked into the familiar rolls. They were washed down by beer. Although she held aloof from the hot 
dogs, the President's mother clung to a glass of beer. For her, ham and chicken sandwiches were added to the picnic menu."<br.
---"Roosevelts Treat Guests to Hot Dogs," <i>New York Times</i>, July 3, 1938 (p. 1)
<p>
"Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt, wife of the President, wants to give a picnic for them [the King and Queen of England], with hot dogs
if the weather is pleasantly cool, but thermometer should register 100 degrees in the shade, in which case more appropriate
refreshments will be provided. There probably will be a picnic, over which at present, however, a 'friendly family argument' is in
progress, Mrs. Roosevelt said today."<br>
---"Roosevelts Plan Hot Dogs for King," <i>New York Times</i>, May 18, 1939 (p. 21)
<p>
"King George VI ate his first hot dog, was chauffeured by the President of the United States and turned his own hand motion-picture
camera against his photographers at a typical Roosevelt picnic party today on the slope of Dutchess Hill, where the Chief Exceuctive's
new stone cottage provided an informal backdrop for a high point of the visit of the British sovereigns with the nation's First
Family...The King himself clinched the informality of the outing by going swimming with the President in the sping-fed tile pool
on the lawn of Mrs. Roosevelt's Val Kill cottage...There were no other swimmers, other guests who came from the picnic to have tea
 at the Val Kill cottage remaining about the lawn...The royal visitors and the other principal guests did not have to hold
paper plates on their laps. Tables had been arranged for them about the front porch under its gently sloping Dutch 
colonial roof...It was with some obvious misgivings that Mr. McDermott first conceded, in answer to questions, that the King had
eaten hot dogs at the picnic. He said that it was safe to assume that the King had done so since he had announced that he had been
looking forward to the chance of sampling the favorite American snack. Later it was ascertained that the King not only came
back for more hot-dog sandwiches but that he drank beer with them, the beer being served from a top manned by experts from
near-by Poughkeepsie. Added to the picnic fare were cold ham from various sections of the country, smoked and plain roast turkey, 
lettuce and tomato salad, soft drinks, hot and iced coffee and iced tea. The orange and lime soda pop seemed the favorite beverage
of those who stood or sat about the lawn or amid the shade trees, although a number of guests followed the example of the King and
drank beer."<br>

one time stated: "Never notice what's put before me. Learned in the army to eat what could be obtained and like it. In my outfit when a man kicked about the food,

"Like the Roosevelts, the Trumans did not care for elaborate food, but, unlike their predecessors, they demanded it better-cooked.
Mrs. Truman was a very good cook and she expected good cooking on her table...she brought with her to the White House Vietta Carr, the family
cook from Independence, who whould sometimes prepare special back-home dishes the family particularly liked...The President's
breakfast menu remained nearly constant: orange juice, grapefruit, or tomato juice; hot cereal in winter and cold cereal other times;
whoe-wheat tast and milk--sometimes buttermilk. The staff had to learn how to make coffee for the Trumans...This attention to detail
was typical of Bess Truman's attitude toward food. She gained the reputation of serving the best of home-cooked food, even 
for guests...President Truman described himself as a "meat and potatoes man," though he was actually a light eater...At one time when
the White House was giving a luncheon for Prime Minister Churchill...the President ordered the menu...oysters soup, celery 
hearts, assorted olives, filet mignon with mushrooms, watermelon pickles, asparagus hollandaise, grilled tomatoes, hard rolls, 
hearts of lettuce salad with Roquefort dressing, strawberry shortcake...Special family "receipts" were guarded in the 
"Confindential File."...Harry S. Truman was a Senator long before he was President, and he carried his fondness for [Senators' Bean Soup]
from one position to the other...Occasionally the Trumans would birng back from trips home to Missouri some sourghum molasses.
It was a family favorite served on cornbread...Cornmeal Dumplings with Turnip Greens...was enjoyed many times at Truman family

"The Eisenhowers never acquired the reputation for being gourmets. Mrs. Eisenhower was happy to be
with her husband alone at every meal, and many times the President and First Lady took their dinner on
trays while watching television. Gossips say the trays contained frozen TV dinners. When the President's
health made state dinners too exhausting, elaborate lunches were substituted as the official entertainment
for a visiting head of state and his wife...Soup were a favorite dish of the Eisenhowers. The president
himself sometimes cooked them...A cold weather favorite of President Eisenhower was...oxtail soup, a
truly hearty military dish... [NOTE: chicken noodle soup and cream of celery-clam soup Rysavy are also
mentioned.]...
General Eisenhower was a frequent guest at the Biddle home in both London and Paris. Three of the
distinguished dishes he particularly enjoyed when dining with the Biddles deserve a place in the annals:
Biddle boeuf a la mode, boeuf a la mode en gelee, and...cream of artichoke soup...An old Kansas fvorite
that President Eisenhower remembered from his early Midwest days, and asked for from the White House
kitchen, was succotash...President Eisenhower left the running of the house to his wife, with one
exception. He was very fond of cooking an occasional dish of a homely variety. Beef soup was one of his
specialties, and he would leave the soup simmering on the stove in the kitchen for hours, causing much
mouth-watering among the kitchen staff. As the President and Mrs. Eisenhower differed on the subject of
onions (he loved them, she hated them), this was his chance to indulge one of his favorite tastes..The
President loved garlic...One of President Eisenhower's favorite desserts was prune whip...Just like every
red-blooded American, President Eisenhower was fond of apple pie...Ike preferred his rice pudding
cooked the British way, which takes longer than making it from cooked leftover rice...A pitcher of heavy
cream passed with dessert is almost an Eisenhower trademark."<br>

"We know that General Eisenhower was a hero to his valet because a few years ago Sgt. Mickey said so in a book...Now ex-Sgt. 
Marty Snyder comes up with another angle: Ike at the groaning board as military and Presidential gourmet. Eisenhower endeared
himself to his mess sergeant because he knew and liked good food. Mess Sergeant Snyder first encountered Lieutenant Colonel
Eisenhower during the Louisiana maneuvers in '41. The colonel inspected the sergeant's kitchen. Snyder was breaking rules by
attempting to make the food tasty. Eisenhower approved the use of the spices that Snyder had bought out of his own pocket. Thus
began a friendship and an effort on Snyder's part to become the general's personal chef. He did so in 1944 and discovered a human
side to the general that was ennobling. Ike loved to cook himself, to eat simply but experimentally, and to see always that the
men on the lower levels were doing okay on the chow line. There are a number of neat anecotes about Eisenhower's knowledge of
food and where it comes from. For instance, when a cow was 'captured' and the mess hall men were trying to milk it unsuccessfully,
the general came along and in a few moments at the controls filled a large bucket. 'You city slickers have a lot to learn,' Ike 
said."<br>

"Eisenhower had several favorite recipes that he cooked for close friends at Camp David and other places of rest and relaxation. I have on
cripst White House stationary an original Eisenhower recipe titled 'President Eisenhower's recipe for old-fashioned beef stew.' 
Alex wiley, a senator from Wisconsin in the 1950s, sent this original recipe to my dear friend chef Milton F. Schoenbaum in Milwaukee...I have
taken the liberty of elaborating somewhat on the Eisenhower original by giving more exact measurements than
'bunch small carrots' or 'assorted spices.' But the recipe is authentic. In fact, it's unusual in that it starts with 'washed
meat' and adds the roux toward the end--but the result is a good stew, and that's what counts.<br>
<blockquote>
<b>President Eisenhower's Old-Fashioned Beef Stew</b><br>
2 pounds beef round, cubed<br>
2 (12-ounce) cans connsomme<br>
Water<br>
3 tablespoons shortening<br>
3 scant tablespoons flour<br>
1 pound small red potatoes, peeled<br>
2 cups 1-inch carrot pieces<br>
12 small onions<br>
1 cup chopped peeled tomatoes or 1 (8-ounce) can stewed tomatoes, drained and chopped<br>
Salt<br>
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br>1/4 teaspoon MSG (optional)<br>
1/2 teaspoon thyme<br>
2 bay leaves, crumbled<br>
1 clove garlic, halved lengthwise<br>
1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns, bruised<br>
1/2 teaspoon white peppercorns, bruised<br>
2 sprigs parsley or 1/2 teaspoon dried<br>
Wash beef cubes. While still wet, place in large heavy pot over medium heat. Cover and cook about 5 minutes. Stir, cover, and continue
cooking. Meanwhile, blend consomme with 2 1/2 cans water. Set aside. In saucepan heat shortening. Add flour and stir over medium 
heat until mixture turns medium brown. Remove from heat and add 1 cup connsome water mixture, stirring to blend. Add 1 to 1 1/2
cups more liquid until roux is smooth. Set aside. Add potatoes, carrots, onions and tomatoes to meat. Stir in salt to taste, pepper and 
MSG. Make bouquet garni by tying thume, bay leaves, garlic, black and white peppercorns and parsley in square of cheesecloth with
 long string. Add bouquet garni to pot along with remaning consomme. Cover and simmer 30 to 45 minutes until beef and vegetables are
tender. Into roux stir some of hot liquid from stew pot until smooth and liquid. Stir warmed roux mixture into stew. Cover and cook over low heat another
30 minutes. Serve with crusty French bread. Makes 6 to 8 servings.

To make a meal of it, start with something light, such as a half a grapefruit, and follow with a good piece of Midwestern cheese and a fine
pear or apple.<br>
WINE TIP: It was never much of a secret that Eisenhower enjoyed a glass of red wine with his favorite food, beef. It tried but
could not discover his favorite wine. But as I understand it, he preferred burgundy types."<br>

Thanks to Mrs. Kennedy, official White House Kennedy tables compared favorably to Jefferson's: classic French cuisine 
reigned supreme. Trendy Americans embraced everything French. James Beard and Julia Child taught us how to cook. This makes us wonder: did our 35th president truly love French food (as Jefferson), 
or did he prefer something different when dining in private?
<p>
"We can not verify that this was President John F. Kennedy's favorite breakfast, but he did prefer orange juice, poached eggs on toast, crisp broiled bacon,
 marmalade, milk and coffee. For lunch, President Kennedy was particularly fond of soup--New England Fish Chowder was a favorite. He has been described as 
a "soup, sandwich and fruit" man for lunch--always soup though. For dinner there were no particular favorites, although he did like lamb chops, steak, baked 
chicken and turkey (white meat) and don't forget mashed potatoes. He also was fond of seafood and baked beans. According to chefs who worked in the White
 House, President Kennedy liked corn muffins too---so did Calvin Coolidge. For dessert, if he had it, it would likely be chocolate. President Kennedy was a small 
eater; he often had to be reminded that it was dinner time... politics always took preference over food."<br>

"A bowl of vichysoisse and chicken in champagne sauce are what President John F. Kennedy orders most often in New
York restaurants. Fred 
Decre of La Caravelle restaurant has prepared those dishes many times for Mr. Kennedy, who also asked the chef to 
pack them for two of his airplane trips during the recent campaign. Mr. Kennedy's taste in food is relatively sophisticated."<br>

<b>About Mrs. Kennedy's entertaining style</b><p>
"Not since the days of Dolley Madison had the White House been the scene for such brilliant entertaining as was done by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy and her
 history-conscious husband, John F. Kennedy - and not since the days of Thomas Jefferson, America's first gourmet of renown, had more serious thought been 
given to White House standards of food and drink....Mrs. Kennedy had a distinct preference for French cooking, and soon after moving into the White House, 
began looking for a chef to add the inimitable French touch.
She subsequently lured Rene Verdon, the French expert, away from the Carlyle Hotel in New York to preside over the White House kitchens. The French flavor 
he added to state dinners was an instant success."<br>

"Mrs. Kennedy...had tastes as cosmopolitan as my own...The President's tatse were somewhat heartier, when he was permitted to 
indulge them...Mr. Kennedy was very fond of the tiny quiches he had for his lunch...President Kennedy...did enjoy...cold beer. Mrs. Kennedy
favored the daiquiri."<br>

"Soup was a dish close to the heart of President Kennedy, since it gave him an opportunity to be served the fish for which his
New England background had given him a special appreciation. He dearly loved Boston clam chowder, and asked me to prepare it for
him on many occasions...I did everything I could to satisfy Mr. Kennedy's New England liking for good fish cookery. Quite naturally, as a
Catholic, he had it every Friday...I suspect the President also would have liked to have had another favorite, Boston 
baked beans, served to him in the White House, but as I have pointed out, the demands of a more formal cuisine would not
permit it."<br>
---<i>ibid</i> (p. 50-51)
<p>
"At the White House...the Kennedys were not especially fond of the more elaborate egg dishes. Mrs. Kennedy's customary
breakfast was orange juice, scrambled eggs, two strips of bacon, a little honey and a glass of skimmed milk. Occasionally she had
tea or coffee instead. Little John often had breakfast with her, and usually ate all her honey and bacon, but she did not seem to mind...
she was not in any case a large eater. The President's breakfast seldom varied. Nearly every day he had a large glass of
orange juice, toast with jam, two four-and-a-half minute eggs, some strips of broiled bacon and coffee with cream and sugar.
...Mr. Kennedy shared his wife's liking for souffles, especially at luncheon."<br>

"Nothing could be more unpretentious than the spectacle of the first family at luncheon on the occasional days when there was no

"Barbecue meals come in every size, shape and form...to come up with a menu that will never do you wrong, the eal I would choose is 
the one that President Johnson likes best...Texas Beef Barbecue with Natural Gravy, Smoked Ranch Beans, Cooked Country
Corn, Country Potato Salad, Texas Cole Slaw, Sliced Dill Pickle Spears, Spanish Sweet Onions, Modern Day Sourdough Biscuits,

"The typical morning meal prepared in the White House for president Jonson consisted of his favorite chipped beef covered with 
cream, and a cup of hot tea...Mrs. Johnson loved breakfast foods, including eggs and omelets, pancakes and waffles, even grits...
Mrs. Johnson can be credited with bringing back old-fashioned home-style cooking to the White House. She was a strong advocate
of serving home-baked bread...The family's affinity for plain biscuits led Mrs. Johnson to include Hot Biscuits on breakfast, lunch,
and dinner menus...President Johnson enjoyed snacking on Hot Biscuits stuffed with ham or his favorite deer sausage...
President Johnson liked his Texas-style dishes...President Johnson liked [Beef Stroganoff] along with other soft-textured meat
dishes such as...lamb hash, chicken chow mein, and chop suey...Seafood Creole..as one of President Johnson's favorites, as he really
loved seafood...Spinach was one of President Johnson's favorite vegetables. He especially enjoyed vegetable dishes prepared in 
unusual forms, such as light spinach souffle...President Johnson preferred his salad chopped so fine that he could eat it with
a spoon. He was a very rapid eater...This hard-working President was grateful for dishes he could eat quickly and still enjoy...
President Johnson was very fond of tapioca pudding...He preferred his pudding cold, served without any topping...Spanish Cream...
was a real favorite of President Johnson...As long as a dessert tasted sweet, President Johnson would eat it...Even though the 
American public seemed to believed that the Johnsons dined on Texas-style food on a daily basis, the family typically 
reserved tacos, chalupas, and nachos for dinner parties and special events. The Johnsons liked to share their own regional 
cooking with their guests...The Johnson administration was noted for barbecues, but it was the quality of the food served--
rather than the number of events conducted--which was the real reason for the reputation. In fact...they were the first
famiy to conduct a cookout at the White House...[President Johnson] was exceptionally enthusiastic about Eggplant 
Nicoise..."<br>
---<i>The White House Family Cookbook</i>, Henry Haller [Random House:New York] 1987 (p. 3-67)
<p>
"...with the Johnsons steak of all foods, reigns supreme. It is served for breakfast, for lunch, and for state dinners (though 
certainly not all in the same day)...Inf act, at the Presidential inaugual lunchoen, Texas heart of filet mignon was served...
the dinner before the big inaugural ball was a private one, in which bouillon, sirloin, spinach, potatoes, mixed green salad, and 
Baked Alaska were served...The President's food preferences seem to veer toward simple classics, well prepared by the family cook
of twenty-odd years, Mrs. Zephyr Wright...When a huge Texas steak isn't on the table, Southern fried chicken often is, along with
spoonbread, popovers, or other home-baked rolls. Mrs. Wright makes brownies frequently, but the President's very favorite dessert
is an old-fashioned homemade ice cream...Lady Bird favors simple dishes, and is partial to deer bacon, pickled okra, turkey
dressing, and spareribs. All the Johnsons are great milk consumers. After the blessing at the beginning of each meal, Mrs.
Johnson usually asks "Sweet milk or buttermilk?" and pours form the appropriate pitcher. It is almost a ritual. LBJ himself is a
buttermilk addict..."<br>

"No president except Jefferson relished a greater variety of flavors in cookery than Lyndon B. Johnson. He liked every style of
cooking, and there was a saying in the White House kitench that BJ 'will eat anything toat doesn't bite him first.' He was especially
partial to German food, Southern style cooking and French haute cuisine, but his greatest love was special Mexican foods. At receptions
at the White House, Lady Bird Johnson would sigh and shake her head as she saw her husband break his diet and reach into a bowl
of fiddle-faddle. He simply could not resist the combinations of nuts and popcorn held together by syrup...Only a person like 
Johnson could have got away with entertaining a visiting chief of state at a giant outdoor barbecue, as he did German Chancellor Ludwig
Erhard, and made it appear a perfectly natural thing to do...It as said around the White House that to LBJ, a week without chili in some form was
a week wasted."<br>

The Nixon family preferred modest American fare: fresh salads, California fruit, cottage cheese and yes, of course, 
<a href="presidents.html#nixonmeatloaf">THE meatloaf</a>.
It is possible these choices reflected Mr. Nixon's Quaker heritage.
<p>
"[Nixon] likes ketchup on his cottage cheese but his favorite food is meat loaf...His breakfast is served by Fina Sanchez, wife of Manolo, both
Castillians who came to New York via Cuba and live in the servants' quarters of the Nixon apartment. Nixon's breakfast fare is always
the same: Fresh orange juice, half a grapefruit, cold cereal and skim milk and coffee. Sometimes Mrs. Nixon...joins him for
coffee...The President-elect's working suite at the Pierre consists of a large drawing room, a bedroom, dressing room, bath, office
study and entrance foyer. The first thing Nixon does after depositing his coat in the closet is ring for a cup of coffee--his
second of the morning. He is not a chronic coffee drinker, a staff aide explained, but he does offer coffee to his visitors 
throughout the day and he, of course, drinks a cup with them. As he drinks his first cup at the office, he goes over the things
on his desk...He is never without a tape recorder within reach on which to record his thoughts and ideas on whatever subject
pops into his mind or comes up in a conversation...'The ideas he dictates into the machines and the memos are fantastic,' says
Rose Mary Woods, his long-time, loyal secretary...Nixon...is a weight-watcher but he does it unconsciously, says Miss 
Woods. His watching is most evident at lunch when he eats at when he eats at his desk. He has cottage cheese and fruit--it varies from 
day to day--peaches, pears or oranges--from the hotel's kitchen. Occasionally he deviates and has a hamburger and a cup of 
coffee. Once a week, he goes out for luncheon, usually with a long time personal friend and perhaps one or both of his
daughters. A favorite place for these occasions is the chic La Cote Basque Restaurant...Occaionally he works at his office
right through dinner. When he does, Manolo fixes him a late dinner at home from that Fina has left in the refrigerator or on the stove. More
often, he leaves the Pierre at 6:30 p.m. and enjoys the less-than-five-minute walk in the evening air to his apartment. Once there, he turns on the 
stereo and keeps music of all types--particularly show tunes he especialy likes--playing until he retires hours later. Sometimes
he goes to the den and mixes himself a drink, his first of the day. 'He drinks very infrequently,' a staff aide said...Nixon is 
ready for dinner by 7 p.m. and the famly dines by candlelight in the large formal dining room with soft music in the 
background. The menu is totaly unimportant to the President-elect. 'Dick eats everything but he likes meat loaf,' Mrs. Nixon said. 
Her meat loaf recipe calls for half beef and half pork. 'I have never seen him turn anything down. If he is particuarly pleased with what he
has, he'll call Fina and Manolo in to tell them how good it is.'"<br>

"A few weeks before their arrival, the Nixons sent advance men to the White House to discuss the new First Family's needs, likes and 
dislikes, and life-style...The new First Family liked simple American foods and ethnic dishes...The entire [Nixon] Family was partial to dishes made with fresh produce from California and Florida, including ripe avocadoes...
In the summer time, Mrs. Nixon liked a salad in which slices of the smooth-skinned Forida avocado were alternated with fresh 
grapefuit secions to make a light luncheon plate...Mrs. Nixon...was very conscious of her diet and chose to eat healthful
meals...During the humid Washington summers, the Nixons preferred luncheon menus built around cold foods. They enjoyed cold soups like
gazpacho, cold cucumber and other mousses, cold poached salmon, and especially cold seafood plates. With cold shrimp and crab, the 
Nixons liked a special red cocktail souce made with catsup...The Nixons were also fond of another seafood dish, the 
Mississippi Platter, which was made with fresh tuna or shrimp, lobster, and crab served on a bed of iceberg lettuce and garnished with
sliced hard-boiled eggs and tomatoes, radish roses, and crisp coleslaw...President Nixon liked to lunch on ...spicy Pepperoni 
Salad...president Nixon ate small portions, avoided snacking, and made up for immoderate eating at gourmet State Dinners with 
light menus for subsequent meals...President Nixon often requested a light luncheon tray served in his office. A cottage
cheese plate because his regular noontime meal, servie with Rye Crisp and sometimes fresh fruit in season...If the President
ever doused his cottage cheese with catsup, I never saw him, and doubt he ever did. Yet the rumoured "recipe" became rather popuar
with the dieting American Public...For breakfast, the President liked fresh fruit, wheat germ with nondairy creamer, and
coffee...The whole family liked light luncheons, often salads...Desserts were typically reserved for special family
occasions and meals attended by guests. Family dinner menus followed Mrs. Nixon's preferred pattern: meat or chicken, potato
or pasta, vegetables and/or salad, dessert by request. A first course was waived--except for the family's favored Baked Grapefruit and
occasionally a fresh fruit cup or clams on the half shell. Desserts, if any, consisted of fruits native to California and Florida. Dinner
was served promptly at 6:00P.M....One of the Nixons' favorite dinner meals was the boiled corned beef and cabbage dish...On the
evening of the President's inauguration, Mrs. Nixon phoned the Main Kitchen to order the First Family's first White House diner:
four steaks...and 'just a bowl of cottage cheese. The kitchen had been warned about the First Family's fondness for steak, so a selection
of prime cuts was already on hand. But no one had alerted the White House about the Nixons' penchant for cottage cheese...
An advernturous member of the kitchen crew volunteered to drive a White House limo around...in search of cottage cheese. Fortunately,
the mission was a success...Italian dishes were always a favorite on the Nixon's family dinner menus, with lasagna a close 
second to spaghetti. Since the Nixons liked beef, meatballs and/or meat sauce always adorned their pastas. Warm Italian bread, a 
green salad and a good red wine typically rounded out the meal...The Nixons also enjoyed other ethnic fare, including Chinese
and Mexican food...On the rare occasions when he did indulge, Preseident Nixon consumed his very favorite, very rich fooods, such
as Beef Stroganoff, Beef Wellington...Duckling a l'Orange...Homard a l'Americaine (lobster sauteed in oil and tomatoes...President Nixon loved the taste of macadamia
nuts..."<br>

<b>The Meatloaf</b>

"In the eyes of the American public, barbecued beef was supplanted by mundate meat loaf when the Nixons replaced the
Johnsons in the nation's First Home. Although the Presidents' personal tastes have often been exaggerated, President Nixon was 
quite fond of his wife's meat loaf, and meat loaf appeared about once a month on hte fmaily dinner menus. As soon as the

<b>Peking, 1972</b><br>
Several banquets celebrated Nixon's visit to China in 1972. Some were hosted by the Chinese
government; others by the American nationals. The <i>New York Times</i> published a general
description of the banquet given by Premier Cho En Lai for President Nixon on February 21,
1972. This article included a basic menu:
<p>
"Throughout an eight-course three-hour banquet in President Nixon's honor a band mingled
Chinese folk songs with such Americana as "Home on the Range,"...During the sumptuous
banquet in the Great Hall of the People, Premier Chou En-lai sat betwen Mr. and Mrs. Nixon at a
huge circular head table beneath enormous floodlit flags of the United States and the People's
Republic of China. A battalion of white-jacketed waiters served. The President seemed more
deft in manipulating the ivory chopsticks than he did in holding aloft the successive glasses of
crystal-clear, mao-tai, the sourghum-based Chinese liqueur...Each place there was a set of
chopsticks as well as a knife and fork, although most of the Americans used the chopsticks.
There was a constant rotation of dishes of blue and white in the traditional Chinese style. Each
person had something like two dozen pieces passed to him. The head table was the only one that
had 20 people at it--all the others had 10. The center was decorated with a field of grasses with
kumquats planted on them. The Menu: Hors d'oeurvres (including aged eggs, bacon and small
carp in vinegar sauce and other delicacies), Spongy bamboo shoots ad egg-white consomme,
Shark's fin in three shreds, Freid and stewed prawns, Mushroom and mustard greens, Steamed
chicken with coconut, Almond junket, Pastries, Fruits (north China tangerines)."<br>
---"Home on the Range Spices the Three Hour Banquet," <i>New York Times</i>, February 22, 1972 (p.
A15)
<p>
"You couldn't tell much from the terse menus at printed at the two banquets the Nixons have
attended this week in Peking. So, at first some peopel thought the Presidential party was getting
short shrift--simple dishes and too few courses....an American who has been at both state
dinners, Max Frankel, the New York Times Washington Bureau chief, has cleared up a great deal
of conclusion. During a telephone call yesterday from Peking, he reinforced the always logical
view that the foremost kitchen in China knows how to cook Chinese food. According to Mr.
Frankel, the food at both meals in the Great Hall of the People, was of consistently high quality
and many more dishes were served than were included on the official menus. Politically and
professionally impartial soruces in this country have also stressed that the much maligned first
banquet, hosted by Premier Chou En-lai, was a perfectly legitimate example of that rarified area
of Chinese gastronomy--classic cuisine. With few exceptions, the dishes the Nixons ate that first
night are never served in America. The banquet stressed purity and elegance of taste and,
particularly, texture. Shark's fin and almond junket are two examples of this, basically bland
foods, which, like th ancient eggs also served, delight the ultra-refined Chinese palate by their
feel and sublety rather than the pyrotechnics of their preparation. "The food is vastly more
interesting and delicate than the kind of mixture you tend to get in the United States"..."<br>

<b>President Nixon also liked ice cream!</b><br>
"President Nixon lived it up at one of Florida's best fish resturants, and he enjoyed himself so much that he stopped on the way home for an 
ice-cream sundae. The President, accompanied by confident Charles (Bebe) Rebozo and special counsel Charles Colson, dined on Florida stone crabs, pompano, craab-meat pate, 
asparagus, broccoli and baked potato shells at the Hasta, in Coral Gables, and washed down his dinner with a good French chablis. One the way home, he sent Rebozo out to an 
ice-cream store to get him a coconut-ice cream sundaae, topped with pineapple. While Rebozo was getting the sundae, the President stood beside his car, passing out
autographed cards and chatting with proprietor Paul Bleustein, who said he had voted for Mr. Nixon. 'Is business good?--it should be,' asked the President. 
'It's slow this year,' replied Bleusteikn. 'Your spririt has got to be up--up, up, up,' said the president."<br>

Down-home southern style family fare. Interesting and unpretentious. What better way to describe the Carter family table?
<p>
"When the Carters lived in the White House, the President usualky arose around 5:30A.M., sipping on some freshly squeezed juice
and hot coffee before heading for the Oval Office. After a few hours at his desk, President Carter was served a light breakfast, 
typically fresh fruit and buttered toast...[Amy and Mrs. Carter] liked to share fruit juice, scrambled or poached eggs, and toast.
Breakfast cereals were served alternately with the eggs, plus fresh fruit in season from time to time...One of the Carters'favorite
[Sunday] breakfast menus included Country-Style Ham with Redeye Gravy, scrambled eggs and baked grits, freshly baked Corn 
Bread and hot Fried Apples...For the most part, the Carters preferred simple, wholesome, down-home dishes. They were not "big
eaters," but they were not "picky" about their food either...In adujsting each menu plan to suit her family's schedule and personal
tastes, Mrs. Carter often took the time to describe a family favorite, so that the kitchen staff would prepare these dishes just
the way the Carters liked them. One of the Carters' favorite Southern-style side dishes was "red and white," or Red Beans and Rice...
...When they were first married, Jimmy Carter taught Rosalynn some of his favorite recipes. Mrs. Carter became an 
enthusiastic cook, and the young couple often prepared dishes together as a form or relaxation...The Carters liked homemade soups,
especially when served with sandwiches or warm homemade breads...Two of the family [sandwich] favorites included country ham
with cheddar cheese, and grilled cheddar with bacon and tomato. Amy's favorite sandwich was cold meat loaf on white bread, which she
often requested as part of her school lunch...Amy carried her lunch to school in a paper bag...[Amy's] favorite foods included
hamburgers and pizza, ice cream and cookies...Whether dinning alone or with family
and friends, the Carters preferred simple dinners that included lots of vegetables...They liked their vegetables served plain, raw
or lightly steamed. The Carters also enjoyed eating salads...President Carter was not partial to rich sauces, nor did he like most
commercial condiments...One of President Carter's favorite dishes was a chicken and vegetable stew...The Carters conintued to enjoy Southern-style
barbecues as White House residents...President Carter preferred serving spicy spare ribs...On Sunday nights, the entire White
House kitchen staff was off-duty. To cut some expenses and give the staff a break the Carters prepared their own supper 
that night, typically an informal meal consisting mainly of leftovers, usually sandwiches. President Carter was fond of 
Pork chops with corn bread stuffing...Plain chicken dishes turned out to be some of the Carters' favorite menu selections for
family dinners. President Carter was especially fond of baked chicken breasts stuffed with cheddar cheese, and fried chicken made
"Southern-style"....Butternut squash, zucchini, butter beans, vine-ripe tomatoes, and fries corn were some of President Carter's
favorite vegetables. He also liked greens such as collards and kale, and he even enjoyed a number of dishes made with okra...But
eggplant was undoubtedly Jimmy Carter's favorite vegetable. The President liked fresh eggplant straight out of the garden, thinly
sliced and batter-fried, or baked in a souffle or casserole...Peanuts were the Carters' family symbol long before they became White
House residents. They enjoyed eating peanuts, plain or as an ingredient...but no more than the typical family."<br>

<p>
<b>The Grits Factor</b><br>
"Even before they had settled into the White House, reports in the press began to highlight the Carters' Southern style of 
life. The public was forewarned that the White House would soon serve grits to guests...For the Carters' first breakfast in the White House, grits were included on the menu. A staple dish for the Carters and their
 Southern visitors, grits soon became standard fare for White House guests from all over the world. The White House kitchen had 
quickly realized that many of the Carters' distinguished visitor really expected to be served grits, and most were pleasantly
surprised to discover they actually liked the taste of the ground hominy dish...President Carter liked grits baked with cheese, so the dish was
often included on the family's weekend breakfast menu."<br>

3. In a smaller mixing bowl, beat egg with warm milk, using a wire whisk. Stir in melted butter.<br>
4. Pour over dry ingredients and mix with the wire whisk until smooth. Let stand for 15 minutes. (It is important to let batter rest
before baking so that the cornmeal absorbs the liquid and the resulting texture is smooth, never grainy.)<br>
5. Scrape batter into the prepared pan. Bake on lower shelf of preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until top is golden and toothpick

"The Reagans typically eat breakfast together at 7:45 A.M., and their menu is as consistent as it is sensible. The nutrition-conscous First lady is aware
of the importance of including adequate amounts of fiber-rich foods in the diet, and of minimizing intake of fat and cholesterol.
Therefore, the Reagans start the day with bran cereal, skim milk, fresh fruit, and decaffeinated coffee. Once a week, eggs are
served--scrambled, poached, or soft-boiled for our minutes--a single egg for each of them. The President usually supplements his
morning repast with whole wheat toast or a home-made muffin...Monkey Bread is a heavy, sweet loaf that serves as a Reagain family 
tradition...Reserved for special occasions and holidays, Monkey Bread is a definate deviation from the lighter fare preferred by
the First Lady...When bread is included on the Reagan family dinner menus, it is most often in the form of wedges of pita...
Ronald Reagan...retained an appetite for simple, home-style meals. Even in the White House, Ronald Reagan prefers the plain
foods of his early days...These include such homey dishes as Macaroni and Cheese, Meat Loaf, and Hamburger Soup...The President
usually has lunch in the Oval Office, and he prefers a light meal such as soup, bread, and a fruit dessert. He likes
minestrone with a wedge of fresh Italian bread, lentil soup with sliced frankfurters, navy bean or black beans soup, and Scotch broth
made with barley. His favorite soup...is a home-style hanburger soup made with beef broth, lean ground beef, fresh tomatoes, and
hominy. Served with a slice of toasted French bread and perhaps a medly of fresh fruit for dessert...Sunday night fare typically 
consists of a simple main dish, fresh vegetables, salad and fruit. The Reagans are fond of hash made with chicken, but the 
President's favorite is an old-fashioned roast beef hash. Sometimes they enjoy a hearty dinner of roast beef with Yorkshire Pudding.
They are also fans of a California favorite, steak with chili. Mrs. Reagan likes her meat cooked medium-well, while the
President prefers his well-done...Dinner menus at Rancho del Ciero are similar to the hearty meals served at Camp David...Although
the reagans prefer chicken, veal, and fish to beef, several of their best-liked dishes do feature lean beef. Beef and Kidney Pie is one...
...Osso Bucco...is a favorite of the Reagans and is served for both family dinners and special meals. Other veal dishes favored
by the Reagans include veal scallopine in Marsala, Veal Piccata, and Veal Parmigiana...President Reagan is especially fond of 
broiled swordfish napped with lemon butter. Mrs. Reagan is fond of number of fish dishes, including salmon mousse, grilled
halibut steak, broiled trout with kiwi fruit, and swordfish Veronique...the Reagans ...enjoy some sort of light dessert after
most every meal. Fruit desserts are especially popular, including a wide array of apple dishes...The President is fond of honey-baked
apples, and Mrs. Reagan's favorite is an old-fashioned Apple Brown Betty..."

<font color="#003366" size=+1>George Herbert Walker Bush</font><p>
Some Presidents are famous for enjoying fine food; others are noted for preferring "down home" simple fare. 
Mr. George Herbert Walker Bush is probably the only President best known for disliking a particular food. That would be 
broccoli. 
<p>
"George Bush, still harboring a childhood grudge against broccoli, escalated the rhetoric today in his one-man war against the vegetable.
"I do not like broccoli and I haven't liked it since I was a little kid and my mother made me eat it and I'm President of the United States and I'm not going to eat any more broccoli," Bush proclaimed to cheers and laughter at the close of an outdoor news conference.
Bush's forthright stand has brought howls from broccoli growers, who are shipping 10 tons of the green, flowery vegetable from California to the nation's capital to feed the hungry.
"Now, look. This is the last statement I'm going to have on broccoli," Bush said. "There are truckloads of broccoli at this very minute descending on Washington. My family is divided."
But the President admitted that at least one member of the Bush family likes broccoli.
"For the broccoli vote out there: Barbara loves broccoli. She has tried to make me eat it. She eats it all the time herself," Bush said. "So she can go out and meet the
 caravan of broccoli that's coming in."<br>
---"Bush's Broccoli Hatred Flowers Into Presidential Proclamation," <i>Los Angeles Times</i>,  Mar 22, 1990, (p. 2)
<p>
""Broccoli every day." That was my mother's slogan, and we got it every day, like oatmeal and soft-boiled eggs. But in those days broccoli came packed in mud-or 
so it seemed-and you got grains of dirt with every bit no matter how many rinses or how much hosing they got. No wonder President George Bush hates broccoli. 
If I were the President of the United States, I probably would too, remembering only the bad old days."<br>
---"Broccoli Tops the Favorite Vegetable List, Hands Down Nutrition: Despite what the President might think, there are several delicious ways to 
prepare broccoli so that it tempts even the most stubborn of taste buds," ROSE DOSTI, <i> Los Angeles Times</i>,Mar 29, 1990 (p. 37)

<p>
<b>What about other vegetables?</b><br>

"Vice President George Bush won't eat cauliflower. Or Brussels sprouts.
Barbara Pierce Bush, the vice president's wife of 41 years, revealed these tidbits from "the life of the wife of the vice president" at a breakfast in Irvine on Monday for 500 Republicans.
The vice president's dislike for vegetables came up as Mrs. Bush spoke of the 145 or so letters she receives each week and then entertained the crowd by reading a sample of her favorites.
"Dear Mrs. Bush, would you please send me the vice president's favorite recipes? Never mind the vegetables," one fan wrote.
"They obviously knew George Bush," Mrs. Bush said. "The day he was 60, he said to me: `I am never going to eat broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower or 
cabbage again.' And he hasn't!"<br>
---"Or a Vegetarian Second Lady's Role Not for a Bush-Leaguer," LANIE JONES, <i> Los Angeles Times</i>,  May 6, 1986 (p. 1)

<p>
"A debate is under way among close associates of George Bush over the favorite snack of the President. Mr. Bush has long shown a fondness for pork rinds, so
 much so that Congressional leaders recently brought him some as a good-will gift. But some longtime Bush friends, such as Don Rhodes and Vic Gold, insist that 
his true love is popcorn.."<br>

<p>
"Ten years ago the recently inaugurated George Bush was making his favorite foods known. For a black-tie $1,500-a-plate inaugural dinner what did he choose? A baked bean and scrod dinner to commemorate the great state of his birth, Massachusetts? Oysters a la Connecticut to note the days of his youth? A messy Texas barbecue from his adopted home state? Or, from his Kennebunkport summer home, Maine lobsters?
Instead George and Barbara Bush for the first of many presidential dinners designed a meal around the taste buds of George Washington and called it "From 
George to George." Here are two recipes from that feast.<p>
<b>Corn Pudding</b><br>

4 strips bacon, cut into small pieces<br>
3/4 cup onions, chopped<br>
1 sweet bell pepper, diced<br>
1 cup milk<br>
1 cup heavy (whipping) cream<br>
2 tablespoons butter<br>

1 cup white corn kernels<br>
2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons flour<br>
1/2 teaspoon thyme<br>
1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley<br>
Salt and white pepper to taste<br>
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.<br>
In a frying pan, cook the bacon until crisp. Remove the bacon and set aside. Add the onions to the pan and saute them until transparent. Add the bell pepper and cook for 3 minutes. Set aside.
Heat the milk and cream over low heat until warm. Add the butter and heat until the butter melts. Remove from the heat and slowly add the milk mixture to the beaten eggs, whisking lightly to combine. Add the corn, flour, thyme, parsley, cooked bacon, onions and peppers and salt and pepper to taste. Stir to combine.
Pour the mixture into an ungreased 1 1/2-quart oval baking dish and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes until golden brown..."
<p>
<b>Apple-Cranberry Brown Betty</b><br>
(10 servings)<br>
This is good with a little cinnamon or vanilla ice cream on the side.<br>
Butter and sugar for preparing the souffle dish<br>
10 Granny Smith apples<br>
1 teaspoon lemon juice<br>
6 tablespoons butter, plus additional 1/2 cup melted<br>
3 tablespoons sugar<br>
2 cups fresh cranberries, washed and dried<br>
1 cup golden raisins, soaked in warm water for 15 minutes then squeezed dry<br>
Zest of 2 oranges<br>
1 cup light brown sugar<br>
1/4 teaspoon mace<br>
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br>
3 cups stale white-bread crumbs, crusts removed>br?
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Butter a 2-quart straight-sided glass souffle dish and then sprinkle with sugar.
Peel, core and quarter the apples, then cut each quarter into 3 chunks. Reserve in a bowl. Sprinkle the lemon juice over the apples and toss to combine.
In a large frying pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the butter until hot and add 1/3 of the apple pieces. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of the sugar and saute over high heat until the apples are lightly caramelized. Remove the apples from heat and reserve in a large bowl. Repeat process until all the apples are cooked. Combine the apples with the cranberries, raisins, orange zest, brown sugar, mace and cinnamon and mix well.
Mix the bread crumbs with the remaining 1/2 cup melted butter. Line bottom of souffle bowl with 1/3 of the bread-crumb mixture. Add 1/2 of the apple-cranberry mixture, then sprinkle with 1/3 more of the bread crumbs. Add rest of apple-cranberry mixture, then top with the remaining bread crumbs.

"Bill Clinton's favorite foods include chicken enchiladas, tacos, barbecued ribs, cheeseburgers, lemon chess pie, peach pie, beef tenders marinated in Italian dressing and 
hims mom's sweet-potato casserole..."<br>
---"Bill and His Diet," <i>New York Times</i>, January 17, 1993 (p. SM50)
<p>
"THE good news is, my husband loves to eat and enjoys it," Hillary Clinton said. "The bad news is, he loves to eat, even when things are not always right for him." 
Visits to nine restaurants here that his friends say are among Bill Clinton's favorites, as well as sightings around the country, confirm his wife's description of his 
eating habits. From Sims Bar-B-Q to Juanita's, from Doe's Eat Place to Hungry's Cafe, President-elect Clinton prefers the stuff with fat in it: jalapeno 
cheeseburgers, chicken enchiladas, barbecue, cinnamon rolls and pies. But no chocolate-chip cookies...
Mr. Clinton must get his calories in other forms because he is allergic to chocolate and to milk...
The President-elect's taste in food reflects the kind of diet most people his age and older grew up eating: heavy on the meat, dessert at every meal and tiny amounts 
of vegetables, the tinier the better. 
This information may send current and future White House chefs into paroxysms of fear. But they need not worry. Anyone capable of making a good hollandaise 
should have no trouble with an enchilada. And no one in the White House will have to bother with barbecue; Sims will gladly deliver. 
Mr. Clinton's battle of the bulge is one most people can sympathize with, especially if they have to eat irregular meals on the road. By the time of the New York 
primary in April, Mr. Clinton weighed more than 200 pounds, a gain of about 30 pounds... 
"Bill's partial to chicken enchiladas," Mr. Abernathy said. "We're somewhat famous for them." He described them in loving detail: "They're made with Smooth 
Melt Cheese, which is similar to Velveeta but not cheese food. It's real cheese."...
Mr. Clinton is also partial to soft tacos and to Clausthaler, a nonalcoholic German beer. He drinks very little alcohol, friends and restaurateurs say, preferring a soft 
drink or iced tea. 
Now that the President-elect causes traffic to stop whenever he goes out, he's been eating a lot of carryout, from Juanita's and elsewhere.
 Often it includes chili con queso made with three kinds of cheese and three kinds of peppers, a dip Mr. Abernathy says is addictive. 
Sims Bar-B-Q, in a rundown little shack that draws a cross-section of Little Rock's people, has been run by the Sims-Settlers family for 60 years, and the family 
members certainly know how to smoke meats. 
Mr. Clinton is partial to sliced pork barbecue, baked beans and slaw, sliced beef, potato salad and sweet potato pie....To pay a bet he lost on an Arkansas-Georgia football game, Mr. Clinton sent some of Sims's barbecued chicken this fall to Gov. Zell Miller of Georgia. 
All those visits Mr. Clinton has made to McDonald's notwithstanding, the President-elect doesn't eat there much. 
At least not anymore. In a "Saturday Night Live" skit a few weeks ago Phil Hartman, the actor impersonating Mr. Clinton, was seen in a McDonald's with his 
Secret Service agents, one of whom said to him, "Mrs. Clinton told us not to let you into any fast-food places." Despite the warning, he snatched food from people's
 plates as he talked to them. 
In fact, all the President-elect gets at McDonald's these days is a glass of water and a cup of coffee. 
"When he's not on a diet," one of the counter people said, "he has an Egg McMuffin." 
Once or twice a week, when he was Governor, his jogging took him by the Community Bakery, where he would get a cup of coffee and a bagel, plain or cinnamon. 
No sweets for Mr. Clinton? "A lot of times he'd get cake doughnuts," said John Sproles, the manager, "but I don't know if he ate them." 
Ann Ward, owner of Hungry's Cafe, seemed far more knowledgeable -- or forthcoming. "He'd stop twice a week when the Legislature was in session," said Ms. 
Ward, whose restaurant serves a lunch of "one meat, two veg., bread, tea, Kool-Aid or coffee" for $4.50. One meat means hamburger pepper loaf, smothered 
steak, fried chicken or chicken fried steak. 
The restaurant looks the way any place called Hungry's should look: a stamped-tin ceiling, dark green walls with chipped paint, linoleum on the floor worn by thousands of scraping chairs and footsteps, and a different oilcloth pattern on every table. 
"Mr. Clinton often had cinnamon rolls," Ms. Ward said, rolls nearly as big as hubcaps. In a bow to his cholesterol count, he smeared them with margarine, she added. 
None of Mr. Clinton's favorite restaurants ever gained the fame reserved for Doe's Eat Place, where Mr. Clinton often held important political events. Decorated in Early Attic, it exudes legend. Ersatz legend. The place is only four years old. Some of the patina that has rubbed off on it is from its namesake in Greenville, Miss., which is legendary: it opened 50 years ago. The Little Rock Doe's pays a fee to the Greenville restaurant to use the name. 
Tim Jones, a waiter at Doe's, calls it "vegetarian hell." 
"We have potato and one kind of salad," he said, "but most people come here for a greasy cheeseburger or a two-pound steak." Mr. Clinton has had his share of 
both...
The restaurant's cook, Lucille Robinson, has been feeding Mr. Clinton for 15 years, starting at a place called the Band Box, whose owner, George Eldridge, also owns Doe's. Mr. Eldridge plans to open a place similar to Doe's in Washington under the name George & Lucille's. 
"The Governor always eats jalapeno cheeseburgers, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, pickles and onions," Ms. Robinson said. "But last time he was in he had tamales and French fries. He has to cut back every now and then." <br>

<b>Notes from the Governor's Mansion in Little Rock, Arkansas confirms Mr. Clinton appreciated quick access to portable food.  This is not exactly the same thing as "fast food."</b><p>
"Some of Governor Clinton's favorite foods were corn pudding, fried chicken, roast beer and carrot cake...I can't remember Governor Clinton ever sitting down to eat a
normal meal during the time he was governor. He would walk through the kitchen, get...some kind of sandwich, and go to his office to work. He loved roast beef
sandwiches."<br>

"Because food wasn't much of a priority for the Bushes, whenever a dish met with Mrs. Bush's approval, the inclination among her
staff was to have it served as often as possible. There's no better example of this than a fresh pea soup with mint we served one
day...President and Mrs. Bush didn't eat only Tex-Mex food...One of their favorite things was warm biscuits...They also appreciated a
rich, homemade chicken pot pie...For all the differences between them, Mrs. Bush seemed to quite enjoy the repertoire of lunch dishes
...created for Mrs. Clinton--the healthful salads, soups, wraps...Like Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Bush enjoyed a one-course lunch, relatively low in protein
and fat...Of course, there was tweaking to do. Mrs. Bush loved beets...She favored spicier food over mild food, so we livened
up the dishes with chiles and hot sauces whenever it made sense. And, of course, she liked to be served Tex-Mex and Southwester
food as often as possible...There was a handful of things that the President wanted for lunch, and her almost never deviated from
that list. There was a BLT...He liked his grilled cheese sandwiches made with Kraft Singles and white bread...He also enjoyed peanut
butter and honey sandwiches, and occasionally a burger, cooked between medium and medium rare, on a bun with lettuce and tomato on 
the side...There was one more thing the President insisted on: he wanted his food to be prompt. President Bush does not like to be
kept waiting, and is legendary for this...Not only did the President like to start right away, but he liked to finish his meals
quickly as well...On most Sundays, if the Bushes weren't at Camp David...the President wanted the same thing for lunch: A
post-church meal of huevos rancheros...Another popular weekend snack for the President, according to Mrs. Bush herself, was deviled
eggs..."<br>

<b>What does our 44th president like to eat? We're just beginning to find out!</b>
<p>
"Every president has his favorite stuff. And it doesn't take long for the nation to become enamored with a president's pet things and habits, particularly a celebrity president such as Barack Obama. 
With Ronald Reagan, it was jelly beans. Jimmy Carter munched peanuts. And George W. Bush is a pretzel lover. The election of Obama will bring a new cadre of often-upscale brand names to the White House. 
For marketers, it's the chance of a lifetime. Among the brands Obama has worn, sipped, eaten or driven in public: Hart Schaffner Marx suits, Black Forest Berry 
Honest Tea, Fran's Chocolates, Planters Trail Mix and the Ford Escape hybrid SUV. 
He also drinks lots of bottled water...
Key Obama family brands:...
*Snacks. Obama tries to snack healthy. He likes Planters Trail Mix: Nuts, Seeds and Raisins. Planters has White House links dating to former president 
(and peanut farmer) Carter, as a sponsor of the Plains, Ga., Peanut Festival, says Laurie Guzzinati, a Kraft Foods spokeswoman. 
For sweets, the Obamas eat Fran's Chocolates, an artisan chocolate brand from Seattle. The president-elect prefers Fran's Smoked Sea Salt Caramel in Milk 
Chocolate ($24 for a 16-piece box); wife Michelle prefers dark chocolate, says Sean Seedlock, Fran's marketing chief. 
*Drinks. Obama is a fan of Black Forest Berry Honest Tea. "It raises the profile of our brand and all organic products," says Seth Goldman, CEO of Honest Tea.
 "We'd love for it to be the official drink of the new administration.""<br>
---"Obama family favorites likely to get brand boost," Bruce Horovitz, <i> USA TODAY</i> Nov 6, 2008 (p. B4)
<p>
"We believe that a candidate's taste in food is a more reliable indicator of character than the carefully strained statements issued in this atmosphere of gotcha and 
gotcha back. So we have worked our sources and come up with the names of the candidates' favorite restaurants in their home states...The Obamas' favorite spot for a night out in Chicago is the alta cocina Mexican restaurant Topolobampo, said Michelle Obama spokeswoman Katie McCormick Lelyveld. 
Chicagoans know Topolobampo as the quieter, slightly classier sister restaurant of Frontera Grill, both owned by award-winning chef Rick Bayless. Sun-Times restaurant critic Pat Bruno has praised its "creativity and quality."
For a simpler bite, the Obamas turn to RJ Grunts, a cartoony Lincoln Park emporium of burgers, ribs and Tex-Mex standards, the spokeswoman says. On her 
own, Michelle Obama has favored the more cutting-edge food at Sepia in the West Loop neighborhood...Obama's idea of a fast meal is to order from a scruffy
 minimall pizza place near his South Side house called Italian Fiesta Pizzeria...Much more interesting on the Obamas' dining list is Topolobampo, Rick Bayless' superb little shrine to the full panoply of Mexico's cuisine. We have eaten there 
happily for years, enjoying its authentic, even scholarly versions of classic dishes such as chilaquiles and Yucatecan roast pork. Topolobampo is one of the reasons we think Chicago is arguably America's top eating city, with fewer high-end addresses than New York but a more stellar, dramatic pantheon.
From its diverse and creative menu, Topolobampo says, Obama often orders sopa azteca, a dark broth flavored with pasilla chilies, grilled chicken, avocado, 
Meadow Valley Farm handmade Jack cheese, thick cream and tortilla strips."<br>
