The history of meal times (and number of meals consumed) makes for fascinating study. These
differ greatly from culture to culture and through time. They also depend upon the
socio-economic class of the person who was eating. If you are studying the meal times of a
specific place/people/period please let us know. <a href="foodfaq7.html#americanmealtimes">American meal times</a> were introduced
by Old World settlers and evolved independently accordingly to fit cultural norms. General overview:

<p>
<b>Ancient Greek meal times</b><br>
"Meal times are variable, but a midday meal was usually called <i>ariston</i>  lunch... and an
evening meal <i>deipnon</i>,  dinner. The latter was perhaps typically the biggest meal of the
day, and for some the only meal."<br>
---<i>Siren Feasts: A History of Food and Gastronomy in Greece</i>, Andrew Dalby
[Routledge:London] 1996 (p. 12)
<p>
<b>British meal times</b> (overview)<br>
"In the beginning of the sixteenth century in England, dinner, the main meal of the day, used to
begin at 11:00AM.
Meals tended over time to be eaten later and later in the day: by the eighteenth century, dinner
was eaten at about
3:00PM...By the early nineteenth century, lunch, what Palmer in <i>Moveable Feasts</i> calls "the
furtive snack," had become
a sit-down meal at the dning table in the middle of the day. Upper-class people were eating
breakfast earlier, and dinner
later, than they had formerly done...in 1808...dinner was now a late meal and supper a snack taken
at the very end of the
day before people retired to bed. For a long time luncheon was a very upper-class habit; ordinarily
working people dined
in the early evening, and contented themselves as they had done for centuries with a mid-day
snack...Supper now means
a light evening meal that replaces dinner; such a meal is especially popular if people have eaten a
heavy lunch..."<br>
---<i>The Rituals of Dinner</i>, Margaret Visser [Penguid:New York] 1991 (p. 159-160)
<p>
<b>Anglo-Saxon period</b><br>
"Taking meals at regular times was seen a good thing in moral terms:  every mouth needs food;
meals shall take place at their proper time'...Gluttony consisted of eating before the time of the
meal, as well as taking too much. Regular mealtimes seem to have been seen as evidence of an
ordered, civilised life. Morever, in large establishments, serving meals at set hours would have
saved time. Punctual meals were particularly important in monasteries where the offices had to be
observed. When meals were taken, or even how many meals a day there were, varied according to
the calendar, social class, and personal preference. The novice of the Colloquy seems to eat first
soon after midday...The <i>Regularis Concordia</i> mentions the <i>prandium ad sextam</i> at
noon, and a <i>cena</i> between Vespers and Compline allowed daily from Easter until Whitsun.
From Whitsun until September 14 (apart from certain fast days which included Wednesdays and
Fridays) and on all Sundays and feasts of twelve lessons there were also two meals a day but the
<i>prandium</i> was not taken until none (3 p.m.). A single meal <i>ad noman</i> between
Nones and Vespers was the rule for the winter period from September 14 to Lent; in Lent and on
Quarter Tense days the one meal was <i>ad vesperam</i> (after Vespers). So it appears there
was a main, midday meal, though this might be put back to mid-afternoon, or later, for which the
term was <i>ge-reordung</i> or <i>non-mete</i>. According to the Old English <i>Rule of
Chodegang</i>, if <i>preostas</i> ate twice a day then it was a midday and evening, and at
Aethelwold's monastery the monks had dinner and supper...An ealier meal than dinner or supper
is referred to--the <i>undernswoesendum</I>. <i>Undern</i> was roughly the period of
dawn...In contrast to the monastic regimen where the main meal was at or around midday, it is
possible that in a secular time-table, main meals were at the third hour and again at supper time, to
allow a full day's activity between them. A number of individuals, usually for religious reasons,
chose to have only one meal a day. There may have been others whose meals were similarly
limited from lack of resources, but we do not hear of them."<br>
---<i>A Handbook of Anglo-Saxon Food: Processing and Consumption</i>, Ann Hagen [Anglo
Saxon Books:1992] (p. 69-70)
<p>
<b>Medieval era</b><br>
"...what were the mealtimes and how often did people eat a day? The very poor doubtless ate
when they could, but the slightly better-off peasants seem generally to have eaten three times a
day. These meals consisted of breakfast at a very early hour to allow for dinner at about 9 a.m., or
not later than 10.00 a.m., and supper probably before it got dark, perhas at 3.00 p.m. in the
winter. The times and number of meals were originally derived from the hours of devotions of the
Church. Monks ate the main meal of their day after the celebration of nones, which was nine hours
after daybreak. This was in practice at some time between midday and 3.00 p.m. The evening
meal had to be a reasonable time after this, at or after vespers (around sunset). Three meals a day
were accepted as reasonable by most later sixteenth-century writers, such as Andrew Borde,
although he thought that this was only good for the labouring man: anyone else should be content
with two. It has been suggested that breakfast was only eaten by children and workmen, but
certainly by the fifteenth century it was quite commonly taken by everyone....although the 1478
household ordinance of Edward IV specified that only residents down to the rank of squires
should have breakfast, except by special order...The time was only specified as  a 'convenyent
hower', although to break one's fast after devotions was the generally recommended procedure.
Earlier reference to breakfast sometimes meant dinner, literally, in these cases, the first meal of the
day. Sir William Harrison thought that in previous times (not specified) there had been four meals
eaten a day, that is breakfast, dinner,  nuntions (or  'nuncheons', taken about noon) and late
supper. Nuncheons was usually something eaten by workmen who were given payment for
it...Edward Prince of Wales (son of Edward IV) probably dined at 11.00 a.m....and supped at
5.00 p.m....The staggering of meals in large households, with the servants eating earlier than the
lord...was common."<br>
---<i>Food and Feast in Medieval England</i>, P.W. Hammond [Wrens Park Publishing:Pheonix
Mill] 1993 (p. 104-5)
<p>
<b>Renaissance period</b><br>
"...what time to eat? Should the midday meal or evening meal be larger? Entire books were
composed on this very topic. Medieval theorists, and common custom through the Renaissance,
favored the "prandium," or dinner, at ten or eleven in the morning, as the larger meal. Digestion,
it was thought, is fortified by movement and the heat of the sun...authors, armed with a purified
Galen and other Greek authors, promoted the larger "coena," or supper, at around six in the
evening. They argued that distribution of humors and spirits, the third stage of digestion, is
stronger during the day, but concoction is much stronger when the mind and body are at
rest...Most authors agreed that two meals are sufficient, although some Arabists favored three
meals in two days or food every sixteen hours. The English vehemently defended their custom of
taking breakfast. Most agreed in condemning the between-meal and late-night snacks, or
"merenda" and "collations." The latter term originally referred to the light monastic meal at the
end of the day, which derives its name from John Cassian's "Collations," which was read during
the meal. It eventally came to mean all late-night nibbles or after-dinner dainties...Digestions, it
must be remembered, was thought to proceed in distinct separate stages rather than one long
continual process along the digestive tract. Thus, knowing how long each stage requires also
reveals the ideal time to eat. A meal must not commence until the former meal has been
thoroughly processed...Such a schedule would mean rising at 6:00, dining from 10:00 to 11:00,
supping from 6:00 to 7:00, and sleeping at 11:00."<br>
---<i>Eating Right in the Renaissance</I>, Ken Albala [University of California Press:Berkeley]
2002 (p. 112-3)
<p>
<b>Early modern Europe</b><br>
"One detail that comes primarily from literary evidence is the time of day when meals were
customarily taken. This was acutally a matter of debate among dietary writers in the sixteenth
century, but most of the deferred to the authority of ancient authors like Galen and recommended
two meals per day. The first smaller meal, dinner, should be taken at around 11:00 a.m., and a
larger meal, supper, follows six hours later at around 5:00 or 6:00 p.m. These authors reasoned
that since the digestive powers are stronger during sleep when the digestive heat is withdrawn
inward, and because there are more hours between the evening and morning meal, that supper
should be larger. These recommendations follow ancient practice, and concide with early modern
custom in Spain and some parts of Italy like Venice and Genoa. But the rest of Europe followed a
different pattern--eating the larger meal in the late morning and smaller meal in the evening. The
evidence for this comes foremost from literary descriptions of meals that usually take place
mid-day. Even in the vast majority of cookbooks that offer menus, the grander meal was held at
mid-day...What is clear is that meal times gradually shifted, dinner being held later and later in the
day.
In the sixteenth century dinner was held around 11:00 a.m. By the seventeenth century it had
crept to 12:00 or 1:00 p.m. Samuel Pepys, the seventeenth-century English diarist, recorded
several dinners he ate at 12:00 replete with heavy drinking. In the eighteenth century fashionable
dinners, and the gentry and business classes in the cities who sought to imitate them, ate dinner
later and later in the afternoon...Actually the usual dinner time was 2:00 or 3:00 p.m. by
mid-century and by the late eighteenth century it was perhaps as late as 4:00 or 5:00 p.m. Only in
more recent times has it come to rest in the evening, when supper consequently became less
important. This development necessitated the invention of a new mid-day meal, lunch, which only
became standard at the very end of the eighteenth century. Even more elusive is evidence for
breakfast. Judging from cookbooks and dietary literature there was no such meal, or at least it
was only recommended to children, invalids and the elderly who have weak digestive systems and
must eat smaller meals more frequently. Nevertheless, there was such a meal, and some people
took it regularly...What appears to have happened is that as dinner moved later in the day, people
were hungrier first thing in the morning, especially when the evening meal was relatively small. In
countries where the evening meal was larger, breakfast did not become important. In southern
Europe it is still not a proper meal, but merely coffee and perhaps a piece of bread or pastry. In
England and the north the pattern was quite different...By the eighteenth century breakfast...was
eaten around 9:00 or 10:00 in the morning. Only in the nineteenth century did it emerge as a full
and sumptuous meal with bacon, eggs and even steaks. Thus the three-meal-a-day pattern we are
familiar with is a relatively recent phenomenon. The English afternoon meal called "tea" as a
snack between lunch and dinner also did not emerge until the nineteenth century...This kind of
evidence of course only relates to the meal patterns of the upper classes. From the comments of
dietary writers who usually disapproved of common custom, it is certain that laboring people ate
many more meals, usually a breakfast, dinner in the mid-morning, some form of snack at sundown
and then a small supper late in the evening. This pattern also persisted despite the shift in meal
times among elites."<br>

<b>Anglo-Indian meal times</b><br>
"Early European officials in India laid lavish tables. Mandeloslo in 1638 notes '15 or 16 dishes of meat, besidest he dessert' in the home of the president of the 
English merchants at Surat who all lived together. Even in 1780 in Calcutta, Mrs. Eliza Fay, a lwayer's wife and herself a dressmaker, wrote: 'We dine at 2 O'clock
 in the very heat of the day...A soup, a roast fowl, curry and rice, a mutton pie, forequarter of lamb, a rice pudding, tarts, a very good cheese, fresh churned butter, 
excellent Madeira...'...Edward Lear, known to posterity for his limericks, had a breakfast while in India in 1874 of 'boiled prawns, prawn urry, cold mutton, bread
 and butter, and plantains. A painting of an English family at breakfast shows fried fish, rice, oranges and a baked casserole of some sort...In the 18th century the 
main meal, exemplified by the huge spread desecribed by Mrs. Fay, was in the middle of the day, followed by a siesta, evening visits and light dinner at night...
About 1910, a suggested lunch consisted of pea soup, roast chicken and tongue, bread sauce, potatoes, cheese macaroni and lemon pudding. The main meal had 
moved to 7 or 8 in the evening, and in 1909 the writer Maud Divers declares that 'India is the land of dinners, as England is the land of five-o'clock teas...'"<br>

<b>American meal times</b><br>
"American meal patterns over the past four centuries have varied across different regions of the
country and have been determined by an individual's occupation, social class, gender, ethnicity,
and personal preferences. Seasons, holidays, and the weekly round of activities also played a part
in determining what is eaten when. All meals, whether served at home or in a restaurant, are
structured events...In colonial times, American meal patterns followed European
practices, in which the extended family participated in meals, which occurred three times a day;
the standard meals were breakfast, dinner, and supper. As the first meal of the day, breakfast...was
eaten immediately upon rising or a few hours later, after the earliest chores have been
completed...Working men and schoolchildren returned home for dinner, the main meal of the day,
which was traditionally served in the early or late afternoon...Supper, the last meal of the day, was
light and, sometimes, optional. It was eaten in the early evening...The traditional meal pattern
began to change duirng the mid-nineteenth century, due in part to the growth of cities and the
shifting of occupations of American men. The first meal to change was dinner. As towns and cities
grew, it became more difficult for wokers to return home for dinner at midday as the distance
between home and the place of work increased...Dinner, the most important meal of the day,
moved to the evenings, when the family could dine together at a more leisurely pace. The midday
repast came to be called lunch...and evolved into a small, light, and frequently rushed meal--often
something brought from home in a tin pail or a brown bag, or a quick bite in a workplace
cafeteria. Sandwiches, soups, and salads became common luncheon foods...After World War II,
the American meal pattern changed yet again...Snacking became increasingly common as the
century progressed, and the "three squares" diminished in importance."<br>

<p>
<b>Early 20th century USA</b><br>
Mealtimes, and meal titles, at the turn of the 20th century were a reflection of social status, not location. Wealthy folks emulated the latest British etiquette while farm families and poorer folks stuck to the 
traditional agrarian standards. Folks living in institutional settings (military, hospitals, schools, prisons) ate 
according to regulations. 
For example: A wealthy person's dinner party would commence anywhere from 6-8PM, while a mid-western farm family might be 
sitting down to dinner (their main meal of the day) at noon. The wealthier you were, the later (and longer) the breakfast.
 Lunch cut across all social classes at this time. Priviledged ladies entertained each other with fancy luncheons while 
factory workers and school children chowed down sandwiches in brief, prescribed breaks. Regardless of time and place, the 
general distinction between dinner and supper is the former indicates the main meal of the day; the latter is a light 
repast. If you took your dinner at noon, you supped at 5 or 6. If you took your dinner at 8, you might sup at 11.
Period etiquette books were written for the wealthy and upper middle classes. Meal times and dining notes generally 
address social occasions rather than family (informal) meals.

"The hour for luncheon is usually half after 1, the matter of time being its chief distinction from a breakfast, as the latter is served at noon; though another point of different is that while luncheons are frequently given without any more particular meaning than enjoyment, breakfasts come after certain ceremonies or occasions, as for instance, a wedding breakfast or a hunt breakfast....The dinner hour varies from half after 6 to 8 o'clock."

Formal dinner at 8PM (p. 6); "Formal luncheon is served as a rule at one, half-past one, or two o'clock--not later than the latter hour, lest it spoil the guest's appetite for dinner." (p. 36-7); "The modern supper is not, as a rule, the first and foremost object of an evening's entertainment, but is usually an adjunct to some other form of festivity, such as a theatre or card party, or reception. Among the exceptions to this are the so-called game, wine, and
 fish suppers, popular among the "men-folk." Suppers are of various degrees of formality--from the delightfuly informal chafing-dish "spread" to an affair scarcely less elaborate than the formal dinner...there is no variation from the general rules applying to those features of the formal dinner...[no specific time recommended ] (p. 42-43); "The formal breakfast--or perhaps it would be more accurate to say the company breakfast, for this meal is not as a rule very formal--is much in favor with people of the leisure class...who frequently have considerable time to kill...The hour for a breakfast is usually twelve o'clock, but very often it is as early as ten; never later than noon, for it would then infringe upon the hours appointed by custom for luncheons." (p. 49); "In America the six-o'clock dinner prevails very generally, and the "Five o'Clock Tea" custom has gained comparitively little foothold; it has been adopted by the leisure clases, and is also popular with the college girl, the bachelor maid, the artist, and the so-called Bohemian circle."

"Indeed, the hours for eating must be regulated by the hours of employment. If one is in the whirl of fashionable life of a great city, and nightly out until four or 
five o'clock in the morning, the heavy meal of the day must come late, and a light supper at midnight becomes a necessity. If you are a hard-working farmer, living in the 
country and going to bed between nine and ten, the meal hours must correspond...<b>"Common Sense Hours.</b>--Meals should be timed by common sense. It is probably more healthful to take a rather light breakfast, which, in a malarious countr, should
always incude coffee. At noon a more substantial meal is in order, but as, in this country, several hours of hard work are to follow, it should not be too heavy, and a 
quarter or half hour's rest after it is time well spent. The dyspepsia so common in this country comes from taking, as a habit, more food than is necessary, and then working
hard with head or body immediately afterwards. Digestion requires repose and most people eat far more than nature calls for. The best time for a heavy dinner is after the
hard work of the day is over and a couple or more of hours can be given to comfortable rest, reading, conversation or light amusement. Eat slowly, not to much at any
one meal, take small pieces which can easily be masticated, and do not go directly from the table to violent exercise or severe brain work. Make your dinner (or evening
meal, by whatever name you choose to call it,) a pleasaunt, social affair, which tempts you to linger over it; not a pllace to bolt, in haste, a certain amount of
unmasticated food, and then fly from. Cultivate the beauties and the social aspects of the meal daily, and it will prove not only a delight, but a source of health as well
as of civilization. Then your dinner parties to strangers will need only a little more care than the daily event, not a contrast which upsets the household."<br>

Food historians generally agree "course meals" were made possible by the agricultural revolution, approximately 10,000BC. When humans evolved from 
hunter/gatherers into organized agricultural communities, civilization happened. Farming and domesticated animals provided the stable food base required for more 
advanced activities to flourish. For the upper eschelons, this included leisurely dining and fancy banquets. 
One of the earliest examples we have of meals offered in different courses comes from

<center><font size="5" color="#003366"><b>What is a "square meal?"</b></font></center><br>
What is a square meal? Excellent question with no simple answers. There are two primary schools of thought:
(1) Symbolic/metaphoric (a "square meal" is a substantial, satisfying repast) and (2) An actual <a href="foodfaq7.html#plimmer">scientific
analysis</a> proposed by a British physician in the 1920s. Shaped, to make it easier for people to understand, like a 
square. The simple shape concept was embraced by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
<a href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/Fpyr/pyramid.gif">Food Pyramid</a>, c. 1992. In both cases, a "square meal" is an 
ideal, not a required list of ingredients or recommended dishes.

<b>A brief evolution of "square" concepts in USA social context:</b><br>
"Colonists were calling city blocks laid out on the grid plan squares by the 1760s... By 1832 men used square approvingly to refer to the natural, even gait of a 
good horse in such expressions as a square-gaited horse or square trotter. By 1836 square meant full or complete, as a square meal, though people didn't talk 
about three squares a day until 1882." <br>

<b>Scientific interpretation</b><br>
British Doctor Plimmer is credited for creating dietary recommendations based on nutrients illustrated in "Square Meal" format.
The square was meant to make nutrition science easier for average people to understand. Here is the original
<a href="squaremeal.pdf">Square meal diagram</a>. Happy to provide color photo if you wish.
<p>
"For practical purposes, the easiest way in which to think about a complete diet is in the form of a diagram which we have called 
'A Square Meal.' It is illusterated ...in the middle of the fronticepiece. The large circle represents the bulk of the food, the fuel
foods, which consist of carbohydrate (starches and sugars) with a moderate quantity of fat. To a considerable extent the 
proportion of fat to carbohydrate can be varied without ill-effect, but too high a proportion of fat may upset the digestion. 
Th ordinary proportion is two-thirds carbohydrate to one-sixth fat, dry weight...To make a 'square meal' four corners must be added. In
the diagram the corners are marked respectively...showing how they must be filled by the vitamins to make a complete
daily diet...In the frontispiece the diagram of the square meal is set within a large square subdivided into four sections so it can be
seen at a glance which articles of food must be provided to fill each corner. If the corners are suitably filled and the appetite
satisfied with these good foods, the diet will be well balanced. Many foodstuffs in common use do not contain vitamins. Lists of these
poor foods are shown on the sides of the square. They are placed for comparison outside the main square in line with the foods 
which contain the different vitamins. The food consituents of any meal can be checked against this standard diagram (fronticepiece) 
to see how closely each meal, or the day's food as a whole, approaches to 'squareness.' 
<p>
"Consider a simple meal of bread and
butter, meat and some green salad. The bread supplies carbohydrate...the butter supplies fat, the meat gives protein and mineral salts are contained
in the bread, meat and salad. If enough of these foods be eaten to satisfy a normal appetite, fuel for warmth and energy will
be provided and also building material for growth and repair. The circle is thus properly filled. To toast the 'squareness,' each corner must be considered
in turn. The salad also supplies C. M will not be provided in sufficient amount unless the bread is wholemeal, as none of the other three
foodstuffs supply this vitamin. The meal will not be square unless the bread is wholemeal. The lean of the meat provdes PP or B2."<br>

<b>Additional USA observations</b>
<p> 
<b>[1926]</b><br> 
"A 'square meal' has finally been defined by British scientists after considerable discussion. The term, supposed to have originated in America, should imply more than a 
substantial repast, in the opinion of Dr. Harvey Henry Aldres Plimmer, professor of chemistry at the University of London. 'A square meal,' the professor says, 'should be 
be geometrically square, in the sense that it should embrace the cardinal points of good diet, Vitamins A, B, and C and good protein.' In his campaign against impure foods, 
Sir W. Armuthnot Lane, President of the New Health Society, organized just after the famous surgeon returned from a two months' visit to the United States, says: 'The 
nation requires not only the square meal but also the 'square deal' in regard to the safety and cleanliness..." <br> 
---"'Square Meal' is defined: It should contain three vitamins and protein, says British scientist," <i>New York Times</i>, March 6, 1926 (p. 3)<br>

<p> 
<b>[1927] </b><br> 
"The familiar expression 'a square meal' may be adopted to represent a complete diet supplying all the material that the body needs, say R.H.A. Plimmer of the University 
of London and Violet G. Plimmer in <i>Hygia Magazine</i>. The center of the square is filled with the fat, carbohydrate, mineral salts and water; the corners are filled 
respectively with vitamins A, B, and C and protein P. The corner A represents both the fat soluble vitamin A and D, which are found in the same foods. Foods 
from the same corner may be used alternatively, but a food from one corner is not a substitute for one from another corner. A square meal consists of food from all four 
corners in suitable proportions. Some of the foods in the A corner are butter, red liver, oil, milk, egg yolk and liver. 
In the C corner are the fresh fruits, especially citrus fruits, 
tomatoes and green vegetables, either raw or very slightly cooked; the B corner contains whole meal cereal products, dried peas, beans and lentils and nuts;
 corner D includes meat, 
eggs. milk and cheese." <br>

Food historians tell us the first fork-type utensils were known in 
Biblical days. Modern forks (2 prong) were introduced in the 
eleventh century and spread slowly throughout Europe via Italy. By the 16th century, wealthy 
European diners were using forks. Three prong forks were introduced late 17th century; four tines 
became the norm in the 19th. <a href="foodfaq7.html#knives">Knives</a> predate forks.
<p> 
"Most people carried a knife of the traditional, general-purpose dagger shape, and spoons were not uncommon, but the dinner 
fork was an oddity in most of Europe until the eighteenth century. Kitchen forks had been familiar for hundreds of years, even 
if most of them were only marginally smaller than a farmer's pitchfork. By the tenth century...small gilt ones were being used 
at select Byzantine tables, mainly for sweetmeats, and there were known in Greece 300 or 400 years later. From Greece they traveled 
to Italy, a country whose refined manners had again become the envy of Europe...Yet although Catherine de Medici appears 
to have take not only her cooks but also her entire kitchen with her when she went to France in 1533...the fork did not 
catch on. Nor did it in England seventy years later...Until after 1700, although a few eccentrics used a fork for dining, 
most north Europeans continued to eat with fingers and knives, or spoon and bread..." <br>

"Spikes, not only for spearing meat that is roasting but also for lifting food from the fire or from a food heap and carrying it 
to the diner, are at least as old as the first knives and spoons; a sharp stick must have been one of mankind's earliest tools, in 
cooking and eating as for other purposes. Ancient Romans had spoons with one prong or two at the end of the handle for 
winkling out shellfish, and one-pronged dinner spikes survive from the Middle Ages: a perero, for example, was a spear on which 
one impaled fruit in order to peel it. A fork most simply splits into two tines; early dinner-table forks were generally 
two-pronged, large, and used mostly to help in cutting, and for serving, not eating, food--our carving forks still keep their 
size, shape, and original function. Or there were small "suckett" forks, used to lift preserves like ginger out of jars, or 
to eat fruits, like mulberries, which might stain the fingers. The fork revolution did not...present the world with an utterly 
strange new implement; what did constitute an important change in the West was the spread of the use of forks, their 
eventual adoption by all diners, and their use not only to hold food still while it was cut, but to carry it into people's 
mouths. The first modern fork...is mentioned as having been used in the eleventh century by the wife of the Venetian Doge, 
Domenico Selvo...Forks are mentioned again three centuries later, in 1361, in a list of the plate owned by the Florentine 
Commune. From this time onwards, forks are spoken of frequently; more than two hundred years were to pass, however, before 
they were commonly used for eating...Italy and Spain led the world into the adoption of forks...The use of individual forks 
began to spread as the seventeenth century progressed." <br>

"Forks were...new gadgets, especially in northern Europe, where they were still a rarity at the end of the fourteenth 
century. They were made of gold or silver, like the ten forks appearing in the inventory of the Duke of Berry...Charles V's inventory 
(1380) mentions one fork for eating cheese...Italy was among the first countries to use forks...But it appears that the Catalans 
led the way...But for the menagier and others of the same social rank, the use of forks was certainly limited to eating comfits, 
which were too sticky or powdery to be take between the fingers, wheras 'wet' ones were eaten with spoons." <br>

<p>
"Even after the introduction of forks, it remained customary for dinner guests to provide their 
own utensils for eating. This undoubtedly explains the ingenious one-piece combinations which 
were made to serve the purpose of a spoon and fork. The three pronged fork would serve as the 
handle for a spoon bowl, by fitting the prongs in two loops and fastening it to the back. The 
handle hinged back to permit folding for convenience when carrying in a pouch...The earliest 
known fully hallmarked English fork is dated 1632. It is 7 inches long, two pronged, and bears 
the interesting crest of the Earl of Rutland. It remains today on exhibition at the Victoria and 
Albert Museum in London. There was very little change in the style of forks made from the 
beginning, until nearly the middle of the seventeenth century. At this time, a three pronged types 
with a flat rectangular handle appeared that closely resembled the Puritan spoon. This was 
probably copied from a contemporary French specimen...Until about 1730, English forks are 
found having two, three or four prongs. Thus the number of prongs cannot indicate any particular 
period. While in the commonwealth, three prongs are common, after the Restoration three or four 
prongs were in use and dating from the reigns of William III and Queen Anne, many have only 
two tines." <br>

"By the time the fork came into popular use in the 17th century, sets of a knife, fork, and spoon 
were treated as highly personal tools, and were carried around by their owners and used not only 
at home but in other houses where they might be guests or at inns while traveling. Such sets were 
made with cases, and later, were designed so that they might be folded, with the handle of the 
knife and fork acting as a protective shield for the sharp blade and tines. The pistol-grip handle, 
still greatly admired for the way it fits the hand, and the wide, flared top commonly used even 
today for fork and spoon handles, were originally designed to sheath the sharp and pointed 
working members of traveling tableware. These portable implements continued to be popular in 
the early days of American colonization, and were made by some of the early silversmiths in the 
Colonies....It closely resembles earlier sets of "pocket tools." During the 18th century, the 
personalized, portable tableware sets continued to be popular with travelers, but well-equipped 
houses began to include, among other appointments, knives, forks, and spoons for guests as well 
as family. Since these pieces traveled only from knife box to table and scullery and back again to 
the sideboard, the folding feature was dispensed with; but even the fixed handles retained the 
wide shapes of the earlier sheath handles, ...The pistol-grip handle continued into the reign of 
George III..." <br>

"It should not be necessary to refute the oft-told tale that roasts did not grace the English table until after the general 
acceptance of the individual table fork, usually placed around mid-seventeenth century, although Ben Johnson, for one, know of the use 
of "your silver fork" in polite society by 1605 (Volpone) and the use of carving forks and even specialized serving forks antedated 
that by perhaps centuries. Too much is made of the use of a fork as an instrument of civilized eating; the lack of it never 
prevented the enjoyment of roast meat of all kinds by the English and other Europeans, as the slightest acquaintance of literature 
or period art would show, to say nothing of the peoples of the Middle, Near, and Far East; who have managed to enjoy opulent feasts 
with exquisite manners without the help of a fork." <br>

"When the Pilgrims sailed for the American colonies, dinner forks had only recently arrived in England. The newfangled affectation of 
forks was anathema to Puritan culture. Only after worldly and wealthy tradesmen and governors settled in the colonies did forks' 
slowly appear...Most seventeenth-century American forks were to spear suckett, or preserved ginger and sweetmeats, and had two 
slender tines with a spoon bowl at the opposite end. Other early forks were convertible fork-spoons, which could be carried by 
their owners, or cooking forks of iron. Although silver three-tined dinner forks made in eighteenth-century America survive, most were 
iron or steel with two sharp tines that steadied a piece of meat while it was being cut with a knife. Morsels were then take to the 
mouth with the knife blade. Such forks were produced in England from the late sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries. Americans 
used them well into the nineteenth century. Three- and four-tined silver forks gained popularity in America in the early 
nineteenth century and the two-tined variety came be be regarded as rustic and vulgar. During this transitional period, 
President Andrew Jackson purportedly offered guests both a silver and a steel two-tined fork...However, by 1860 
American etiquette writers declared that the three- or four-tined forks were de rigueur...Late-nineteenth-century Americans 
developed a fanaticism for forks. Oyster forks, produced in England from 1790 and retailed by Tiffany from at least 1846, 
were requisite at smart American dining rooms by 1860. From 1864, etiquette books instructed diners to cut pastry with the edge 
of a fork, never the knife...By the 1880s pastry forks with a thickened tine were commonly available on the American market. 
A decade later individual salad and lettuce forks were also sold. Fruit, melons, strawberries, sandwiches, bread, and even ice cream 
merited their own forks. Turn-of-the-century etiquette books declared, "Never use a knife or spoon when a fork will do." <br>

<b>Knives</b><br>

"...the fact is that people have commonly eaten food impaled in the points of their knives, or carried it to their mouths
balanced on blades; the fork is in this respect merely a variant of the knife. With the coming of forks, knife-points 
became far less useful than they had been; their potential danger soon began in consequence to seem positively barbaric.
The fist steps in the subduing of the dinner knife were taken when the two cutting edges of the dagger-like knife were reduced
to one. The blunt side became the upper edge, which is not threatening to fingers when they are holding knives in the polite
manner. According to Tallement des Reaux, Richelieu was so appalled by the sight of Chancellor Seguier picking his teeth with
a knife, that he ordered all the knife-blades in his establishment to have their points ground down to innocuously rounded
ends. It later became illegal in France for cutlers to make pointed dinner knives or for innkeepers to lay them on their 
tables. Ohter countries soon followed suit. Pointed knives for all diners were later to retun to the dining-room table, but as 
"steak" knives, which have a special image, linked deliberately with red meat and "getting down to business" when hungry. They
are still quite rustic in connotation...An interim period followed the introduction of rounded knives, as forks began to make
their way in to the world. For a while, people were occasionaly exhorted to eat only with the back of the knife-blade, blunted
as it now often was...Special knives appeare with widened, not merely rounded, blade ends. The English in the eighteenth century,
so Le Grand d'Aussy tells us, were given to using this knife like a sort of flat spoon, even for eating peas...Spikes, not only for
spearing meat that is roasting but also for lifting food from the fire or from a food heap and carrying it to the diner, are
at least as old as the first knives and spoons; a sharp stick must have been one of mankind's earliest tools, in cooking and
eating as for other purposes. Ancient Romans had spoons with one prong or two at the end of the handle for winkling out
shellfish, and one-pronged inner spikes survive from the Middle Ages...A fork most simply splits into two tines..."<br>

"In the United States, knives remained the primary utensil well into the nineteenth century. American knives had wide,
rounded blades that conveyed food to the mouth like a kind of individual flat spatula. By that date, it had been forgotten
that Europeans had once eaten from knife blades; the practice was perceived as distinctly American. In The Young Lady's Friend of 1837,
Eliza Ware Farrar maintained: 'If you wish to imitate the French or English, you will put every mouthful into your mouth with
your fork; but if you think, as I do, that Americans have as good a right to their own fashions as the inhabitants of any other country,
you may choose the convenience of feeding yourself with your right hand, armed with a steel blade; and provided you do it 
neatly, and do not put in large mouthfuls, or close your lips tightly over the blade, you ought not to be considered as
eating ungenteely.' However, by 1845 <i>The Art of Good Behavior</i> advised: "If possible the knife should never be put into the mouth
at all, and if at all, let the edge be turned downward." Seven years later, <i>The Art of Pleasing</i> declared that diners should "eat always
with a fork or spoon," though it acknowledged that this was not possible at old-fashioned houses...In his seminal work <i>The 
Civilizing Process</i>, the twentieth-century sociologist Norbert Elias argued that the knife's importance diminished as society
deemed it vulgar to brandish a sharp-tooled object at the table For this same reason, knife blades became as nonthreatening
as possible. Fish knives, a mid-nineteenth century European invention, have trowellike silver blades. Butter knives, an
American innovation of similar date, likewise sport silver blades, as do salad knives."<br>

"There was a fashion in Europe during the nineteenth century for downplaying the knife to such an extent 
 that one was not only to use it as little as possible but to put it aside when it was not in use. You cut up 
 your food with the knife in the more capable hand and the fork in the other; you then put down the knife, 
 being careful to place it with the blade's edge toward the centre of the plate, not facing neighbours. Then 
 the fork changed hands, and was used to take the cut food to the mouth. More elaborate manners 
 demanded that one should perform this manoeuvre for every mouthful consumed. Using only one hand 
 thought polite...and only the right hand is often de riguer. Eaters adhering to this fashion thought that 
 people who ate with both hands holding on to the cutlery were gross and coarse. What Emily Post calls 'zig-zag' eating
 was still customary among the French bourgeoisie in the 1880s, when Branchereau describes it. He says, however that the 
 English are successfully introducing a new fashion; they hang on to their knives, and take the food to their mouths with the 
 left hand which is still holding the fork. Eating in the 'English' manner means that the fork, having just left of being an 
 impaling instrument, must enter the mouth with the tines down if it is not to be awkwardly swiveled round in the left, or
 less capable hand. Food must therefore be balanced on the back of the rounded tines. This has two advantages for polite
 behaviour. First, a fork thus held encourages the mouth to take the food off it quickly and to close the lips...
 The second advantage is that denying a modern fork its possible spoonlike use is wantonly perverse...The former way of
 eating was not dislodged in North America as it was in the rest of the world. It has been suggested by James Deetz that the old way was more
 deeply entrenched in America because forks arrived relatively late. According to this theory, Americans remained attached to eating with their
 spoons; they would cut food (probably holding it still, when necessary, with their fingers or their spoons), then lift it in a spoon, first
 shifting it if necessary to the right hand, to their mouths. Forks, imported from Europe, were certainly used sometimes used not only for
 impaling food but for transporting it into the mouth...But soon forks took their modern spoonlike form, so that they could be treated, after the 
 spearing and cutting was done, as though they were spoons. Europeans, meanwhile, kept eating food impaled on the tines." <br>

 "And now comes Dick Figg to fix it all  up and settle all the nice points. It has been considered a proper thing to do 'unfold the napkin at large' and to use
 the fork considerably with the right hand.. But we are now told that this is all wrong, and by one who speaks with an air of sublime confidence, which indicates that he is
 unquestionable authority on the subject, at least in his own estimation. But who is to decide between this oracle and others who have written before him with equal assurance!
  And might we not ask which side up should the fork be held? or ay it be held either side up? And should it be held with the back of the hand up or down, or may it be held both
 ways? And, after cutting off a piece of meat or pie, is it proper to stab it with the fork and then...impaled and..[lift] morsel to the mouth or should the fork me made to

 "Small Points on Table Etiquette. Delicacy of manner at table stamps both man and woman, for one can, at a glance, discern whether a 
 person has been trained to eat well--i.e. to hold the knife and fork properly, to eat without the slightest 
 sound of the lips, to drink quietly, to use the napkin rightly, to make no noise with any of the implements of 
 the table, and last, but not least, to eat slowly and masticate the food thoroughly. All these points should be 
 most carefully taught to children, and they they will always feel at their ease at the grandest tables in the 
 land. There is no position where the innate refinement of a person is more fully exhibited than at the table, 
 and nowhere that those who have not been trained in table etiquette feel more keenly their deficiencies. 
 The knife should never be used to carry food to the mouth, but only to cut it up into small mouthfuls; then 
 place it upon the plate at one side, and take the fork in the right hand, and eat all the food with it. When 
 both have been used finally, they should be laid diagonally across the plate, with both handles towards the 
 right hand; this is understood by well-trained waiters, to be the signal for removing them, together with the 
 plate...The knife can be used to cut the meat finely, as large pieces of meat are not healthful, and appears very 
 indelicate." <br>

 "A social new-comer asks, 'How shall I carry my fork to my mouth?' The fork should be raised laterally to the mouth with the right hand; the wrist should ever be
 crooked so as to bring the hand round at a right angle, or the fork directly opposite the mouth...the fork should not be overloaded. To take meat and vegetables and pack them
 on the poor fork, as if it were a beast of burden, is a common American vulgarity, born of our hurried way of eating at railway stations and hotels. But it is an
 unhealthy and ill-mannered habit. To take but little on the fork at a time, a moderate mouthful, shows good manners and refinement. The knife must never be put into the
 mouth at ay time--that is a remnant of barbarism."<br>

 "There are various and sundry ways of holding the knife and the fork. English people dine with the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right. In America it is quite the other way. One-handed eating is the rule. That is, 
 we eat with the fork held in the right hand. We transfer it to the left only when the knife has to be used in cutting. The minute we have finished with the knife we put it down on the plate, and transfer the fork back to the right
 hand. Whether you are going to use the American or English way of eating, learn to handle your silver with ease. The daintiest way is to let the fork rest with the prongs up on the side of the middle finger and the first  finger 
 joint, held in place by the tips of the thumb and index finger. Let the fourth and little fingers curl under the fork. Don't let them stick out at an affected 
angle."<br>

 "What's the correct way to use the knife and fork? Knives and forks are used either American or Continental fashion but a combination of the two systems is now often
 seen and is quite acceptable. Even when one uses the American zigzag system, it is not necessary to lay down the knife, place the fork tines up, in the right hand to convey
 a bit of cut-up chop to the mouth. Instead one may place the eat in the mouth with the left hand with the tines of the fork down."<br>

 "Manners and Food: Knives and Forks. Many Americans who travel a great deal have changed from the American zig-zag method of eating to the Continental style. However, both methods
 are correct--if properly executed--and so is a modified version of the two. Here are the basic differences and the correct way to use each system:
 American.
 The knife is used only for cutting and is then placed on the side of the plate with the blade toward the center of the plate. The fork is then switched to the right hand 
 and the food is conveyed to the mouth with the tines up. However, it is usual (and sensible) to use the fork in the left hand, tines down, for food one has just cut. The tines
 of the fork are kept down, also, regardless of which hand is used, to eat a bit of bread and gravy. Vegetables and other foods which do not require cutting are eaten with the 
 fork in the right hand, tines up. A small bit of bread may be used as a block for evasive foods such as peas.
 Continental
 Using this method, you convey all food to the mouth with the fork always in the left hand, knife in the right. 'Slippery' foods such as peas, and 'drippy' foods such as
 creamed celery, are guided onto the fork, tines up, with the knife, but meat, potatoes and other vegetables are impaled with the fork, tines down, or guided onto the back of
 the fork with the knife. The biggest mistake newcomers to this method make is to pile up and pack down food on the back of the fork. The old rule of never putting more food on 
 the fork or spoon that will comfortably fit in one's mouth applies to both methods of eating.
 ...Whichever method you use, the important thing is to manipulate your knife and fork with ease and assurance, and with enough grace not to offend others. Never
 apologize, for feel you need to apologize, for the style in which you eat. Europeans acknowledge our method just as we should accept theirs."<br>

 "Americans who travel abroad for the first time often wonder why Europeans handle their knives, forks and spoons in ways so contrary to American custom. The Continental
  way of dining involves the simutaneous use of fork and knife. The ofrk is held in the left hand, the knife in the right. At no time is the knife put down and the fork
 transferred to the right hand. The knife is used not only for cutting, but also to press doods onto the back of the fork. According to Emily Post, it is Americans and not the rest of the 
 Western world who are out of step. As long ago as 1922, when Mrs. Post's book on etiquette was first published, she deplored the zigzag custom in which the fork is constantly
 transferred from the left ot the right hand, saying it was 'strange' and 'not seen at the tables of fashionable people.' Amy Vanderbilt, however, believes that either
 custom is propler, a long as it is performed with ease and grace. 'But the Continental style often encourages people to bolt their food,' Miss Vanderbilt warned. 'I've 
 noticed that women who dine in the European fashion way often bend too far over the table in a way that is less than elegant.' Many Americans stoutly defend their custom
 and say that to adopt foreign ways would be an affectation. Others, however, have chosen to switch because the European manipulation of table implements seems faster and more efficient.
  Rober Meyzen, maitre d'hotel of La Caravelle restaurant, reports that more and more Americans are adopting the Continental method. 'I think that people are beginning to realize that to 
 put the knife down after cutting the meat, aand then to switch the fork into the right had represents a loss of both time and taste,' Mr. Meyzen said. There is speculation as to the 
 origin of each method and wy they differ. The American custom, Mrs. Post has suggested, may have started as a way to slow down children who were fast eaters. Mr. Munves Jr., of
 James Robinson, dealers in antique silver and tablewares, says it may be traceable to the robber barons of the 19h century. 'It was a form of pretentiousness adopted here
 around 1880, when the robber barons went respectable...But by now, it would be more pretentious than practical for people to return ot the old, or European way of eating' 
 In commenting on the same era in America, James Beard, a gourmet and cookbook author, said: 'It was considered more elegant to sit with one had in your lap during most of 
 a meal than to use both hands to simlify dining."<br>

 <p>

<b>[1983]</b><br>
 "Because most American customs and rules of etiquette are drawn from those of Europe, any that differ are of special interest. How did the differences come about and what do
 they represent, if anything?...Americans differ from Europeans in the use of the knife and fork. Europeans hold the for in the left hand and the knife in the right and, when food is
 cut, it is carried to the mouth by the left hand. The knife is always in use, not only for cutting, but also for pushing and for dabbing gravy onto the potatoes and other
 such useful functions. There are some differences between the English and the Continentals, for though both keep forks in the left hand, the English keep the tines turned over and 
 pile food onto the back of the fork. Beginning with eat as a platform, they may smooth on potatoes into which they press peas and then transport the whole mouthful at once.
 Other Europeans turn the tines over after cutting and push food onto the fork with a knife. But for many years American etiquette dictated that the fork must be switched to the
 right hand after the food is cut, and that the knife should rest on the edge of the plate. During actual eating, the left hand was supposed to lie idle on the lap. This cumbersome
  and awkward switching of hand continues today even though it was declared out of date as far as 1848 in 'Vogue's Book of Etiquette,' written by Millicent Fenwick, who was
 then an associate editor of Vogue and is now the United States representative to the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization in Rome. After describing the old rule, Mrs.
 Fenwick wrote, 'Today, it is reversed so commonly that the left handed method is almost preferred to the other. Both are perfectly good usage, but it is now axiomatic that whenever 
 food is cut with a knife, the left hand can quite naturally carry it up to the mouth'...Even through the European method is smoother and more efficient, as any time-motion study would prove, most Americans persist 
 in this 'zigzag' method, as it is described in 'The New Emily Post's Etiquette' by Elizabeth L. Post. The author suggests that Americans are reluctant to follow the European
 method because they feel it would be 'putting on airs to adopt a foreign way of eating.' Ms. Post advises, 'I can see nothing wrong in adopting a custom that sees more practical
 than your own.' Letitia Baldridge, who revised 'The Amy Vanderbilt Complete Book of Etiquette,' also considers the Continental style more 'sensible.' In preparing this book,
 which was published in 1978, Miss Baldridge tried in vain to discover how the zigzag method developed in the United States. 'I even called the Library of Congress but they could not come up with
 anything,' she said...Perhaps in the early days of our country, the change in rules was a populist protest against royalists. Or, as a European friend suggested, one-handed eating may be a
 holdover from frontier days, when it was necessary to keep one hand at the ready for self-defense. Left-handed Americans have, perhaps, the best of both worlds. Those I know hold the fork in the
 right hand, cut with the knife in the left hand and eat without changing hands. Thereby they follow the European school of nonswitching, but eat with the right hand and so 
 draw no undue attention from their counterparts."<br>

different dishes, sharing tidbits and discoveries, not only stretches out a pleasant social evening
but bonds friends together in a very emotional way. In fact, the
very word "companion" comes from the Latin com panis, or "with bread," meaning the person
you share meals with -- friendship defined by dining...The most familiar versions are Middle
Eastern mezze and their Spanish derivatives tapas; Chinese dim sum (meaning, sweetly, "touch
the heart"); French canapes and hors d'oeuvres (themselves derived from the Russian zakuski);
and Italian antipasti. In Vietnam, such drinking dishes are called "do nhau" -- literally, "little
bites," and sounding not unlike "doughnut." The Thai, who might be the world's masters of
outdoor gourmet dining, call them "kanto." Indians refer to samosas and other such little fried
finger foods, cheerfully enough, as "chat." <br>

<a name="antipasto">
<b>Antipasto</b><br>
Antipasto denotes the dishes served before (anti) the pasta (pasto) course. These are often similar
to those served for gustatio. Antipasto is also more broadly defined as  'before the meal,' referring
to all food served as appetizers. Alan Davidson's <i>Oxford Companion to Food</i> states:
"Typical itmes are olives, pieces of raw or cured ham, marinated mushrooms or other vegetables,
and items of seafood. As the popularity of Italian food increased in the second half of the 20th
century this term acquired wide currency in English" (p.22)
<p>
"Antipasto...is an Italian term for  'hors d'oeuvres'...English actually took the word over in the
sixteenth century, and partially naturalized it to antepast ( The first mess [course], or antepast as
they call it, is some fine meat to urge them to have an appetite,' quoted in the Harleian
Miscellany, 1590)."<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 7)
<p>
[in the 19th century]" The debate on popular, bourgeois, and aristocratic cooking influence the
structure of the meal, modifying it profoundly. Many dishes were moved to a subsequent course,
while others were assigned a new role...Among the many issues related to form, the question of
the antipasto was the most important. With its profusion of different foods, it was the only part of
the meal that reflected the courses offered on the tables of the aristocracy. Its evolution in the
bourgeois meal continued to be tied to the stimulation of appetite and the dietary organization of
the menu. The success it attained in lower-middle-class festivities, in trattorie and fine restaurants,
and its decline at the dinner table made it all the more enigmatic, especially since its contents
altered without ever changing completely...From the historical viewpoint antipast should not
really be considered in the category of hors d'oeuvre. The term antipasto first appears in the
sixteenth century, and Domenico Romoli usues it in the modern sense to mean the initial course.
The term "hors d'oeuvre" by contrast is used by Massailot in Paris in 1691 to indicate dishes,
such as artichoke hearts or pork trotters, that served as a supplement to the first of second course,
as a kind of entrements that could also be presented after the roast. Etymologically, as Panzini
shows, if a meal is considered to be the main project (oeuvre), then preparations that are
supplementary or marginal to it are considered outside (hors) its scope. <i>Il cuoco
piemontese</i> (The Piedmontese cook), written in 1766, uses the term in this sense, citing 
supporting soups as the hors d'oeuvre but limits its use to the first course. It was only in the
following century that "antipasto" and "hors d'oeuvre" became synonymous. Romoli reflects the
appetizing function of this course by proposing fresh, unsalted cheese, capers, and little fritters,
which are meant to stimulate the appetite without filling the stomach. It was initially a cold but
very varied course..."<br>

Artusi, in <i>Science in the Kitchen and the Art of Eating Well </i>( c. 1891) adds: 
"Appetizers or antipasti are, properly speaking, those delicious trifles that are made to be eaten either after the pasta course, as is practiced in Tuscany, which seems preferable to me, or before, as is done elsewhere in Italy. Oysters, cured meats such as prosciutto, salami, mortadella, and tongue, or seafood such as anchovies, sardines, caviar, "mosciame" (which is the salted back of the tuna fish), etc., may be served as appetizers, either alone or with butter. In addition, the fried breads I describe below make excellent appetizers." 
Artusi's recipes include Crostini di Capperi (canapes with capers), Crostini di Tartufi (truffle canapes), Crostini de Fegatini di Pollo (canapes with chicken livers), Crostini de Fegatini di Pollo Con La Salvia (canapes with chicken livers and sage), Crostini di Beccaccia (woodcock canapes), Crostini Diversi (various canapes), Crostini di Caviale (caviar canapes), Crostini di Accuighe (anchovy canapes), Crostini die Caviale, Acciughe E Burro (canapes with caviar, anchovies and butter), Sandwiches, Crostini de Fegatini e Acciughe (canapes with chicken livers and anchovies), Crostini di Milza (canapes with spleen), Crostini Fioriti (fancy canapes), and Baccala Montebianco (salted codfish mont blanc style).

serve as a foretaste of the delights to come in the meal, and are served on small dishes in what can
amount to an incredible number, depending on the formality and importance of the meal. The
impressive variety of these appetizers range from the simply presented olives or cheese to more
complex preparations such as eggplant puree and hummus....The serving of these tidbits of food is
believed to have been carried by the Arabs to the Iberian Peninsula during the 900 years the Arabs
were in that part of Europe. The Spanish tradition of gathering before a meal for a drink and the
sampling of endless appetizers called 'tapas', batches the Arab custom (but without the drinks for
Muslims), and to a large extent this pleasant precursor to an elaborate meal is found only in the
Middle East and in Spain."<br>

"Andalucia and its Tapas...Sevilla is also the place to go for 'tapas', whcih may be the most fun
part of Andalusian cuisine...The origin of the word tapa, which literally means cover, seems to
go back to the middle of the last century, from the name given to the slice of ham, cheese or
bread used to cover the wineglass served to the horsemen as they arrived at the roadside inn tired
and thirsty. The tapa protected the wineglass from dust or rain. In fact, the tapa was free--the
patron paid only for the wine...The variety of tapas is almost as extensive as the entire Spanish
gastronomy..."<br>

"The tapas tradition--that delightful Spanish custom of gathering before lunch and again before
dinner for a glass of wine or beer and a sampling of appetizers--is so very popular in Spain as
much for the Spaniard's overriding need for company and conversation as for the delicious food,
which may range from the sophisticated to the most simple fare...Tapas will be found in even the
smallest bar in the tiniest village. The choice in such places will typically be limited to cured ham,
chorizo, and cheese, unless there is someone unusally inventive in the kitchen. But it is in the big
regional centers of Madrid, Barcelona, Santiago de Compostela, Sevila, and Malaga where tapas
often become inspired and are of an overwhelming variety. The Bar Gayango in Madrid is perhaps
the epitome of a tapas bar, where no less than seventy-six tapas...are available...Tapas are
sometimes taken on the honor system, but in general are served by waiters...The word tapa,
meaning cover or lid, is thought to have originally referenced to the complimentary plate of
appetizers that many tascas would place on top of one's wineglass--like a "cover." Anything,
however, served in small portions can be considered a tapa...Tapas and first course dishes are
often interchangeable...While it is obvious that canapes and tartlets would be served only as tapas,
any of the clam or mussel dishes are also excellent as first-course offerings."<br>

"Tapas are savour snacks served in Spanish bars, and typically washed down with glasses of cold
vino or manzanilla sherry. They are now of considerable diversity, ranging from simple olives,
potato salad, and small spicy sausages to fried shrimps, stuffed peppers, and squid cooked in its
ink. The word tapa literally means  'lid' in Spanish, and its gastronomic application comes from the
practice of covering glasses or jugs of drink on the bar with edible  'lids', such as a piece of bread
or sausage, to keep out the flies."<br>

"The masterpiece of Russian cuisine is the 'zakuski', or hors d'oeuvre, ceremony. Limited to the
role of an overture in other cuisines, 'zakuski' are the equivalent of a whole first movement in a
formal dinner...By the early nineteenth century, it became fashionable in sophisticated homes to
serve 'zakuski' on a separate table in the dining room or in an adjacent room, where they were
eaten buffet-style. In a less formal arrangement, the diners were seated around the dining table on
which a variety of hors d'oeuvre was displayed. In restaruants, hors d'oeuvre were served one at a
time or in groups at the dining table....Depending upon the occasion and their financial position
of the hosts, the 'zakuski' menu included:<br>
one or more fish hors d'oeuvre<br>
one or meat hors d'oeuvre<br>
one or more salads and vegetable hors d'oeuvre<br>
one or more egg hors d'oeuvre<br>

Four tureens of different soups were placed at the corners of the table, while the entrees--light
'made dishes' indended to serve as an introduction to the most substantial meats that came
later--were ranged tidily along the sides (hence 'side dishes'). When the soups had been disposed
of,
the tureens were removed and replaced with four dishes of fish (hence the name releve, or
'remove',
for this second installment of the first course). This was not all, however. The peaceful
consumption of soup, fish and entrees was constantly interrupted by servants offering platters of
salted or preserved meats, or hot dishes of kidneys, liver and the like. These, which were in effect

familiar sight in restaurants, incorporating up to several dozen little recipients containing the
various delicacies on offer. Typical items would be anchovies, sardines, slices of smoked fish,
olives, radishes, sliced tomato (or other salad vegetable), various sorts of sausage and other
charcuterie, etc. Hot hors d'oeuvres could be miniature savoury pastries or tiny fritters or other

not be the case in smaller establishments, where the plain cook will have to attend to these, in addition to her ordinary work;
this list of hors-d'oeuvre has therefore appeared to me to have its proper place in domestic cookery. It is customary to dish up

"Cold and Hot Hors-d'Oeuvre<br>
The name of these types of preparation clearly defines their place in the menu. They are adjuncts,
and if omitted from the menu should not alter the general harmony of the meal, especially where
dinner menus are concerned. It is therefore indicated that they should be composed of light items
of a delicate nature and they should not constitute a complete dish in themselves. But if these
items are any less in terms of quantity they should be compensated for this by being of an
excellent taste and by giving careful attention to the presentation--both of these should be above
reproach. There are two types--cold Hors-d'oeuvre and hot Hors-d'oeuvre--each being entirely
different from the other, both from the point of view of preparation and service...As a general rule
cold Hors-d'oeuvre are suitable only in a meal which does not include a soup...However, this rule
is not always observed especially in a la Carte restaurants; it is a means more usually of serving
de-luxe Hors-d'oeuvre such as caviare, oysters, plovers' eggs etc. which do not have an undue
influence on the digestion as would be so in the case of fish, salads and marinated vegetables. It is
often noted that at least most of the time when these are offered, their use as Hors-d'oeuvre is
nothing more than an expedient to occupy the customer whilst waiting for the preparation of the
dishes he may have ordered (p. 120)...The hot Hors-d'oeuvre of our modern service are the old
Entrees Volantes or side dishes of the French Service which have survived but with a change of
name; their use, however, remains the same. They sometimes figure on luncheon menus together
with cold Hors-d'oeuvre coming after them, but their real place is on the dinner menu where they
come after the soup and serve as a link between this and the main dishes. Nowadays, there is an
unfortunate tendency to exaggerate the amount and importance of hot Hors-d'oeuvre: it is too
easily forgotten that the essential characteristic of these preparations is their lightness and
delicacy. From the point of view of gastronomic logic they can be deemed superfluous and
nothing except custom justifies their use. (P. 133)<br>

<a name="smorgasbord">
<b>Swedish smorgasbord</b><br>
Sweden's traditional smorgasbord offers guests a variety of small foods presented on a common
table. It can be complicated (with courses) or simple (small foods meant as appetizers).  Guests
are invited to help themselves to whatever pleases them. Smorgasbord relates to the American
"cocktail hour" in that these foods are typically offered with alcoholic drinks, similar to hors
d'oeuvres.
<p>
"Smorgasbord. The best-known feature of the cuisine of Sweden, is related to the Russian
Zakuski and also to Hors D'oeuvres and Mezze, but less closely to Tapas. It assumed something
like its present form in the course of the 19th century, following old traditions of placing all foods
on the table at once and of guests bringing their own contributions. Nowadays, it is usually
prepared by the hostess, without contributions, and consists in an assortment of cold dishes,
cometimes supplemented by hot ones, served either as the preliminary to a meal...or as a full
buffet meal. The literal meaning of the term is 'buttered-bread table', which might lead one to
expect an array of open sandwiches. In practice the various savoury items (cured herring in
various forms, other seafood delicacies, cold meats, various salads, and cheeses) are presented
with various Swedish crispbreads or the like, and only a few items, if any, would appear as
miniature open sandwiches. When smorgasbord is a full buffet meal, a typical sequence of
 course' would be herring (always first); other seafood items such as gravlaks; what are called
 small warm dishes'...cold meats and the like; cheese/fruit/light dessert."<br>

<b>Swedish smorgasbord in the United States</b><br>
"Smorgasbord. A buffet meal of Swedish origins that has become in this century a very popular
party spread. The word...first appeared in American print in 1893. The idea soon caught on, so
that by 1941 the West Hartford Ladies Aid Society Swedish American Cook Book listed several
suggestions for a smorgasbord, including the following items: butter balls, Swedish rye bread,
pumpernickel, hardtack, pickled herring, baked ham, smoked tongue, lingonberries, radish roses,
omelets, "Rulle Pulse" (rolled pressed lamb), "liver pastej" (liver paste), jellied veal, head cheese,
hot Swedish meatballs, Swedish pork sausage, brown beans, Swedish fish pudding, smoked
salmon, stuffed eggs, potato salad, "sill salad" (herring salad), meat and potato sausage, fruit
salad, Swedish apple cake, and coffee with cream. Today smorgasbords may still contain many of
these same times, as well as dishes from other countries."<br>

"[The Fifties] While French cooking carried the most cachet (and was considered the most
difficult), Scandinavian cookery--to go with the plethora of blond Danish Modern furniture and

Scandinavian restaurants were popular...Scandinavian food was most often found a buffet parties.
For what could be more modern, more chic, more fun, and easier, than a smorgasbord at a party?
Said House & Garden (November 1959), "As a good delicatessen can supply the bulk of the fish
appetizers, cold cuts, Scandinavian cheese and breads, you can afford to spend time making salads
and hot foods and preparing and garnishing one or two spectacular dishes such as a Swedish
salmon in aspic." Decorations for a smorgasbord were easy, too. All the hostess needed were a
few Swedish straw stars, some slim white candles, and the food, arrayed on teak trays, Swedish
crystal bowel, and gleaming chafing dishes. To go with the food: beer and aquivit...and pots of
strong, hot coffee...Salmon in aspic never caught on big as a party dish, but Swedish meatballs
became an American standard for both home eating and for buffets.<br>

hovers for months outside the door...The food of which a somrgasbord is traditionally composed are sufficeitnly dissimilar to 
require at least three plates and silver services per person...Typical of those [dishes] first presented are herring, hot and cold,

mountains of butter balls...With the first change of plate come cheeses, deviled eggs, pancakes and omelets with lingonberries,

<blockquote><b>"General Remarks"</b><br>
The custom among Continental nations of commencing dinner with some savory plate, which shall
stimulate a jaded appetite or serve as a whet to the palate, is gaining ground, probably more in
deference to fashion than from individual requirement. As to the wisdom of the practice, much
difference of opinion exists. On the one hand, it is asserted that such dishes are injurious, where
appetite and digestion are lacking, and that given a good appetitie, they are quite unnecessary;
while on the other, it is urged that they are in many cases of real benefit. But between the two
extremes--from the Russian habit of indulging in several varieties of highly-flavoured food,
followed by strong liqueur or spirit, to the oyster served au naturel, declared by many to be the
hors d'oeuvre par excellence--there is ample scope for the introduction of little dishes, appetising
and free from injurious properties.<p>
     It should be remembered tht while over-elaboration should be guarded against, in such as
precede a simple dinner, careless service is inexcusable. Dainty service and suitable garnish must
not be neglected; tiny dishes of glass or white china, holding just enough for one person, are most
suitable and effective for dotting about the table; though for less ceremonious occasions large
dishes may be used, say two or three, each containing a distinct variety.<p>
     The following list will enable a selection to be made, and suggest many other combinations.
The chief materials available are anchovies, anchovy paste or butter, beetroot, capers, cress,
celery, chervil, cods' roe paste, cucumber, caviare, herring roes or filets, marinaded herrings,
lemons, lax (Norwegian salmon), mussels, olives plain or stuffed; oysters, pickles, smoked ham,
sausages, tongue, &c.; tarragon, tomatoes, &c. &c. Various potted meats, fish pastes, and
butters, play an important part in the garnishing of the dishes. Many small savouries which would
also be served as Hors D'Oeuvres will be found under that
and other headings later on...." (p.21)

"The 'naturalization' into the American language of the 'strangling, gargling word which is spelled h-o-r-s-d-o-e-u-v-r-e' was surged last night by George Rector, 
author and former restauranteur. Speaking at a Cordon Bleu dinner given in hist honor at the St. Regis Hotel by a comittee of 112 friends knowns as 'Mine Hosts,' 
Mr. Rector suggested that the Amercian name for the 'million and one' kinds of canapes, anchovies, stuffed eggs and the like should be 'mavericks.' Mr. Rector 
pointed out that Representative Maury Maverick of Texas had recently declared that the name should be 'dingle-doos,' but added that he thought this as appellation 
was hardly fitting for anything 'so delicate and important as an artistically compounded set of--well, as appetizers.' 'My suggestion would be that, since the 
Congressman has been the first public man to come forward in this public service, appetizers should be named mavericks--after him,' Mr. Rector continued.
 'Maverick is not only his name--it is a good American word, as much as part of the language as Yankee Doodle. 'It means an unbranded stray horse or steer, 
wandering off by itself and any man's for the taking. If that doesn't describe a large tray fulll of--well, say antipasto--all things that don't belong in any particular 
course, with everybody grabbing at the luscious little bits he likes best, then I'll never try to name anything again.' Mr. Rector, with the unanimous approval of the 
more than 400 who attended the dinner, sent the following telegram to Representative Maverick in Washington informing him of 'the honor bestowed upon him.' :
'Suggest calling the things mavericks Stop A maverick is something that does not belong anywhere in particular and any man can put his brand on it if he can catch it 
Stop And that fits the old-time free lunch just as well as the fancy appetizers in the fanciest hotel in the country Stop Well why not Stop.'"<br>

Breakfast, like most meals, is a moveable feast that depends upon cuisine, culture, and class.

Food historians agree on these three points when it comes to breakfast:<ol>
<li>Most people, in most times (including today) were lucky to partake of this meal.
<li>For most people, in most times (including today) this meal was very simple.
<li>Breakfasts composed of multiple dishes are the priviledge of the leisured wealthy.
</ol>
Most people through time "broke their fast" with a warm drink (soup, tea) and a simple grain
product (rice, oatmeal, bread). This combination stimulated the stomache, preparing it for the
day's meals.
While many "traditional" [British, American] breakfasts items consumed today trace back to
ancient times (eggs, sausage, pancakes, doughnuts/fritters), few people through time were
fortunate enough to enjoy them as is customarily promoted today.  "Traditional" <a
href="foodfaq7.html#britishbreakfast">British</a> 
breakfasts marketed to today's holiday celebrants and vacationers are typically
reminiscent of wealthy-class Victorian fare. <a href="foodfaq7.html#brunch">Brunch</a> is closely
related. Today few people partake of this traditional meal. Why? Time constraints and health
concerns.
<p>
<b>Who ate breakfast?</b><br>
"Even more elusive is the evidence for breakfast. Judging from cookbooks and dietary literature
there was no such meal, or at least it was only recommended for children, invalids and the elderly
who have weak digestive systems and must eat smaller meals more frequently. Nevertheless, there
was such a meal, and some people took it regularly. The word itself comes from the late Latin
<i>disjejunare</i>, meaning "to un-fast' or break the fast of the evening. Remarkably, the word
was contracted in the Romance languages to <i>disnare</i> or <i>disner</i> in Olde French, or
dinner in English. Thus the word dinner actually means breakfast. But the word is not recorded in
English until 1463 in a royal account book that records expenses for breakfast, but it is not
entirely clear whether this was an early dinner or another meal, the one we know know as
breakfast, eaten first thing in the morning."<br>

What time was breakfast?</b><br> 
This is a fascinating study. The answers depend upon who you were, where you lived,
how much money you had, and what you did for a living. As a rule, the more money you had, the
more you ate, the later you ate it, and the more time you spent around the table. Throughout our
country's history, it is not unusual for many hard workers to put in a couple of hours of work
BEFORE breakfast. About <a href="../foodtimeline.org/foodfaq7.html#mealtimes">meal times</a>.

<b>What is an American breakast?</b><br>
The history of the American breakfast is a reflection of the history of our country. What
  people ate for breakfast, how much, and when evolved as our country progressed from 
 native culture to agrarian society, through the industrial revolution and onto modern days. Most
traditional American breakfast items were brought here by the people who settled our
country. Historians confirm eggs (esp. omeletes), sausage, and pancake-type foods have been
enjoyed since Ancient Rome and Greece.
 <p>
  Breakfast also tells the story of social interaction and scientific advancement:<br><ul>
 <li>colonists learned to incorporate "new world" foods into their diets (corn muffins, grits)
 <li>immigrants introduced traditional foods (kuchen, kolache, potato pancakes, doughnuts)
 <li>pioneers learned to adapt their foods for wagon cooking (cowboy coffee, biscuits)
 <li>19th century food reformers advocated a healthy diet (corn flakes, granola, shredded wheat)
 <li>modern convenience (pop tarts, breakfast sandwiches, frozen bagels)
 <li>nutrition legislation (school breakfast programs)

"Breakfast...Native American breakfast consisted of cornmeal mush and perhaps cornbread, both
items the first European settlers adapted for their own breakfasts. The settlers also breakfasted on
a quickly prepared porridge called "hasty pudding," made with cornmeal and molasses. Later
bread or toast and coffee or tea were the usual breakfast, while in the nineteenth century affluence
brought more variety to the diet and larger portions of meats, fish, cheese, bread, jams, and often
a tot of rum or cider. Also popular were pancakes, especially buckwheat pancakes, which were
consumed in stacks with butter and molasses or maple syrup...
     In different parts of the United States different food items are served for breakfast, although a
meals of eggs, bacon, toast, and coffee seem ubiquitious, with the addition in the South of grits,
ham, or biscuits, in the West with chile peppers, and in the Northeast with sausages and
hash-brown potatoes, and in urban restaurants with preparations of eggs benedict, finnan haddie,
melon, french toast, caviar, waffles, Danish pastry, fruit, English muffins, and many other items In
Jewish communities breakfast may consist of bagels and cream cheese.

continued since then, especially a children's breakfast item."<br>

<b>Why do many Americans think of eggs & bacon as breakfast?</b><br>
Excellent question! With no definative answer. 
The American habit of breakfasting with eggs and pork products (bacon, sausage, Taylor Pork Roll) descends from British roots. General notes traditional English 
breakfasts <a href="http://www.greatbritishkitchen.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=66&Itemid=52">here</a>.

Why eggs in the morning? Some hypothesize the practice descends from the days when many people had their own chickens, hense ready eggs supply. Eggs were harvested in the morning. The fresher the egg, the tastier it was. Immediate consumption might also been a a convenience to the cook: eggs eaten are
eggs that do not need to be stored. And then, there's the practical side. Eggs cook quickly.

<b>"Traditional American Breakfast" through time</b><br>
Of course, what people eat in all times depends upon who they are (ethnicity/religion), where they
live (New Orleans? Boston? Des Moines?) and how much money they have (the wealthy usually
have more food choices than the poor). The following menus are not indicative of what all
Americans were eating during specific period. The idea of one homogenous American breakfast
table is a 20th century concept made possible by national-level food production and distribution.

"For breakfast. Have a white cloth, with the folds regular and perceptibble; let each dish be plished with a soft napkin as it is placed upon the table...The plates
may be put in a pile at the left hand of the carver, or at regular intervals around the table...The coffee-urn or pot should have on its brightest face...the cream
or boiled milk should not lack heat, and, not 'to waste its sweetness' on the unappreciating air, should be contained in a covered pitcher of tin or other metal; the 
sugar-basin, wheter of the same as the other dishes or of metal, should be bright and covered, wtih a large-sized tea or sugar-spoon beside it; the cups and saucers may
be placed in heals of three, within the circle of the sugar, slop, and cream vessels. Let the urn or coffee-pot be set at the right-hand side of the person who serves it; and if tea is
used, let it be placed on the same side in a line with it...Sall napkins of doyles, folded in four and ironed very smoothly, may be laid at each plate...Opposite the tray or head
of table, let the steak, or fry...be placed, with a carving-knife and fork before it, and dishes of hominy or boiled rice, or mashed potatoes and boiled eggs or hash, 
opposit each other, and the plates of bread, betwween the steak-dish and tray, having the plates of bread and butter bbetween each two and the castor in the centre; also one
or two salt-stands filled with fine salt and neatly marked with a teaspoon otherwise...These, with a pitcher of ice-water and serveral tumblers, occupying the corners of the table on 
either side of the carver, complete the breakfast table...
<p>
<b>"Bills of fare</b>...Coffee and tea, or chocolate, either or both; broiled beef-steak, or veal or lamb, fried or broiled; with boiled hominy or mashed potatoes, or
potatoes fried, baked, or roasted; and sliced wheat bread and corn breakfast-cakes or griddle-cakes. Broiled or fried chicken; or clams stewed, or fritter, or fried; or 
broiled or fried ham, with eggs fried, boiled, poached or omlet [sic]; with ashed or fried potatoes, and such war and cold bread as may be desired. Salt or fresh fish, fried
or broiled, and hot rolls or cold bbread, with tea or coffee, constitute a very popular family breakfast in summer; there may be the addtion of such a variety of bread, hot or
cold, as may be preferred; and mashed, or fried, or roasted potatoes; or broiled hominy; also dressed cucumbers, or stewed tomatoes, and stewed fruit or ripe bberries.
Clam omlet will benerally be liked by those who are fond of clams. Green sweet corn, boiled, and served with cold meat or steaks, is suitable for breakfast. Smoked beef, 
fried or frizzled, or salt cod, relish; or a bit of salmon or smoked shad, broiled, with the other requisites, make a nice relishing breakfast. Hashed meat, or meat with
potato hash, is sutiable at any time, and with anhy other dishes. Hot rolls or muffins, warm biscuits, velvet cakes or bread cakes, and twisted bread or rye bread, or short 
cakes, are some of the varieties of bread for summer breakfasts, together with dry and milk toast. Bread for breakfast should be cut in slices nearly half an inch
thick, and arranged neatly on a folded napkin or doyle, on flat plates. Rye bread one day old, cut in this way, is much liked. none but the best sweet butter should be brouht to the
breakfast or tea-table.
<p>
<b>"For Winter Breakfasts.</b> Fried oysters; or soft-shell clams, fried; or fried or broiled chicken; or tripe, broiled or fried; with boiled hominy, or hot corn bread
and rolls; and tea or coffee. Buckwheat griddle cakes, with fried steaks, ham, or sausagees, or cold meat or hash, are a popular breakfast for winter. With many
families, buckwheat cakes anre the constant breakfast, with some little varieties of meat, and tea or coffee..during the winter. It will be found more healthful to 
vary occasionally, with corn griddle-cakes, or muffins, or some other hot cakes. The best of sweet butter, and syrup, should be served with these cakes. Head-cheese, with rolls 
and coffee, make a nice breakfast; also fried sausages; or meat or cod-fish cakes. A shoulder of lamb may be boned and broiled; or a breast may be nicely and thoroughly
broiled; or lamb or chickens stewed. Cold meat, sliced, and fried potatoes, and parsnips, fried; with boiled hominy, or corn bread or griddle-cakes, may be liked."<br>

"Breakfast. We are of the opinion that everybody out to eat as little meat as possible, and drink no wine, beer, or any
other liquor at breakfast, no matter what the sex or age, except when prescribed by the physician in case of sickness,
disability, etc. The food may be selected from the following: Bread and Butter, Eggs, Omelets, Fried Fish, Fried Potatoes, or
other vegetables, Sardines, Fruit, according to the season. As for meat, in case some should be eaten, it ought to be cold,
such as fowl or veal, cooked the day before. Muffins, and other cakes or pastes, served warm, are very bad for the stomach
and teeth. The beverage ought to be either coffee, with milk, chocolate, cocoa, choca, or cold water, but do not by any
means drink tea at breakfast. Although cold meat is not by far so injurious as warm meat for breakfast, it ought, 
nevertheless, to be as little partaked of as possible, and especially by the young."<br>

<b>[1916]</b><br>
The average person is not searching for a five-cent breakfast. 'Not how cheap, but how good' should be the sentiment in every American 
home for the new year, especially when considering foods for the family. Most persons would say that a five cent breakfast is for 
five-cent people. It just happens, however, that a five-cent breakfast may be more wholesome and more nourishing than many a two-dollar
meal that is served in the average home. It isn't what you eat, but what you digest, that nourishes the body and builds healthy tissue. In the
average two-dollar meal there is much that not only lacks nutriment, but is really indigestible. Every time an indigestible food is
taken into the stomach the tone of the digestive organs is lowered, strength is impaired and the body is made more susceptible to 
colds, grippe, influenza and other more serious ailments. Many a five-dollar repast served to merry feasters in a hotel does not 
contain a particle of real nutriment. The effort to digest of such food fills the intestines with toxins and to get rid of these the
feaster takes all sorts of salts and other aperients. The expensive foods do not always contain real nutriment and are not always 
easily digested. Two shredded wheat biscuits, heated for a few moments in the oven to restore crispness, and covered with not milk and a little cream, will 
supply more real, body-building nutriment than meat or eggs at a cost of not over five cents. The addition of sliced bananas or 
other fruits will not bring the total cost to over five cents, and this is a meal that is thoroughly digested when the stomach
will reject other foods. The richest man in America could not buy anything better. It contains all the rich, body-building material in the 
whole wheat grain made digestible by steam-cooking shredding and baking. Being thorougly cooked, it requires no preparation and is
always ready to serve."<br>

<b>Breakfast cereal</b><br>
Much is written on the origin, evolution & modern breakfast cereal market. Generally, the commercial breakfast cereals we consume today 
descend from grain/legume-based gruels and pottages. Think: <a href="foodcookies.html#oats">oatmeal</a>. Healthy, filling, economical & easily digested. Granola (granula) was a 19th century interpretation.
<p>

Mass produced dry cereals intended to be combined with milk in a bowl debuted in the early 20th century. Early products were marketed as health foods and served to 
convalescents in sanitariums. In the sugar-crazed 1920s sweeteners were added. This shattered the original consumer demographic and brought breakfast cereal into 
modern homes. 
Todays consumers are confronted with many choices, each presenting a unique set of health claims and marketing strategies.

"If the British are known for any culinary achievement it is the great British breakfast and it was in
this century that it achieved its status. Even in the nineteenth century bacon for breakfast would
become almost de rigeur, even for the lower classes, as long as they could afford it...At the
beginning of Victoria's reign the essence of the breakfast, eggs and bacon, with the eggs cooked
in a variety of ways, had already become the expected way to start the day. The meal began with
porridge or cream of oatmeal...continued with the cooked part, and finished with toast and
marmalade; coffee or tea was drunk with it. Both the porridge and the eggs and bacon could be

<b>Survey of British breakfasts through time</b><p>
<b>[Medieval times]</b><br>
"...what were the mealtimes and how often did people eat in a day? The very poor doubtless ate
when they could, but the slightly better-off peasants seem generally to have eaten three times a
day. These meals consisted of breakfast at a very early hour to allow for dinner at about 9.00
a.m., or not later than 10.00 a.m., and supper probably before it got dark, perhaps at 3 p.m. in the
winter, The times and number of meals were originally derived from the hours of devotions of the
Church. Monks ate the main meal of their day after the celebration of nones, which was nine
hours after daybreak...It has been suggested that breakfast was only eaten by children and
workmen, but certainly by the fifteenth century it was quite commonly taken by everyone.
Breakfast was regularly allowed for in the accounts of Dame Alice de Bryene at the beginning of
the fifteenth century, although the 1478 household ordinance of Edward IV specifies that only
residents down to the rank of squires should have breakfast, except by special order...The time
was only specified as  a convenyent hower', although to break one's fast after devotions was the
generally recommended procedure. Earlier references to breakfast sometimes meant dinner,
literally, in these cases, the first meal of the day."<br>

<p>
"People in the Middle Agest usually ate two meals a day: as substantial dinner around noon, and a
light supper in the evening...Although not officially recognized as a meal through most of the
Middle Ages and frowned on by moralists, breaking the overnight fast too soon for an
early-morning breakfast was a comon practice among peasants and craftsmen, who started work
at
daybreak and found it hard to hold out until dinner. By the fifteenth century, the nobility, too,
began the day with bread, meat, and ale. Also traditionally allowed a small morning meal were
children, the elderly, and the sick. Grown men, not wanting to be associated with these groups,
tended to feel apologetic or embarrassed to admit that they had breakfast."<br>

<b>[Tudor period]</b><br>

"The  'traditional' large British breakfast was not something the Tudors indulged in. Some did not
eat breakfast at all, while those who did generally enjoyed a light meal of bread and sometimes

servants should not be allowed to sit down to eat before they had done some work."<br>

some (cold) ham. Tudors didn't drink coffee or tea. They drank ale (beer) with most of their
meals!

<b>[1660s]</b><br>
"Breakfast when eaten, had no coffee or tea until the early seventeenth century. Beer or ale served
as beverage. The meal varied with individuals, depending upon their prosperity, but usually
consisted of a slice of bread, a glass of ale, beer, or dry wine. Pepys speaks mostly of "drinking
my morning draft" at some ale house...The  morning draught' at the inn, was, in fact, the ordinary
breakfast of the majoity of Englishmen at this time...Pepys did indulge in breakfast. He mentions
breakfast dishes sucha s these "turkey pie and goose, mackerel, pickeled oysters, beef, cake and
ale, collar of brawn, b read, butter and sweetmeats, cold chine of pork, hashed mutton, dish of
cold creame, creame and cakes," and he sices one breakfast menu consisting of "neat's tongue,
wines of all sorts, ale, anchoves, a baffel of oysters, and gammon of bacon." He also mentions a
pot of chocolate several times, which he bought at the inn. Chocolate was introduced into
England about the year 1652...Pepys also writes of going into an inn where he "did send for a cup
of tee (a China drink) of which I never drank before."...Tea is said to have been sold in England as
early as 1635...and presents of it were considered appropriate for princes and other grandees until
the year 1657..."<br>

<B>CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST</b><br>

Food historians generally define "continental breakfast" as a small morning meal consisting of
coffee and bread products. The "continental" designation means continental Europe, excluding
Great Britain, which is well known for its <a
href="http://www.greatbritishkitchen.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=66&Itemid=52">traditional large meat
and
egg-based breakfasts</a>. Most often this meal is connected with France. Why? The original
name for it was "petit dejeuner."
<p>
Acccording to the <i>Larousse de la Langue Francaise</i> [Librarie Larousse:Paris] 1979 (p.
511), the word  'dejeuner', meaning "to take a meal in the morning or afternoon," dates in print to
1155. The term  petit dejeuner' was in use by 1540.
<p>
"What appears to have happened is that as dinner moved later in the day, people were hungrier
first thing in the morning, especially when the evening meal was relatively small. In countries
where the evening meal was larger, breakfast did not become important. In southern Europe it is
still not a proper meal, but merely coffee and perhaps a piece of bread or pastry. In England and
the north the pattern was quite different."<br>
---<i>Food in Early Modern Europe</I>, Ken Albala [Greenwood Press:Westport CT] 2003 (p.
232,234)
<p>
"Breakfast. The first meal of the day, which literally breaks the fast of the night. Two quite
different breakfast traditions can be traced--the first hot drink (and pick-me-up) of the day, and
the first meal of the day, which is much more substantial. In France this is the petit dejeuner, milky
coffee with bread in some form, not commonly called the  'continental' breakfast, and often
bought in the cafe, on the way to work...Other simple foods that are popular for breakfast include
fresh fruit and yogurt."<br>
---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, Completely Revised and Updated [Clarkson Potter:New
York] 2001 (p. 161-2)
<p>
Continental breakfast was known to Americans by the turn of the 20th century. According to this
article from the <i>New York Times</i>, it was not very popular.
<p>
"Undoubtedly it is true that during the past few years there has been a well defined effort to
substitute the Continental breakfast of rolls and coffee for the hearty meal of many dishes that has
so long been served in this country but, though this project has received the support of more than
one American of high social station, it has failed ignominously, and simply because the great mass
of the people agree with William Dean Howells in designating breakfast as their "best meal."<br>

If you are a culinary/business student studying the "business" aspects of continental breakfast
(consumer preference, market trends, innovative ideas) ask your librarian how to access magazine
and newspaper articles. Here you will find notes from travel magazines, hospitality journals (free

<center><font size="5" color="#003366"><b>Brunch</b></font></center><br>
Food historians generally agree brunch is a turn of the 19th/20th century tradition
originating in Britain. The meal descends from hunting luncheons, a substantial leisurely meal consumed by wealthy people at their 
country houses after the morning's activities. While most people focus on the origin of the term to date the meal, we 
have evidence "brunch" existed before the term. This is not unusual in the food world. Like meal times and recipe titles, 
meals names evolve too.
<p>
<b>Where and when was "brunch" first referenced in print?</b><br>
Food historians all cite to the same source(s) but none of them quote from them directly. We have a copy of the original 
<a href="foodfaq7.html#punchbrunch">
<i>Punch</i> article</a> [August 1, 1896]. We're still searching for the oft-quoted, but vaguely dated [1895] <i>Hunter's Weekly</i> reference. If you have a copy, would you please

<p>
<b>Conventional wisdom:</b><br>
"As a family became richer the breakfast grew, almost as a reflection of the power and afflucence
of the British Empire itself. As the map of the world glowed pink, the sideboard in the morning
room began to be laden with extra dishes. It already had a choice of cold cuts, comprised of sliced
meats, and perhaps even a whole leg of ham or tongue...it was a short step to dipping chicken or
pheasant legs in mustard and heating them up in the oven...A <i>Breakfast Book</i> of 1865,
suggesting a huge number of other dishes...brawn, pickled pork, cures and devilled bones, fried
potatoes, pork chops, veal cutlets, bloaters and anchovies. As well as this, the cook could make
us dishes like ham toast, croquettes, hashed game and rissoles...Then there were savoury
puddings, savoury pies, galantines and meat in jelly...Major L., who published <i>Breakfasts,
Luncheons, and Ball Suppers</i> in 1887, divides breakfast into four types: the family breakfast;
the dejeuner a la fourchette, where the items were introduced in courses similar to dinner; a cold
collations (which must produce an ornamental effect); and the ambigu which is  an entertainment of
a very heterogenous character, having the resemblance to a dinner, only that everything is placed
on the table at once; releves, soup, vegetables, and hot entremets are held to be ineligeble...These
are breakfasts designed for the weekend house party; Major L. suggests that they should contain a
variety of items and he repeats much of what we hav heard before: he thinks that sportsmen can
eat whatever they like, but he is concerned that ladies should be more abstemious though he
admits that  they rarely eat meat for breakfast'. By meat he means roasts and cutlets becuase then
he goes on to list what ladies may eat; this includes ham, bacon, chicken, kidneys, roast larks,
broiled duckings and devilled turkey...Such opulence and conspicious consumption of luxuries is
reminscent of Renaissance princes, medieval kings and Roman emperors."<br>

<p>
"Although the meal itself came to glory in the United States, the word is a British invention,
coined in 1895 by Guy Beringer in a visionary article titled "Brunch: A Plea." Instead of England's
early, a postchurch ordeal of heavy meats and savory pies, the author wrote, why
not a new meal, served around noon, that starts with tea or coffee, marmalade and other breakfast
fixtures before moving along to the heavier fare?  By eliminating the need to get up early on
Sunday, brunch would make life brighter for Saturday-night carousers. It would promote human
happiness in other ways as well. "Brunch is cheerful, sociable and inticing," Beringer wrote. "It is
talk-compelling. It puts you in a good temper, it makes you satisfied with yourself and your fellow
beings, it sweeps away the worries and cobwebs of the week.""<br>

The earliest description we find for "brunch" describes the meal perfectly including the odd timing:<br>
"We do not understand by breakfast a meal taken under that name in the afternoon; then it should be called dinner, or at
least lunch; at such a meal, the following dishes may be served:<blockquote>
Calve's head, served cold, Cervelas of any kind found at pork butchers, Headcheese, Mutton Chops, Veal Cutlets, Eggs cooked
in any way, Fried Fish, Fruit according to the season, Galantine of Birds, Galantine of Veal, Ham, Cold Meat of any kind,
Oysters, Omelets, Pate de foie gras, Meat and Fruit Pies, served cold, Salad of Chicken, Salad of Partridge and other

Vegetables, Drinks according to taste."<br>

"Brunch v. Blunch! According to the <i>Lady</i>, to be fashionable nowadays we must 'brunch.' Truly an excellent portmanteau
word, introduced; by the way, last year, by Mr. Guy Beringer, in the now defunct <i>Hunters Weekly</i>, and indicating a combined breakfast
and lunch. At Oxford, however, two years ago, an important distinction was drawn. The combination-meal whn nearer the usual
breakfast hour, is 'brunch' and, when nearer to luncheon, is 'blunch.' Please don't forget this."

"Brunch. Sir,--We were much interested in seeing in the Academy of December 15 an allusion to the word 'brunch.' Does the poet of the 
<i>Westminster Gazette</i> think he has invented it? If so, it is another case of plagiarism. This useful word was introduced
to us about four years ago by a youthful subaltern of artillery, since when we have used it constantly. There are some other words
of the same type which we might mention. 'Brupper' is the joyous meal you have after a very late dance, for instance, and consists
of supper, which might almost be breakfast. 'Brea' is early morning tea, or <i>chota haziri</i>. 'Tunch' is rather a common meal
in the country, and would be partaken of on coming back late in the afternoon, after a long morning's hunting or bicycling; some 
people call it 'an egg to their tea.' 'Brinner,' on the contrary, can only be eaten by those people whose custom it is to dine 
heavily in the middle of the day. Germans probably find it a favouritemeal. But, of course, 'brunch is undoubtedly far the best 
of them all, and is, indeed, as you remark the 'resource of the indolent.'--I am, &c. M."<br>

<b>Why do we celebrate Mother's Day with restaurant Brunch?</b><br>
<a href="foodfaq7.html#brunch">Brunch</a> gives the entire family the chance to enjoy an elegant, leisurely meal together. Mom presides at 
the head of the table, not in the kitchen. Nor does she have to clean the house for company. Midday meal also give mom

find suggested menus for Mother's Day in standard household cook books.

find for Mothers Day Brunch are newspaper advertisements, circa 1944. These brunches were held in country clubs and
churches. Savvy restauranteurs knew a good opportunity when they saw it. Sample early menu:

Lunch was introduced as a ladies' meal in the 18th century. Definitions and menus evolved through
time. The Industrial Revolution played a key role in establishing this meal as our modern noontime repast. 
<a href="foodpioneer.html#freelunch">Free lunch</a> was served in 19th century American bars and saloons to 
entice mid-day customers. <a href="foodfaq7.html#ploughmans">Ploughman's lunch</a> is British pub fare.

"At the beginning of the sixteenth century in England, dinner, the main meal of the day, used to
begin at 11:00 a.m. Meals tended over time to be eaten later and later in the day: by the eighteenth
century, dinner was eaten at about 3:00 p.m. French <i>dejeuner</i>, like "breakfast." once meant
the first food eaten after waking from a long spent foodless...<i>dejeuner</i> is now used for
"lunch,"... In English, lunch or luncheon (originally also called "nunch" or nuncheon") was in the
first place a snack between meals. Dr. Johnson's <i>Dictionary</i> (1755) said Lunch or
Luncheon was "As much food as one's hand can hold"; he suggests that it derives from "clutch" or
"clunch."...By the early nineteenth century, lunch...had become a sit-down meal at the dining table
in the middle of the day. Upper-class people were eating breakfast earlier, and dinner later, than
they had formerly done. Lunch having displaced the afternoon dinner...and having become a
substantial regular meal with a name of its own...By the late nineteenth century, luncheon had
become a social occasion mainly for elite women; at this time of day their menfolk were busy
seeing to their financial affairs...The corresponding French institution was <i>dejeuner a la
fourchette</i>, the lady-like "fork luncheon." Nowadays, lunch...has returned to its ancient
function as a workday snack."<br>
---<i>Rituals of Dinner</i>, Margaret Visser [Penguin Books:New York] 1991 (p. 158-9)
<p>
"The midday snack was not dignified by a name in the eighteenth century, but the omission was not long permitted. In 1808 Jane 
Austen described to her sister a day she had recently spent at Godmersham" 'The Moores came yesterday in the Curricle betwen one
& two o'clock, and immmediately after the noonshine which succeeded their arrival, a party set off for Buckwell to see the Pond
dragged...' Thsi term is a variant on wht Dr. Jonson called 'nunchin, defined as 'a piece of victuals eaten between meals'. 
Twenty years later, it was called 'lunch' (defined by Johnson as 'as much food as one' hand can hold') that had take over. IN 
1829 the committee of the exclusive Almanack's Club decreed that the correct word was 'lunch': 'luncheon is avoided as 
unsuitable to...polished society'. The lexical uncertainty, and the preoccupation with the politeness of the term, shows that the 
new meal was at first reserved for the upper classes: hardly surprising, since the main meal of the day, dinner, was still at
mid-day for the working classes."<br>

2003(p. 318-319)
<p>
"The prolonged and busy morning meant that there was no real need or accepted hour for lunch, and this meal crept only
gradually into existence during the second half of the nineteenth century; by that time breakfasts had become earlier and dinners 
still later, so that lunch was viewed as a private family affair for mothers and children who needed some nourishment in the middle
of the day, not yet as another social meal to whoch guests could be invited. Afternoon tea in the drawing-room, as we know know it--
tea, with any combination of bread and butter, sandwiches, biscuits and sweet cakes, taken about four or five o'clock--was the latest
 of modern meals to be created, a specifically social function inveneted by the leisured hostesses of the Edwardian
era. However, even if lunch did not officially exist in Jane Austen's lifetime, its origins were already there in the custom of
offering refreshments to morning callers, who by definition would arrive between 11.00am and 3.00pm. Such refreshments could include
cold meats, sandwiches, cake and seasonal or preserved fruits, which taken together could add up to quite a satisfying meal.
If the morning's business were shopping in town rather than calling upon neighbors, pastry-cook shops would provide tarts, 
buns and other confectionery, to be washed down with a glass of whey, at a very modest charge. The coaching inns would also undertake
to provide cold food for travellers breaking their journeys in between the recognised mealtimes. Such an unofficial small meal might
be referred to, especially in the south of England, as a 'nuncheon'-a dialect word, with many variant spellings and pronounced
something like 'noonshine'."<br>
---<i>The Jane Austen Cookbook</i>, Maggie Black & Dierdre Le Faye [Chicago Review Press:Chicago] 1995 (p. 10)
<p>
"...dinner was by far the most significant meal of the day. At one time it had been held around noon, or in the early afternoon, 
but the association of high status with mealtimes led ot a creeping inflation of the dinner hour. My Austen's day, the upper classes
served dinner to their children at about 2:00 or 3:00PM, while the adults ate at 5:00 or 5:00. The result was a long gap in the
middle of the day when no food was served...as the gap between breakfast and dinner widened, with everyone trying to eat later than 
their neighbors, it became more common to have a little something between breakfast and dinner. However, this meal, known variously
as noonshine, nuncheon, or luncheon, did not become standard during Austen's lifetime. Even families who regularly indulged in 
sandwiches, cold meat, or some other light fare around noon, the food was seen as refreshments or a "collation"...rather than
a full meal. It was eaten in the drawing room, which rather deprived it of full mealtime status. It might also be consumed on 
the road at a inn, when travelers were at the mercy of schedules and of inn location. In such circumstances, they ate when they 
had the chance, regardless of time and fashion. "Lunching" was not an English verb until the 1830s and did not become an 
acceptable term among the educated until still later. On occasion, people chose to take their afternoon meal outdoors, in
which case the meal might be referred to as 'cold meat," a "cold collation," or a "picnic," The practice of eating outside
with packed lunches was also known as "gipsying." All members of the party were supposed to contribute something to the 
meal, rather like a potluck dinner today..."<br>

"The Nineteenth Century. The traditional meal pattern began to change during the mid-nineteenth century, due in part of the growth of cities and the shifting 
occupations of American men. The first meal to change was dinner. As towns and cities grew, it became more difficult for workers to return home for dinner at
 midday as the distance between the home and the place of work increased. Workers earning an hourly wage did not have paid lunch breaks, so they tended to 
eat as quickly as possible...Dinner, the most important meal of the day, moved to the evening, wene the family could dine together at a more leisurely pace. The
 midday repast came to be called lunch (shortened from "luncheon") and evolved into small, light, and frequently rushed meal--often something brought from home
 in a tin pail or a brown bag, or a quick bite in a workplace cafeteria. Sandwiches, soups, and salads became common luncheon foods. Although somewhat more
 the masters of their own schedules, professionals, such as doctors, lawyers, and businessmen, rarely had time to return home for a long afternoon meal. So they
 ate larger, hearty breakfasts and big dinners, and skipped lunch or ate something light at work...By the late nineteenth century, the evening meal became the major 
meal of the day; it evolved into an occasion for entertaining. Among the affluent, dinner was served later and the offerings were much more sumptuous then they had 
been." <br>

<b>"Ploughman's Lunch"</b><br>
The "Ploughman's Lunch," as defined by modern British cuisine, presents a modest plate of simple sandwich and pickle or 
small salad. When and where did this practice begin? 
<p>
Interesting question with several possible answers. Food historians confirm laborers (medieval ploughmen, pastoral 
shepherds, copper miners, etc.) typically consumed simple, portable, belly-filling foods at midday. These dinners (the 
practice of calling this midday meal lunch began in the 18th century, but was not widely accepted until the 20th) were 
brought from home. Most often they consisted leftovers from the previous night's supper. Indeed, bread, cheese, salted 
meat and preserved fruit/vegetable (aka pickle) were simple to pack and easy to consume without the aid of utensils. 
Copper miners in Cornwall "lunched" on Cornish pasties for this reason. 
The "Ploughman's Lunch" one finds in British pubs today is a modern twist on this old theme. According this British food 
historian, this *standard* menu option dates to the 1960s. Notes here: 
<p>
"The ploughman's lunch is often taken as an example par excellence of the hijacking and perversion of traditional food. 
What, it is asked, could a ploughman find less satisfying after a back-breaking morning in the fields than an exiguous 
piece of tasteless, unidentifiable cheese, a flaccid roll, a couple of limp lettuce leaves, and a dollop of commercial 
pickle? The ploughman's as it is often abbreviated, began to appear in the pubs of Britian in the late 1960s. It was quick 
to arrange, making it easy for publicans to satisfy the growing demand for pub food more adventurous than a packet of 
crisps, and it had the added advantage for the marketing men of conjuring up a nostalgic vision of a simple hearty country 
food. The basic ingredients--cheese, bread, and pickle--have remained the same, although what a Victorian farm labourer 
would have thought of the pate which is now sometimes substituted for the cheese is nobody's business. What was the 
nineteenth century's idea of what a ploughman had for lunch? The surpised poet swung forth to join them, and an 
improvised sandwich, that looked like a ploughman's luncheon, in his hand.' (J.G. Lockhart, Memoirs of the Life of Sir 
Walter Scott, 1839)."<br>

<p>
Period American cookbooks offer few suggested luncheon menus. Luncheon in the mid 1800s was still considered a fashionable meal practiced by the wealthier classes. Dinner was still the main meal of the day for most folks; often served at noon. This distinction sometimes causes confusion when searching for menus of this era. There are entire books written on dinner menus.

Tiffin was a light midday meal enjoyed by 19th century British families stationed in India. 
<p>
"Tiffin. In colonial India, when the evening dinner beame a heavy daily repast, only a light afternoon meal was necessary. This was called
tiffin, a word which first appears in AD 1807 in Anglo-Indian writing. It meant a light family meal of salads, done-over remnants of the 
meats of the previous day in the form of minces, pies and even curry, fruit fools, jellies and ice-creams. The word tifin itself is a 
coloquial English term, which comes from the word tiffing for eating and drinking out of mealtimes, and the word tiff, which was to eat the midday
meal. The word tiffin has been adopted particularly in the Madras area for a light afternoon snack of items like the uppuma, dosai and vada, to the 
extent that many take it to be an Indian language word."<br>

<p>
"And what of the ubiquitous tiffin, the present late-afternoon snack meal of south India? Originally the word stood for the Anglo-Indian luncheon, and surprisingly its
 origin is not Indian at all. The word derives from both the slang English noun tiffing, for eating or tif, which was to eat the mid-day meal. When dinner became a 
heavy evening meal, only a light snack lunch was customary, which explains why the word tiffin appears only as late as 1807 in Anglo-Indian writings."<br>

<b>What is "dinner?"</b><br>
French, from verb "diner," meaning to dine. First instance of this work in English print is 1297:

now, by the professional and fashionable classes, usually in the evening." <br>

by the demands of
workers whose mealtime was often not paid for by their employers, thereby necessitating a quick,

<b>Sunday dinner?</b><br>
The origin of today's Sunday dinner (defined as a formal family meal held in a family member's house with extended family attending) descends from ancient rituals of 
families (tribes of related people) coming together for social sustenence. The evolution of this meal is complicated and affected by several factors including:<ul>
<li> Religion...Christians traditionally view Sunday as the day of rest and family renewal. 
<li> Social ritual...Agrarian societies commonly shared mid-day dinner as the largest meal of the day. 
<li> Practicality...Cooking a large meal (roast etc.) once a week and feeding off the leftovers was efficient
</ul>

<b>Modern families mourn the demise of traditional Sunday Dinner:</b><br>
"Every near-by road, park and restaurant bears witness to the passing of the old-fashioned Sunday dinner from the neighborhood
of New York. Who, any longer, eats such a Sunday dinner as did every self-respecting family a few decades ago--or less? The meal 
used to be a ritual. The ceremony began with the dropping in, after morning worship, of relatives in black coats and rustling
silks. They gathered in the parlor to discuss every one who was not there until the aromas from the kitchen reminded them of 
Sunday diners of their own. Some, however, always remained for the rolling back of folding doors. Sunday dinner was the weeek's
"company" meal. Among other things there would be chicken and pickles after grandmother's treasured recipe. In Summer there was 
ice cream, home made, most likely, and in such quantities that every one was sure to get enough. But the oncoming generation will
cherish no such memories. The once set repast has become almost anything from a "shore dinner" to a mere snack. Sometimes it is 
dispensed with entirely, a late breakfast and an early supper striving to bridge the gap. The pace of modern life is to blam, and tow
of its major problems are specifically responsible. Servant girls have looked upon the lot of their sisters in factory, office and
shop and rebelled against the seven-days-a-week job. They demand their Sundays off, and get them, letting the brunt of the burden
fall on the housewife. The housewife in her turn revels at the prospect of spending the day of rest in the kitchen; and so she 
bundles the family off, maybe to a restaurant, maybe to a park or a bench refreshment stand, maybe for a picnic in the woods. 
Even were help available for serving a Sunday feast at home, it is not very likely that New York would remain faithful to the old-
fashioned form. The traffic problem prescribes a Sabbath of a new order. Elsewhere one may attend services most properly and make
one's way home to dinner in peace and comfort, all without sacrificing the outing that every automobile owner considers essential
to Sunday; for when dinner is done, ample time remains for a spin on little-crowded country roads. But the New Yorker knows that he
must devote his day to the jaunt. New Yorkers take their lunch baskets with them and gayly speed away; or with less forethought
they keep going until some favorite inn is reached, or one of the Joneses and the Jenkinses have recommended, or one that merely 
catches the eye in passing. Dinner on Sunday, in consequence, has lost its importance. It is no longer Sunday dinner."<br>

<a name="ambigu">
<center><font size="5" color="#003366"><b>Ambigu</b></font></center><br>
In French, the term "ambigu" means ambiguous. In English, this culinary interpretation of this word makes perfect sense. Essentially, a
meal served "Ambigu" presents cold, hot, and dessert courses together on a sideboard. It is an efficient, yet confusing,
entertainment model. Food historians tell us Ambigu was a generous meal enjoyed by the upper classes after formal social gatherings.
Today's <a href="foodfaq7.html#buffets">buffets</a> and <a href="foodfaq7.html#brunch">brunches</a> sometimes emulate this
model. The difference? A classic Ambigu was an offshoot of <a href="restaurants.html#frenchservice">Service A La Francaise</a>. Servants filled the plates of the
guests. Dessert, while present, was not served until the end of the meal. Buffet, as we know it today, is generally a help-yourself-affair with the exception of professionally attended
serving areas. Think: omelette bars and carving stations. 
<p>
The <i>Larousse de la Langue Francaise</i> traces ambigu, as a meal, to 1600: 
"Repas froid or ou l'on servait a la fois le dessert et les autres mets." (1979 edition, p. 66)
<p>
The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> places ambigu on UK tables in the 17th century:
ambigu, n. Etymology: < modern French in same sense: prop. adj. = ambiguous adj.(Show Less) Obs. 
An entertainment at which the viands and dessert are served together; or at which a medley of dishes are set on.

"Ambigu (Cold collation).--<i>Trevoux Dictionary</i> gives the following definition: 'A mixed collation at which meat and fruit are
served together in such a manner as to make one wonder whether it is a simple collation or a supper' In other dictionaries the same 
definitoin, or nearly the same, is given with the proviso that the dishes served at this kind of a meal must be cold. In his 
<i>Dictionnaire Universel de Cuisine</i> Joseph Favre says that the word ambigu is applicable to a meal which is taken between
luncheon and dinner, or between dinner and luncheon, and that which all the dishes, the sweet courses and the dessert are served at
the same time. We think that this definition should apply specifically to the night meal, a supper, served in the course of a soiree

<a name="barbeque">

<center><font size="5" color="#003366"><b>Barbeque</b></font></center><br>

People have been cooking on open fires since the beginning of human history. The meat they

cooked, fuel they used and structures they built depended upon what was available in that place at

that time. The history of  barbeque is connected with European explorers and the New World.

According to the food historians, there are several theories about when & where

barbeque (barbecue, BBQ) began:

<p>

"The word comes from the Spanish "barbacoa," which in turn had probably come from a similar

word in the Arawak language, denoting a structure on which meat could be dried or roasted.

When the word first entered the English language, in the 17th century, it meant a wooden

framework such as could be used for storage or sleeping on, without a culinary context. However,

by the 18th century it took on the first of its present meanings, and--at least in the USA--the

second one too. The third meaning, like the apparatus itself, became commonplace in the latter

part of the 20th century."<br>

---<i>The Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford]
1999 (p. 58)

<p>

"Barbeque (outdoor grill)...An open-air cooking apparatus, usually charcoal burning, for grilling

or spit-roasting meat or fish. Charcoal cookery is the most ancient of cooking methods. The

Barbeque method is of American origin, being associated with the legendary conquest of the

West. It was subsequently adopted in Europe. The word probably comes form the Haitian

"barbacoa," meaning grills, but some attribute its origin to the French "de la barbe a la queue"

(from the beard to the tail), referring to the method of impaling the animal on the roasting spit.

There may even be a connection with the French "barbaque" which comes from the Romanian

 "berbec" meaning roast mutton."<br>

---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, Jenifer Harvey Lang [Crown:New York] 1988 (p. 66)

<p>



"From the Caribbean sources, directly or indirectly, the colonists also discovered how to

barbeque. The northern part of Hispaniola, one of the Spanish Islands, had never been properly

settled, the early pioneers having done little more than ship in come cattle and pigs. These, left to

their own devices, had flourished, so that when ship-wrecked sailors, runaway servants and other

kinds of vagabond began to take refuge on the island, the food supply presented no problems.

From surviving Caribs they learned the old island trick of smoke-drying meat on greenwood

lattices erected over a fire of animal bones and hides. The Caribs called the technique  boucan,'

which passed into French as boucanier and gave the outcasts their name of buccaneers. In Spanish

the greenwood lattice was called  barbacoa,' which intimately became 'barbeque'.<br>

---<i>Food in History</i>, Reay Tannahill [Crown:New York] 1988 (p. 222-223)
<p>
"An Arawak barbacoa was a grating of thin green sticks upon which meat was grilled above and
open fire....The Indians sliced their meat into thin strips, laid it upon the barbacoa and cooked it
slowly, exposing it to the smoke of the wood fire below, which was constantly enhanced with the
fat of the animal. Cooked and cured in this way, meat took on a more interesting flavor than that
obtained by the South American Indians, who cured their meat by drying it in the sun...To cook
meat on a barbacoa was, in the language of the early settlers, to boucan...One of the first men to
report on the Indian methods was Pere Labat, and extraordinary French priest who live in the
Caribbean in the late 1600s..."<br>

<p>

"<i>The Dictionary of American English</i> shows that the word [barbeque] was in used in

America at least by 1655, when it first appeared in print, and by 1733 it had taken on the

implications of a social gathering. By 1836 barbeques were popular in Texas...Regional

distinctions and preferences for various styles have long been part of folkloric debate in

America..."<br>

---<i>The Encyclopedia of American Food</i>, John Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999
(p. 19)
<p>
"Barbecue is a method of slow-cooking meat over coals, also known a barbeque, bar-b-q, BBQ,
or simply  cue....Most authorities agree that both the word "barbecue" and the cooking technique
derive from the Taino and Carib peoples of the Caribbean and South America. The Spanish
conquistadores reported natives of Hispaniola roasting, drying, and smoking meats on a wooden
framework over a bed of coals, called a barbricot, which the Spaniards pronounced barbacoa. The
derivation from the French barge a queue, literally "from beard to tail," has been discounted.
Europeans had of course been cooking meat over fires for thousands of years. It was the low heat
of the coals and the consequent slowness of the process that set the New World method apart.
One Early French explorer reported: "A Caribbee has been known, on returning home from
fishing fatigued and pressed with hunger, to have the patience to wait the roasting of a fish on a
wooden grate fixed two feed above the ground, over a fire, so small as sometimes to require the
whole day to dress it." The Europeans in the New World quickly adopted this novel method of
slow cooking, discovering fairly early that hogs made great barbecue...Barbecue parties featuring
whole hogs became fashionable enough by the late 1600s that Virginia passed a law banning the
discharging of firearms at barbecues...The barbecue as a social occasion has been well
documented...The oldest form of American open pit barbecue is practiced all along the flat coastal
plain of the southeastern United States where the English colonists originally settled."<br>

<b>Barbeque sauce</b><br>
People have been marinating fire-roasted meats with sauces to tenderize and enhance flavor since
ancient times. The primary difference between ancient marinates [vinegars, fermented fish
extracts, soya sauce] and barbeque sauce as we know it today is the <a href="foodsauces.html#tomato">tomato</a> [a new world food].
<p>
We will probably never know who invented the first tomato-based barbeque sauce [and how it
tasted] but we can make educated guesses as to how various recipes evolved based on local
ingredients, cultural preferences and popular demand. A close cousin is ketchup, also made with
tomatoes, vinegar, sugar & spices. <p>
Many Americans take great pride in their region's recipe for BBQ sauce. Most of these sauces
originate from the southern and central regions of our country: Texas, Kansas City, the Carolinas,
Louisana, Arkansas and Memphis. Other regions also produce local sauces, such as Syracuse,
New York.

The practice of raising funds (as well as donating labor & materials) for charitable causes dates back
 to the dawn of civilization. Modern bake sales descend from this venerable tradition. The general purpose of a bake sale 
is an inexpensive way to raise funds for a common cause. Bake sales are hosted by churches, schools, scouts, community 
organizations and library volunteers. 
<p>
The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> (online ed., updated through 2006) traces the first print reference to a bake sale (as a fundraising event) to 1902. This term is used in North America/USA. Earliest references  pop up in local newspapers in the eastern states. By WWI, the term is common. Presumably it was a favorite way of Ladies Aid Societies to raise money for their causes. It is interesting to note that earliest reference are connected to churches. Such was also the case of ice cream socials. 
" bake sale n. orig. N. Amer. a sale of donated (and usually home-made) baked goods, held as a fundraising event.

Several cultures have traditions for serving large numbers of people from a common table laden
with festive food. Ancient and Medieval civilizations banqueted. In the Netherlands it's called 
Rijstaffel, in Sweden it's <a href="foodfaq7.html#smorgasbord">Smorgasbord</a>,  Spain has <a href="foodfaq7.html#tapas">Tapas</a> and Denmark offers Smorrebrod. The
French invented Buffet.
<p>
It is difficult to acertain the exact history of buffet because this word has several meanings 
relating to food:<ul>
<li> A piece of furniture (sideboard) meant for holding before and after service at a formal table. Food is served by waitstaff.
<li> A restaurant showcase of food choices, served by waitstaff. 
<li> A banquet set out on tables separate from the dining table. Diners take what they want. Professionally manned carving stations (also omeletes, crepes &c) 
appear at more formal affairs. 
</ul>
It is not always possible, when reading primary texts, to determine with certainty
how the author is using the word. Food historians tell us the word "buffet" appears first in France,
then England, in the 18th century. <a href="foodfaq7.html#americanbuffet">American-style buffet</a> became popular during the

"Buffet. A term which may either indicate a sort of sideboard (usually for the display of silver or
other tableware or for setting out prepared foods); or tables of food set out for guests to help
themselves; or a meal for which such an arrangement has been made; or refreshment room in a
railway station (buffet de la gare in France); or a railway carriage serving refeshments (buffet
car)."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.

<p>

"At formal medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque dinners, an edifice of shelves known as a "buffet"

was erected to one side of the dining hall; upon it the family silver--which was often far too

valuable to be subjected to the hazards of use--was proudly displayed. Later the food was

displayed there as well, so that guests could have a preview of what they would be eating, rather

as modern restaurants often exhibit dishes of food to tempt their customers. Later still, yet 

another little room led from the dining room, where guests could visit the  buffet. These shelves

for display, like the tables, had often been boards set up (dressers in French) for special

occasions; they are the origin of our  dresser and cup boards...Beginning apparently in the

nineteenth century, a  'buffet' meal used to be laid out, not on the dining-room table but on the

dresser or sideboard...A  buffet dinner now refers mainly to the action of helping oneself to the

food and then carrying it away to eat it elsewhere; guests often stand to eat, or sit down with their

loaded plates on their laps..."<br>

Manners</i>, Margaret Visser [Grove Weidenfeld:New York] 1981 (p. 149)

<p>
According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, the oldest print reference to the word "buffet," as it
relates to a refreshment bar, is 1792:
"1792 Observer 19 Feb 3/3: At two o'clock, the buffets were opened and the company regaled
with a cold
collation." Also: "1810: W Hickey Mem. (1913) I. xi. 129: The buffets, which refreshments were
numerous,
were abundantly supplied with refreshments of every kind."
<p>
"Buffet (Restaurant).--In culinary terminology, the word <i>buffet</i> means a fairly large tiered table, often set at the
entrance to one of the rooms of a restaurant, or which various dishes of meats, poultry, fish, cold weets as well as pastries, are 
arranged in a decorative manner. Fruit in boxes or elegant baskets is also placed on these tables. Buffets of large restaurants, 
always artistically presented, also often have a display of choice vegetables, such as garden peas, French (spring) beans, asparagus, as well as the
best of cultivated mushrooms and, when in season, cepes, morels and truffles. Tempting poultry, game, both ground and winged, fresh 
caviar and a great selection of other choice products are also displayed on the buffet, as well as fish, crustacea and shellfish arranged on 
boards covered with seaweed. The buffet of a large restaurant is, in fact, a show of choice edibles. Large tables, generally tiered, with a 
display of foods of all kinds, set in a ballroom (or near a ballroom) are also called buffets. At these the food is dispensed by a butler and the 
guests come to be served either with refreshments: sandwiches, of cold meats, or pastries, and various drinks: champagne, port, orangeade, lemonade, 
chocolate, bavaroise, etc. or to have <i>consomme</i> served in cups. Buffet of this type are also arranged for wedding lunches. 
At large receptions of the days gone by the buffets used to be magnificent. Those arranged by Careme remain to this day models of this
method of serving food."<br>

<b>American buffet</b><br>
Buffet-style entertaining caught on in America during the Great Depression. At home it required little or no maid service
and enabled the hostess to present a splendid table. Restaurants studied this trend and capitalized on it. 
The <a href="restaurants.html#prixfixe">Prix fixe</a> dining option was not a new concept. Neither was all-you-can-eat. 
Colonial taverns, grand passenger ships, college dining halls and Victorian eating clubs were founded on these principles.  
<p>
What made Depression-era buffet different was that it presented the perfect human fueling option in a time of need. Buffets,
in this scenario, were all about quantity. This gave restauranteurs the wiggle-room they needed to make a profit.
Diners enjoying the challenge of piling high their plates, even when
they could return as many times as they liked, were especially welcome. 
The epitome of the grand American buffet was perfected in <a href="foodfaq7.html#vegasbuffet">Las Vegas</a>. Today's 
<a href="foodfaq7.html#brunch">American Brunch</a> is often served "buffet style."
<p>
<b>Buffet was a popular American party option in the 1930s:</b><br>
"Buffet service is one of the simplest and most delightful ways of entertaining large groups. For
formal occasions, such as wedding breakfasts, formal teas and receptions it is most usual. But it is
equally charming for the informal Sunday breakfast or supper, holiday breakfasts, indoor picnics
and church socials. The general procedure for formal and informal buffet service is the same--the
elaborateness of decoration, the types of foods, the kinds of linen, and the presence or absence of
servants mark the distinction between formality and informality. The buffet table should be as
much of a "picture" as possible. A handsome cloth of damask, lace or embroidery, or runners of
lace or linen are suitable. The floral centerpiece should be truly beautiful and flanked by tall
candles in holders of silver, glass or porcelain. A candelabra may be chosen as the center
decoration, with flowers on either side. Candles are not used, however, before four in the
afternoon. The coffee or tea tray and the punch service are placed at opposite ends of the table.
Plates filled with sandwiches, cakes, little cookies, salted nuts, and if the menu is elaborate, with
salads, or other foods, are arranged down the sides of the table, with the silver and china needed
in their service, laid close by. If the silver is placed in rows, the effect is graceful. Piles of plates
and of small folded napkins should be conveninetly near. Everything should be balanaced to create
an artistic and orderly effect. If guests are numerous, the punch may be served from a separate
table. At a formal affair, waitresses preside at the buffet table and serve the guests. They also
collect the used dishes. If a frozen dessert is provided, it is served from the table, or individually
from the pantry. A frappe or soft ice is usually placed in a bowl. It is served in cups or glasses,
placed on doily-covered plates, and a teaspoon is placed on the plate. Moulds of ice cream are
sliced and served on plates; forks are laid on the side of the plates. The guests stand or sit at a
buffet meal, as convenient--special tables are not provided. The informal buffet table may be gay
with colored linen and simple flowers. The table is set as for formal buffet service with this
exception: decorations and foods are less elaborate, and guests serve themselves informally, or are
served by the hostess or members of the party."<br>

<b>Who launched modern American "all you can eat" buffet?</b><br>
Mr. Herb McDonald, Las Vegas NV, 1946.

"The man who inspired the all-you-can-eat buffet and brought the Beatles to Las Vegas died
Saturday, better known by his
deeds than his name. A visionary who helped mold Las Vegas for more than a half century, Herb
McDonald, 83, was one
of the first publicists on the Strip, founder of the group that brought the National Finals Rodeo to
Las Vegas and an innovator
in professional golf tournaments. "He was the godfather to all of us in publicity and marketing --
he made the footprints that
we follow today," said Jim Seagrave, vice president of marketing and advertising for the
Stardust...McDonald inspired the
buffet in 1946 more out of hunger than genius, he recalled. One night while working late at the El
Rancho Vegas, the first
hotel on what would become the Strip, McDonald brought some cheese and cold cuts from the
kitchen and laid them out on
the bar to make a sandwich. Gamblers walking by said they were hungry, and the buffet was born.

for the development of Las Vegas-area signatures such as the Strip's first all-you-can-eat buffet
and the city's status as a popular convention site...In the early 1950s, McDonald launched an
inexpensive buffet at the El Rancho, a tactic that has since been used to attract patrons at virtually
every hotel-casino in Southern Nevada."<br>

Dessert is a complicated topic because the role/importance of last/sweet course in a meal are
cuisine and time dependent. Some cultures (China, most notably) traditionally prefer fresh fruit
over sweet confections. 
<p>
Who "invented" dessert? No one knows. Food historians tell us the practice of ending a meal with
something sweet probably had something to do with ancient medical ideas regarding digestion.
Many of these ideas continued until the genesis of modern nutrition science (mid 19th century).
Did you know ancient cultures avocated ending the meal with cheese because it was thought to
aid digestion? Culinary evidence confirms peoples of ancient cultures enjoyed sweet treats such as
cakes, cookies, confections, sugared nuts, and dried/candied fruits. These were typically the food
of the wealthy classes. Other people might partake of these treats for special occasions (weddings,
religious festivals). The idea of enjoying a sweet dessert every day by "average people" is a
relatively modern concept.

Food historians caution us that "dessert-type" courses were known by other names in times past.
Ancient Romans consumed  "secundae mensa." Medieval England delighted in  "subtleties."
Elizabethan England feasted on "banquets." 19th century France dined on "dessert" inspired by
Antonin Careme.

<b>Why the word "dessert?"</b><br>
According to the <i>Larousse de la Langue Francaise</i>, the word "desserte" derives from the
French
verb "desservir," meaning to clear the table. The noun "Dessert,"  denoting a sweet served after
the main
meal was cleared, seems to have surfaced in 17th century. By the 18th century dessert was
frequently
referenced in both France and England.
<p>
"Dessert...(de dessevir 2; 1539). 1. Dernier service d'un repas, compose de fromages, fruits,
gateaux, etc.--1. (1692). Fruits, patisserie, etc., qu'on mange a la fin d'un repas; moment ou on
sert ce mets."
"Desservier (lat. deservire, servir avec zele; v. 1050)"<br>
---<i>Larousse de la Langue</i>, direction de Jean Dubois [Librarie Larousse:Paris] 1979
(p. 531)
<p>
The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> (2nd edition) confirms the this information:<br>
"Dessert...[a. F. dessert (Etienne 1539) 'removal of the dishes, dessert', f. desservir to remove
what has
been served, to clear (the table)...<br>
1.a.  A course of fruits, sweetmeats, etc. served after a dinner or supper; 'the last course at an
entertainment'. The oldest reference to the word dessert in the OED was published in 1600: "W.
Vaughn
<i>Direct. Health</i> (1633) ii.ix. 54 Such eating which the French call desert, is unnaturall.
1666. Pepys
<i>Diary</i> 12 July, The dessert coming, with roses upon it, the Duchesse bid him try."...<br>
1.b. "In the United States often used to include pies, puddings, and other sweet dishes...Now also
in British
usage (oldest reference is provided comes from 1789).
<p>
"Desserts. A collective name for sweet dishes considered suitable for the last course of a meal,
including cakes, ice creams, creams, raw and cooked fruit, puddings, pastries, and pies. Cheese
have also be included amongst desserts. In Britain, 'dessert' is sometimes regarded as an elegant
synonym for the words 'pudding', or 'sweet', which are used in the same collective sense. The
word derives from French desservir, meaning to remove the dishes, or clear the table. Originally
'the dessert', singular, denoted a course of fruit and sweetmeats, either placed on the table after
the meal, or served at a separate table; in English, it replaced the word banquet, an older name for
a similar course, during the 18th century. The change in emphasis from the 18th century French 
 dessert' to the 20th century miscellany of sweet  desserts appears to have taken place in North
America. The word had a wider meaning for Americans as early as the end of the 18th century,
whereas this usage was not common in England until the 20th century. Originally, dessert, apart
from providing something sweet to nibble, was designed to impress...A formal dessert in the old
sense is now a rarity. One interesting survival is the Provencal  gros souper' on Christmas Eve,
which finishes with a ritual presentation of  les treize desserts, the 13 desserts, based on local
fruits, nuts, baking, and confectionery...Traditions vary between areas and
families, but there are always 13 items, and they are said to represent Christ and the twelve
apostles."<br>

"Dessert, The last course of a meal. The word comes from desservir (to remove that which has
been served) and consequently means everything offered to guests after the previous dishes and
corresponding serving utensils have been cleared away. In former times at great banquets, dessert,
which was the fifth course of the meal, was often presented in magnificent style. Large set pieces
fashioned in pastry, described often and in great detail by Careme, whose accounts are
accompanied by splendid illustrations, were placed on the table at the beginning of a meal...It was
not until about 1850 that the word  dessert took on its present meaning. In ancient times, meals
generally ended with fresh or dried fruit, milk or cheese dishes, often served between meat
courses, consisted of jellies, flans, blancmanges, tarts, compotes, nieules (flat round cakes),
fouaces (fancy pastry), echaudes (poached pastry), waffles and various other small cakes, The
dessert proper consisted of the issue, a glass of hippocras served with oubiles (wafers), followed
by boutehors (dragees with spice and crystallized fruit). In the 17th century, desserts had become
more elaborate and were decorated with flowers. They included marzipan, nougat, pyramids of
fruit, dry and liquid preserves, biscuits..., creams, sugar sweets...sweet almonds in sugar and
orange-flower water, green walnuts, pistachios, and marrons glaces. At the end of the century, ice
creams made their appearance, and at the same time patisserie became extremely diversified, with
different basic mixtures, such as puff pastry, sponge, choux pastry and meringue. In the 20th
century, dessert in France evolved to include cheese and fresh fruit as well as sweet dishes.
However, the term is usually take to mean the sweet course of the meal, whether it is served
before or after the cheese course. The contemporary dessert may include one of a wider range
of dishes, from elaborate gateaux and pastries to simple fruit dishes at a dinner party..."<br>

<center><font size="5" color="#003366"><b>Pot luck</b></font></center><br>

The term "potluck" has two meanings; both practices are related and have ancient roots:<br>
1. Taking one's chances with what is being served (in the cooking pot)<br>
---Travelers and other unexpected guests took their chances (luck!) with whatever was being
served that
night.<br>
2. Community meal composed of food contributions. <br>
---Early societies often pooled food resources for special occasions (weddings, funerals, etc.)
<p>
The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> traces the term "potluck" in print to the 16th century:<br>
"Potluck. One's luck or chance as to what may be in the pot, i.e. cooked for a meal: used in
reference to a
person accepting another's hospitality at a meal without any special preparation having been
made for
him; chiefly in phr. to take pot-luck. 1592 Nash Four Lett. Confut. Ded., "That that pure sanguine
complexion of yours may never be famisht with pot luck."
<p>
"Take potluck. To take what is offered to you...Unannounced guests who show up at a friend's
home at
dinnertime are likely to be invited to stay for dinner by are reminded that they will have to take
potluck, i.e.,
to eat whatever the family is eating. This notion of the luck of the pot goes back to Elizabethan
times [as
evidenced by OED definition above], then an unnanounced guest was invited to share potluck,
i.e., the
contents of the large cast-iron pot on the hearth, with the rest of the family...This take
-your-chances-notion
of potluck has developed in modern times into a more general meaning of to take potluck, i.e., to
take
whatever comes your way-whatever is available at that particular time and place...The surprise-me
aspect
of potluck has increased with the invention of the potluck supper (late 19th century), to which
each invitee
is expected to bring a "dish to pass" or a "dish to share"...Such meals are popular at churches,
schools, and
fund-raisers because they capitalize on individual specialties and minimize individual costs. In
some parts of
the country a potluck supper is called a covered-dish supper."<br>
---<i>Food: A Dictionary of Literal and Nonliteral Terms</i>, Robert A. Palmatier [Greenwood
Press:Westport] 2000 (p. 357)
<p>
"Group meals often involve the contribution of food by the guests themselves: the banqueters are
in these cases both hosts and guests. The phrase "pot luck" was originally used when inviting
someone to a very informal family dinner, on the spur of the moment. The visitor was to expect
nothing specially prepared, but only what the family would have eaten in any case that day. The
guest's "luck" lay in what day he or she happened to arrive, and what meal had been prepared for
the family. The phrase changed ints meaning with the increasing popularity of meals or parties
where the guests come with contributions of food: the "luck" now lies in the uncertaintly about
what everyone will bring. The host can suggest what might be needed, but cannot control the
quality of the offering. "Pot luck" dinners in this sense have an ancient history, and exist in some
form in most societies on earth. They usually celebrate the intimacy of the guests, or at least the
hope that they have a great deal in comon. The host's authority is considerably reduced by means
of the arrangement, but the fact remains that the party has to be held somewhere, and the host or
hosts remain responsible for the venue, the guest list, even for the possibility of gate-crashers. The
success or failure of the party still depends mostly on the "givers" of it. Being expected both to
sustain loss of authority, and to retain responsibility, is a peculiarly modern predicament. But the
informality gained is so important to some that we are prepared to pay the price; and enough honour
still attaches to having the premises, being able to pay for a party (even if the guests help and
must accept the blame for the food provided), and to knowing the "right" people to ask, that
hosts continue to shoulder the burden and risk of inviting people for "pot luck."<br>

Early 19th century American references to "pot luck" affirm the term meant
taking one's chances at another's table. In the last quarter of this century, the contemporary American definition of "pot luck" emerges: participating guests
contributing dishes for a common table. The meal described below qualifies as a 'society' event. Of course, more common (less newsworthy)
meals most likely were enjoyed as well. In churches, community centers, schools, political gatherings, &c.

"The Pot-Luck Picnic...An Impromptu and Enjoyable Dinner--A Display of Culinary Skill. Last evening, at the 
Free Trade Club, a dinner was given by Hon. Robert R. Roosevelt to a large number of his friends. Though invitations had been 
issued for a week previous, the feast was decidedly of an 
impromptu character as far the viands went. The origin of the dinner was something of this kind: The host having met several; ladies
and gentlemen who declared that they were learned in the art of de la gueule, Mr. Roosevelt challenged them to make a display 
of their culinary ability. The wager was taken up at once, and hence the the dinner. Cards of invitation of an amusing character were 
issued, on which the menu was indicated, with the names of the improvised cooks who were to concoct gumbo, lobster cutlets, 
plumb pudding, various salads, and coffee. About 50 guests were present...Course followed course in a tumultuous way. Culinary 
inspirations and cookery nocturnes of all flavors and tastes crowded one another. Anything like system was discarded, and this was

<center><font size="5" color="#003366"><b>Soul food</b></font></center><br>
"Soul food" is a culinary movement, not a dictionary term. Many traditional recipes and
ingredients descended from <a href="foodpioneer.html#slavefood">earlier times</a>. While there
is some general concensus
regarding the "core list" of ingredients/recipes considered soul food, there are many subtle
nuances and culinary diversions. The term "Soul food," as it relates to cuisine, entered the "scene"
of food history in the 1960s. Some notes here:
<p>
"The expression "soul food" is a term grafted from the expression "soul music," which in the
1960s referenced black artists noted for their soulful blues and rhythmic music. The term "soul"
was applied also to artists noted for their culinary skills, particularly to field-hand cooks in
antebellum America, who performed culinary miracles with foods then thought to be too common
for the master's table. These included the South's cheapest staples, such as black-eyed peas, yams
or sweet potatoes, collard greens, dandelion greens, turnip greens, chitterllings (the small
intestines of hogs), how maws (the stomach of the hog), ham hocks, trotter (the feet of the hog),
hog jowl (the cheek of the hog), cornbread, and so on. The numerous African American authors
who wrote soul food cookbooks in the 1960s...invariable listed a wide range of foods."<br>

University Press:New York] 2004, Volume 1 (p. 27)<br>

<p>
"Soul Food.<br>
Although this term applies to traditional foods eaten by African -Americans, especially in the
South, it is of rather recent vintage, first in print in 1960, when it became associated with the
growth of ethnic pride in African-American culture, of which food was a significant part. The
term dates in print to 1964 and comes from the faternal spirit among African-Americans that their
culture, heritage, and cooking gives them an essential "soulfulness" that helps define the
African-American experience. Soul food dishes include chitterlings, blackeyed peas, collard
greens, hominy, grits, ham hocks, and more. As Bog Jeffries, in his <i>Soul Food Cookbook</i>
[1969]
notes "While all soul food is southern food, not all southern food is soul."<br>

terms

chitterlings, collard greens, ham hocks, grits, black-eyed peas and rice, and the like."]
<p>
"Soul Food, early 1960s, being the "down home" food associated with poor southern Blacks,
Black ethnic dishes often stem from slavery days when slaves were given the cheapest southern
staples and the food parts discarded by the plantation owners, to which they added greens they
had grown themselves or picked wild--and a touch of African cooking. it includes beet greens,
collard greens, dandelion greens, poke greens, and turnip greens; black-eyed peas (1738, they
were brought by slave traders from Africa to Jamaica in 1674 and from there to the American
colonies), hog maw, hog jowel, trotters, and ham hocks; sweet potato pie, and such ubiquitous
southern favorites as corn bread, fried chicken, and watermelon. The new Black awareness and
pride made soul food something of a fad by the late 1960s and both Blacks and Whites were
talking about the new soul food restaurants."<br>

roots of Negro music for inspiration, a return to field hand chants work songs, funky blues and gospel rhythms in what was a

"History has caught up with Davis Roberts. For years he has cooked the traditional foods of his people. Today, the came foods are 
symbols in a social revolution. Down-home cooking has become soul food. 'Aside from its social connotation, soul food is worthy of
popularity on its own merits-for the simple reason that it tastes good.' said the Alabama-born actor. 'It also turns out to have 
great nutritional value,' he added with a smile. General acceptance of soul food, a term that has been in public use for about three
years, stems from the civil rights movement. Roberts called it 'a kind of affirmation.' 'It's now enyoing a public popularity, but in the 
old days there was always a sort of stigma attached to it as an economy  food. Gumbos, for example, were clean-out-the kitchen dishes.
But now soul food has become a sort of luxury. Some of the ingredients are expensive, and you have to run all over town to find them,'
he said. Soul food, a new term for old dishes, was daily fare in the Southern countryside during Roberts' boyhood in Alabama and 
Tennessee. The simple cookery was based on what was available, on what could be grown on a little plot of land--turnip greens, mustard
greens, collard greens, kale, field peas, corn, sweet potatoes, cabbage, rutabagas, salt pork and ham hocks. 'People could often keep a 
pig when they couldn't keep a cow.' Roberts said. 'Much sould food requires a lot of time because it was cooked by people who had a lot
of time,' he observed. For that reason, the busy actor does not cook it as often as he would like to eat it...One of Roberts' menus,
cooked from childhood memory, consists of collard greens and salt pork, cold beets in vinegar, baked sweet potatoes, buttermilk and 
corn bread. Another consists of smothered pork chops and gravy, succotash 'and the perennial corn bread.' Roberts, how had to grapple
with the problem of converting cooking habits into specific recipes, explained that 'soul food requires the kind of cooking that is
done by taste, by someone who stands there and watches and stirs and tastes.'"<br>

"Even the little restaurants that before simply offered 'home cooking' now carry large signs in their windows advertising
'soul food.' The food itself has not changed: chicken and dumplings, spareribs and ham hocks, greens and yams, cornbread and biscuits. 
The difference is that now these Southern Negro foods are viewed as part of 'our black cuisine.'"<br>

in American texts in the 1930s. British authors, with the exception of Alec Waugh's <a href="../foodtimeline.org/1924.pdf">

<b>James Beard's suggestions for hosting a successful cocktail party transcends time:</b><br>
"The most important key to the success of a cocktail party is the attitude of the hosts. Things should be arranged so that there are no worries on the guests' arrival,
 and no misgivings about the amount of food in the refrigerator or the amount of liquor in the cellar. True hospitality means that the host is giving his undivided 
attention to his guests and enjoying the party. No one can feel at home with a worried host. So keep up a steady happy attitude no matter what happens and if there 
are worried, keep them in the back of your head and don't give them away to anyone else."<br>

<b>Super Bowl I [1967] </b><br>
The first Super Bowl converged in the Los Angeles Coliseum, January 15, 1967. Kansas City Chiefs vs. Green Bay Packers. 
Packers won (35-10). The <i>Los
Angeles Times</i> documented what is arguably the "first" Super Bowl party. It took place in Mexico.
"Pepsi Cola biggie Samuel Dresch and Mrs. Dresch flew into town with two private planes full of friends for the Super Bowl 
Game. They entertained later in Perino's private dining room with a dinner party."<br>
---"Snow and Ski Devotees Take a Powder to Mexico," Christy Fox, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, January 16, 1967 (p. D9)<br>
 [Perino's is on Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles.]
<p>
<b>What do Americans eat during the Superbowl?</b><br>
Most fans start with items representing the competing 
teams: sourdough bread for the 49'ers, crab cakes for the Ravens,
Clam chowder (Manhattan for Giants vs New England for Patriots), Buffalo Wings for the Bills, Cheese platters for Green Bay, 
Deep Dish Pizza for the Bears, Kansas Style ribs for the Chiefs, Horseshoe sandwiches for 
the Colts, Cheese steaks for the Eagles, Po'boys for the Saints &c.
<p>
After that,
the menu is mostly composed of man cave finger foods: easily consumed, plate optional, washed down with beer in mass quantities. This 
meal is consumed on coffee tables in TV rooms. The television (the larger the better) is the focal point; not the table. 
No place for fussy salads and complicated desserts. Women's magazines sometimes offer festive ideas for dressing up "your man's"
party. Fuggetaboutit. Another phenomenon: this is one American holiday where catering/delivery is not only okay, it's recommended.
<p>
<b>[1998]</b><br>
     "In fact, many observers say, Super Bowl Sunday has become one of America's
     biggest binge days. In terms of food consumption it ranks third, behind only
     Thanksgiving and Christmas, according to research by Hallmark Cards. "The
     event has become much more than a football game - it's a party phenomenon,"
     said Hallmark spokeswoman Kathi Mishek. She noted that the greeting card
     concern sells as many party goods for the Super Bowl as it does for the Fourth of
     July. The Super Bowl party is a tradition that's grown in part because of the
     proliferation of large-screen TVs, marketing efforts of food retailers and
     producers and the desire to keep festivities of the not-so-long-ago holidays going.
     Americans want to linger a little longer in the holiday mood, said Lawrence
     Wenner, a professor of communications at San Francisco University, who has
     written extensively on the Super Bowl. "There's a big void in the first part of the
     year, when there are no festive holidays." Super Bowl Sunday has "become, what
     you might call, a cultural high holy day," he added. "I guess it's the last hurrah of
     the holiday season," Reif confirmed, "the last excuse to overeat."
     Unlike the scene at Christmas and Thanksgiving, Super Bowl party hosts aren't
     necessarily slaving in their kitchens baking hams or roasting turkeys. The menu
     for the day centers on snacks and finger foods, which can be easily eaten in front
     of the TV set. Often the food is spicy and greasy. Dips, pizza, chili and chicken
     wings figure prominently. "It's guy food," said Sandra Oliver, editor of Food
     History News, a newsletter she publishes in Isleboro, Maine. "Guys eat spicy
     things, like Buffalo wings. We're not talking refined."
     
     "It's a culinary celebration of uncertain traditions," Michael Weiss posted on the
     Claritas Corp. Demographic Detective Internet home page. Claritas, which gathers
     demographic data, found that Super Bowl parties are "associated with a mixed
     grill of finger foods with imported pretensions: salsa and corn chips, brie and pita,
     mozzarella and bruschetta, heat-and-serve pizza rolls and platters of elaborately
     rolled deli meats." For many party givers, this feeding frenzy demands takeout
     food, rather than home cooking.
     
     "It's our single biggest day, believe it or not," said Jim King, owner of Kitchen
     Kabaret, an East Hills caterer, echoing the sentiments of many in his business.
     King supplies fare that ranges from chicken wings to antipastos and crudites to
     filet mignon.
     Other popular takeout items with caterers on Long Island include oversized hero
     sandwiches, deli-meat platters, taco salads and football-shaped cakes. "This is the
     one day people don't go out," said Ronnie Dragoon, owner of the Ben's Kosher
     Delicatessen chain. "They stay at home, turn on the TV, and invite over friends
     and neighbors." It's also the biggest day for consuming snack foods, among them
     potato chips, pretzels and nachos, according to the Washington-based Snack Food
     Association, which estimated that Americans consumed 10.8 million pounds of
     potato chips on Super Bowl Sunday last year. Marketing gets a lot of the credit for
     whetting our appetite to party on during the Super Bowl. It's helped, Wenner said,
     by the two-week period between the conference championships and the big game.
     "The hype level got bigger and bigger," he noted. Food historian Oliver said the
     marketing machines of Madison Avenue are working hard. "Take a look at
     January," she said. "Generally speaking, grocery stores don't have white sales.
     There's really nothing in the month to hang promotions on." Another factor:
     Women moving out of the kitchen into the living room. Over the past 18 years,
     the percentage of women watching the Super Bowl has increased, according to
     Hallmark. Today, nearly 50 million, or 44 percent, of all Super Bowl viewers are
     women, said Hallmark's Mishek.
     On top of that, there's also been a proliferation of large-screen TVs, such as the
     one owned by the Reifs. "You can get more people into your living room,"
     Wenner noted."<br>

<a name="tailgating">
<center><font size="5" color="#003366"><b>Tailgate parties</b></font></center><br>

Humans have been gathering in large groups to witness competitions from ancient times forward. Military encounters, sporting events, theatrical performances
and political rallies all draw crowds. Sooner or later crowds get hungry. Then, as today, spectators brought their own food or puchased from <a href="restaurants.html#fastfood">on-site 
vendors</a>. Some arrived hours or days before the event in order to get the best seats. They laid picnics and cooked with portable messing units. Tailgating happened.
<p>
Tailgating, as we Americans know it today, is a beloved institution. It's the perfect convergence of our competitive spirit and zest for outdoor adventure. In the olden days we tailgated 
from our Conestoga wagons. In the early
20th century new car owners raced off to enjoy <a href="foodpicnics.html#autopicnics">
motor picnics</a>. In the mid 20th century we built
family-oriented camping facilities, inevitably resulting in friendly outdoor culinary (sometimes competitive) exchanges. In all scenarios, some
folks were fine with roughing it while others insisted on dragging civilization along for the ride. Where else but America can fine linen, pate and champagne neighbor nicely with
paper plates, bratwurst and beer?
<p>
<b>Why call it tailgating?</b><br>
James Beard said it best: "For a Tailgate picnic you need a station wagon, for this is simply a picnic that
utilizes the spacious rear flap as the buffet table. Drive to the prettiest spot you can find, unload your grill and serve a delightful
tailgate buffet."---<i>James Beard's Treasury of Outdoor Cooking</i>, James Beard [Golden Press:New York] 1960 (p. 220)<br>
[NOTE: Mr. Beard's "Tailgate picnic for four" menu features Chicken and Rice Paella, Crisp Green Salad, Blue Cheese, French
Bread & Beer.]
<p>
Historians generally agree college football fans were the first to embrace the tailgating ritual. Some
football historians state spectators feasted on picnics before witnessing the first intercollegiate football game (Princeton vs. Rutgers, 1869). Others credit Yale for 
hosting the first American tailgate party during the Great Depression: "Since it got going at the Yale Bowl more than a half
century ago, the pre-game parking-lot picnic known as tailgating has become an almost universal tradition on football 
Saturdays."---"Tailgating in Style," Robert McG. Thomas Jr., <i>New York Times</i>, September 16, 1985 (p. C2). Our survey of newspaper articles confirms
 "parking lot picnics," (renamed "tailgating" in the 1950s when sales of oversized station wagons soared) as a pre-event on-site social 
feeding option, first surfaced in the mid 1930s. Yale's tradition is well documented.
?<p>
Large spectator events today regularly contribute to the national tailgate party. Each offers a unique buffet based on place and taste.  "Old fashioned" station wagons have been replaced by SUVs, pick-ups, vans, RVs and 
mini-coopers. Tailgating has morphed from ivy league social  to a competition event in its own right. For some people, the pre-game party
 IS the main event.
Like American Thanksgiving, tailgating is all about  food, fraternity, and taking a break from daily routine to taste the passion of national pride. Go Bills!!!

<b>A selected chronology of modern American tailgate parties</b>
<p>
<b>[1934]</b><br>
"It was impossible to feed this throng, so field kitchens, set up at strategic corners of the fields in back of the campus, 
dispensed the American sporting lunch, hot dogs and hamburgers and coffee. All over the lawns basket parties sat in picnic fashion..."<br>
---"53,000 See Yale Score Stirring Football Upset by Halting Princeton, 7-0," Robert F. Kelley, <i>New York Times</i>,
November 18, 1934 (p. S1)<br>
[NOTE:Norman L. Macht, in his book Football's Last Iron Men 1934, Yale vs. Princeton, and One Stunning Upset 
draws this conclusion: "The lawns with picnic basket parties, the equivalent of today's tailgate parties." (p. 3)]
<p>
<b>[1935]</b><br>
"No visitors are allowed to picnic in the Yale Bowl."<br>
---"Sorts of the Times, John Kieran, <i>New York Times</i>, November 30, 1935 (p. 10)<br>
[NOTE: Presumably, this explains why the picnics were consumed in the parking lot.]
<p>
<b>[1955]</b><br>
"'Games are social affairs. People bring picnic baskets and eat at parking lots. They exchange social pleasantries, then go in 
Yale Bowl and watch the game.'"<br>
---"Traveleing Olivars," Jean Hoffman, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, September 7, 1955 (p. C4)
<p>
<b>[1959]</b><br>
"Tailgate party is the name for picnics off the rear end of the family station wagon."<br>
---"Household Hints," <i>Delta Democrat</i> [Greenville MS] September 15, 1959 (p. 3)
<p>
<b>[1961]</b><br>
"The parking lot cookout--or tailgate party--is picking up where the backyard barbecue left off. This new American dining custom
occurs in parking lots near football stadiums in many college towns on Saturdays. For a tailgate party you need a station wagon, food, ice,
cool martinis, people and a lot of unexpected happenings bordering on the hectic. The latter is what makes the tailgate party a kiss
n'cousin of the backyard barbecue. Theoretically, friends meet, the tailgate is lowered, the food is spread and the football fans quietly
down a simple lunch before the game. Not long ago, the tailgate party was exclusively a ritual in Ivy League circles. But it
has spread. Our family tailgated recently at that citadel of rigid discipline, the U.S. Military Academy--West Point. If the
superintendent had known we were coming he would have locked the gate. Events just cannot move with military precision at a tailgate
party. The modus operandi in tailgate circles involves planning ahead to meet your less fortunate friends who must arrive in an 
ordinary car. The idea: Share your tailgate. The trick: Find your friends and have them find you so you can eat before the
game. Some folks really make an affair of a tailgate party--bringing a big pot of spaghetti, a roast, or barbecued chicken
for all. The ultimate in tailgate party occurred one recent Saturday before a Princeton game, The host arrived early in a station
wagon with a kitchenette inside. HE made a stew before the game!"<br>
---"From One Woman to Another," <i>Bedford Gazette</i> [Bedford PA], November 10, 1961 (p. 4)
<p>
<b>[1967]</b><br>
"Tailgate mania
...has led to an unusual display of culinary art in collegiate parking lots nationwide. One sample: At West Point home games,
a lady arrives in a chaffeur-driven limousine. Said driver switches to a white coat. With all due ceremony, he puts up table, arranges
arranges comfy chairs, and proceeds to serve a feast complete with wine poured into cut glass goblets. Some tailgaters embellish
tables with floral decorations and lighted candles. Others please the palate while portable stereo tickles eardrums..."<br>
---"A Tailgater's Life Can Be Hectic," <i>Lowell Sun</i> [Lowell MA] October 10, 1967 (p. 12)
<p>
<b>[1971]</b><br>
"Tailgating is strictly American and it's part of that Saturday madness known as the college football season. It's also part of the U.S.
food picture. To the uninitiated, tailgating is the practice of eating...and and also drinking...from the rear end of a station
wagon, a camper or some other kind of vehicle, usually in the parking lot of a football stadium on a Saturday afternoon before a game. The
tailgating fans arrive early to get choice parking spots and out comes the food...and drinks. It seems the bigger the 
stadium, the more the tailgating because the bigger the crowd the more the hot dog without, waiting in line for and endless
period. Tailgating apparently had its origin in New England. That's where I first encountered this fascinating American tradition
and it brings back fond memories. It was on our wedding trip 17 years ago [1954] and three children ago when I subjected my
bride of two days to attending a football game at Michie Stadium at West Point, N.Y. when the Cadets played Dartmouth...on 
that beautiful Saturday afternoon...there were hundreds of fans eating in the parking lot near the banks of the Hudson before
the game...Now the most popular type of tailgating is to obtain chicken, potato salad and baked beans from any of the many chicken
franchise spots...Others prepare lunches of the popular schoolboy type of bologna, pickle loaf or ham sandwiches plus the fan's
favorite home made side dishes like macaroni salad and baked beans. As a rule the fans prepare just what they would for a summer
picnic and generally several carloads of football and food enthusiasts get together to plan the menu and enjoy the feast
together. We've seen fans using hibachi grills to prepare their own hot dogs, minute steaks and the like. We've seen pecan pies and
other goodies emerge from the rear end of a station wagon as the topping for a tailgating adventure. And many come with large 
quantities of eight-packs and also the ingredients for other liquid refreshments. It seems to be a particularly popular
practice at homecoming games when fans come from great distances to see the football team of their alma mater and to meet
school friends from other areas. There's a great fellowship in a tailgating party...and it's even economical because of the
price of hot dogs at most stadiums....Time normally spent in waiting in line for food can be used to enjoy good food and to greet
old friends."<br>
---"1-2-3 Hike! It's Tailgating Time," <i>Journal-News</i> [Hamilton OH], September 23, 1971 (p. 30)
<p>
<b>[1974]</b><br>
"In parking lots near the football stadiums Saturday afternoons all kinds of cheerful sounds ring out during the pregame time. 
Sunday afternoons, too. The tailgate party and picnic season...now a fixture each fall, takes lace among fans of the college, high
school, sandlot and pro teams. Victuals range from the simple--brown bag containing bottle of beer or soda and sandwich--to the really
splendid: champagne, French bread, whole cold chicken, cheese, nuts, fruits. Some tailgate parties or picnics are complicated
but fun. Sample: cooking on the site a spaghetti dinner, using a portable kitchen set up in a camper. The more elegant 
tailgate affairs include tables, usually card tables, spread with real tablecloth. A bowl of flowers suits such an al fresco eating
and dining ritual. Tailgating takes its name from the use of a station wagon's tailgate. The popularity of tailgate parties
on autumn days has increased through the years. With today's high food prices, sandwiches and a mug of beer would seem to be the
best fare. But an elegant feast need not require the hosts to take out a second mortgage. For example, a $5 per person spread
might include: whole cold chicken, assorted fruits, cheeses and nuts, fresh French bread and champagne. Another tailgate party
tip: pack the picnic-lightening way...For the neatest tailgate party of all, aim for a finger-food menu...Leftovers? After
the game is over avoid inching along in traffic jams. A post-game tailgate party gets you out of traffic jams and makes leftovers
disappear. PS. --Don't be afraid to make your tailgate feast overly splendid. Anything absolutely anything goes. I have seen lighted
candles in sterling silver holders on folding tables with linen cloths in stadium parking lots. Black tie, anyone?"<br>
---"Football Tailgate Parties," <i>The Times</i> [San Mateo, CA] September 25, 1974 (p. 12)
<p>
<b>[1975]</b><br>
"Roy Lilley watched fans gather for the Louisiana State-Kentucky football game with he benevolent air of a man who started it
all. Modest house trailers, recreational vehicles, campers--every manner of modern mobile living--maneuvered into parking spaces
under the prideful Lilley gaze...'We were the first ones,' he said...'The Lilley Pad,' one of a hundred or so mobile homes
lined up in a huge lot 400 yards from LSU's Tiger Stadium. 'We were the first ones to bring a camper to an LSU football game.'
His wife, Marge, said, 'That was back in 1964.' He pushed his glasses higher on his nose. 'We were the only ones that year. Then,
in 1965, there were three and in 1966 there were 11. After that it just sort of mushroomed.' The Lilleys typify the new breed of
football fan, who no longer is satisfied with open-air tailgate parties in the family station wagon. Nor does he want to battle
traffic, reserving motel rooms far off campus months ahead or standing in the drizzle or snow while quaffing a pregame 
stimulator...Across the country, from Florida to California,...these affluent thousands gather on autumn weekends for college
and professional football games. It is hard to tell if the games come with parties of the parties come with games. The traditional
tailgate party is not dead. Rather it waxes with imagination that would have boggled the early Ivy league tailgaters in their
Stutz Bearcats and front-drive Cords."<br>

<b>[1980]</b><br>
"For some people, the best part of the football season is tailgating...those festive picnics that take place in stadium 
parking lots before football games. Amid tall the excitement of a college or pro game, tailgating has become a tradition in
many areas across the country. People even have at-home tailgate parties before watching a game on TV."<br>
---"A Mexicali Tailgate Party," <i>New Pittsburgh Courier</i>, November 8, 1980 (p. 16)
<p>
<b>[1983]</b><br>
"The gastronomic tradition associated with tailgating has undergone many changes as the vehicles from which they are held. A
generation ago, typical tailgaters lumbered onto grassy parking fields in cavernous station wagons with growling V-8 engines, a
surfiet of passenger space and wide rear doors. Vegetable soup in squat thermoses, ham and Swiss on rye, chocolate brownies, and 
Scotch and soda--or slight variations on that theme--were standard fare. Today's tailgaters are likely to putter to the game in a 
lunch-box-sized import from which unfortunate back east revelers emerge to spend the first part of cocktail hour attempting to stand
erect. While the accommodations today are more austere than the big-car era, the food may make up for it. Colorful pasta and grain-based
salads, homemade breads, imported cheeses, cold poached chicken and fish with herb sauces, roast game birds, lobster bisque, fruit
tarts--these and more are showing up at pregame festivities. As a recent outing at the Yale Bowl in New Haven demonstrated, the 
table settings for tailgate picnics seem to be getting as fanciful as the food...tailgate picnics offer more culinary license
than summer picnics. For one, the weather is generally cooler, so one can consider mayonnaise-based dishes that may present problems
in hot weather; secondly, all varieties of hot foods are appropriate....Planning a tailgate picnic...is not unlike designing 
football strategy for their down and short yardage" You want just enough flair and unpredictability to keep the other side
guessing, but not so much fancy footwork that you risk a disaster."<br>
---"Tailgate Feasts," Bryan Miller, <i>New York Times</i>, October 23, 1983 (p. SM26)
<p>
<b>[2003]</b><br>
"There is little fast food among die-hard tailgaters. For some fans, the time spent cooking is
half the fun. At Louisiana State University, some fans show up 48 hours before kickoff to start tailgating..."<br>
