<b>What is sauce?</B><br>
Food historians tell us sauces were "invented" for many reasons. The three primary reasons
are:<br>
1. Cooking medium<br>
2. Meat tenderizer<br>
3. Flavor enhancer
<p>
Sauce ingredients, compostion, and preparation methods vary according to culture, cuisine and
time period. The history of modern French sauces begins with Francois La Varenne. The French
concept of <a href="foodsauces.html#mother">"Mother Sauces"</a> is an 18th century invention. Classification
ensued. Careme is
credited for this.

<b> First sauces?</b><br>
Sauce has many defintions & uses, depending upon time & place. One of the oldest sauce-type references (albeit fuzzy) is Ancient Roman <a href="foodsauces.html#garum">
Garum/Liquamen</a>. Classic French <a href="foodsauces.html#mother">Mother sauces</a> were created in the 17th century (La Varenne)& codified in the 18th/19th (Caremen/Escoffier). 
<p>
"In France, there have alway been sauces, which is to say that the Franks and the Gauls moistened their food with a flavored liquid. These early
sauces, spiced and pungent, sweet and sour, do not, however, qualify as ancestors of what we know today as French sauces. Tather, they--
and the sauces served in France until the beginning of the modern period--were a continuation of Roman and Mediterranean practice. 
Garum, the basic Roman sauce, was made from fermented fish. Typical seasonings were cumin, cardamom, and coriander, as well as honey,perfuem and flower
petals. The Crusades reopened commerce with the East and broadened the palette of exotic spices that French chefs injected into their
sauces. The first French cookbook, the celebrated Viandier of Taillevent (whose real name was Guillaume Tirel), provides ample
proof that the fourteenth century still dotes on Oriental tastes. A typical Taillevent sauce for roasts consisted of mustard, red wine, 
powdered cinnamon, and sugar. Elsewhere, ginger and saffron crop up frequently. On the other hand, we do detect the beginnings of what we sould call
sauce in Taillevent's coulis, broths thickened with cream, butter, and egg yolks, which served as the basis of the soups so popular
at the time. Roux was unknown as a thickening agent, and the most commmon liaison was bread or toast. The next three hundred years, at
least on the evidence of the leading cookbooks that have survived, was a chaos of invention, but few of the extant sauce recipes look like
their modern counterparts. For the first half of the fifteenth century, the best indications of the style and substance of the 
cuisine come from Francois Rabelais, who catalogues the edible 'sacrifices' made by the Gastrolators to their god, Manduco...
They can be assumed to be an accurate rundown of what people ate in the early 1500s. Out of dozens upon dozens of items, only the following
came with a sauce: pates with hot sauce...and lampreys with sauce d'Hippocras (a sort of early vermouth). Perhaps we should
also include among the sauced dishes the pork chops in oignonnade (a puree of onions?), chicken with blanc-mange, mutton shoulder with
capers, loin of veal 'mustardized'...with powdered ginger, and myriad salted fish. in any case, it is clear that the concept of 
serving food with sauce had not taken hold in Rabelais's time, nor was it usual to build a sauce on a base of stock or
coulis...Real change, in the sauce repetory, does not crop up in cookbooks until the following century."<br>

<a name="garum">
<b>Garum & liquamen</b><br>
"Garum (also known as liquamen) was a powerfully pungent condiment used in ancient Greece and Rome. It was made from small fish 
such as sardines, anchovies, red mullet, etc. Which were fermented together with the intestines of larger fish such as tuna, and it was included in a 
wide range of recipes. Its name was derived from a Greek term for a sort of fish, garos." <br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p.138) 
<p>
"Garum... a fermented fish sauce familiar in the Mediterranean world from the fifth century BC to the end of antiquity. Garum is 
frequently mentioned in ancient literature. This evidence is amply supported by finds of amphorae that once contained the prdouct and by excavations
of salteries, from Portugal and Spain to the Crimea, where it was manufactured. Textual evidence ranges from fragments of satyr plays by
Aeschylus and Sophocles...to full-scale recipes supplied in the Byzantine Geoponica...Various fish and parts of fish...were mixed
 with plentiful salt and allowed to stand in the sun for about two months, after which a liquid (whence the alternate Latin name
liquamen) was allowed to flow off. This salty, fishy liquid was garum; the sold residue was allec. Both products had a strong
smell, which no authors praise. The best garum was the same colour as amber Falernian wine...Curiously, very little information is
forthcoming about how garum was used, until, towards the end of the classical period, the recipes of Apicius give an unambiguous answer. 
It was a culinary ingredient, called for in almost every dish, including many sweets. It is possible that garum was also used
 as a table condiment, but the evidence for this is weak."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Aioli</b></font><br>
Aioli is what happens when <a href="foodfaq1.html#garlic">garlic</a> marries
 <a href="foodsauces.html#mayo">mayonnaise</a>. Simple, delicious, tangy & divine. Originally meant to accompany cod, 
this traditional Provencal sauce pairs remarkably well with eggs, meats and starchy vegetables. Aioli piqued mainstream
American palates after World War II. "True" <a href="foodsauces.html#spanishaioli">Spanish/Catalan Allioli</a> is slightly different: it does not 
contain eggs. Historic notes & vintage recipes here:


<p>
"Aioli is one of the classic components of Provencal cuisine. It is essentially a garlic-flavored mayonnaise, made with egg yolks, olive oil, and garlic...The word, 
like the dish itself, is a compound of ail, 'garlic' and oli, the Provencal word for 'oil'."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 2) 
<p>
"Aioli...is in effect a garlic mayonnaise. But it is not just a sauce; it can take the form of Aioli garni which is a whole dish in itself, traditionally served on Christmas 
Eve and incorporating beef or a boiled chicken. Among the times which aioli accompanies are potatoes, beetroot, fish and other seafood, and boiled salt cod. 
It may also be amalgamated with fish stock to make a thinner and pale yellow sauce to be poured over the fish in the famous Provencal dish called Bourride."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2nd edition, 2007 (p. 8) 
<p>
"Among the peoples living around the Mediterranean coasts, the use of garlic dates back to the very beginning of cooking itself. But as Leon Daudet observed, with 
the aioli it attained its peak of perfection, 'the very highest degree of those truly civilized customs and habits that until health with well-being.' So that we need feel no
 astonishment at learning that when the poet Mistral founded a Provencal newspaper (this was in 1891), he called it L'Aioli. The sauce had become a symbol. And 
he wrote of it with justice: 'It concentrates all the warmth, the strength, the sun-loving gaiety of Provence in its essence, but it also has a particular virtue: it keeps flies 
away. Those who don't like it, those whose stomachs rise at the thought of our oil, won't come buzzing around us wasting our time. There'll just be the family.' And
 elsewhere again: 'The ailoi goes slightly to the head, impregnates the body with its warmth, and bathes the soul with its enthusiasm...'...The aoili...is a word formed 
form the dish's two components: garlic (ail) and olive oil (oli in Provencal). This solid sauce is served with fish, with bourride (the fish sauce of Provence), with 
hard-boiled eggs, with salad, with snails...even with meat,...The aioli de morue is eaten more particularly on Fridays in Provence..."<br>

dl (9 fl oz or 1 1/8 U.S. cup) oil allowing it to fall drop by drop to begin with, then faster as a thread as the sauce begins to thicken. The thickening of the sauce
 takes place by turning the pestle vigorously whilst adding the oil. The consistency of the sauce should be adjusted during its making by adding the juice of 1 lemon 
and 1;2 tbs cold water little by little. Note: Should the sauce separate it can be reconstituted by working it into 1 egg yolk as for Mayonnaise."<br>

<b>[1952] <br>
Aoili.</b> A Provencal olive-oil-cum-garlic cold sauce which may be described as a well-seasoned Mayonnaise with more or less pounded garlic. In Provence, 
the Aioli is the name of the dish itself, whether it be cod or vegetables or snails, when served with such a sauce."<br>
---<i>A Concise Encyclopedia of Gastronomy</i>, Andre L. Simon [Harcourt Brace and Company:New York] 1952 (p. 9)
<p> 
"...in Provence, the southern French province as famous for fish as is Maine, the sauce is the garlicky aioli...'Aoili is not at all complicated...it is only a fine 
mayonnaise with garlic seasoning...Aoili is best eaten with boiled fish, boiled potatoes and carrots. The fish which we used in France aren't available here, but I 
would say that your small fresh codfish, haddock or halibut could substitute. But never use fresh water fish with this sauce...First take four garlic clove sections and 
place them in a heavy stone bowl or crock. Crush to a very fine paste with a round, wooden stick or pestle. Now start the mayonnaise by placing in the bowl with 
the garlic, the yolk of one egg and salt and pepper. Stir thoroughly with fork or spoon till well blended. Next take the olive oil and pour it into the mixture drop by 
drop at first, then in a slow trickle, blending all the while. The more oil used...the thicker and more frigid the dressing becomes. When a fork will stand up in the 
middle of the bowl, enough oil has been added (about one cup of oil in all). To add zest to the mayonnaise, gradually pour in one teaspoon of natural wine vinegar
 (never cider vinegar) or lemon juice. The acidity of the vinegar or lemon thins the mixture but it should still be very firm. Should the sauce disintegrate, the disaster 
can be turned into a success with a little patience...You simply start all over again. Pour all of the sauce except two or three tablespoonfuls into a second bowl. To
 the contents of the second bowl slowly add three or four drops of water and when well blended return to the first bowl, adding more oil if necessary for the desired
 consistency.' Note: [this] is the traditional and somewhat old-fashioned was of concocting this mayonnaise. We suggest that the vinegar might be added to the bowl 
at the same time as the egg, salt and pepper. This will eliminate the possibility of the sauce's disintegrating. Also, when the vinegar goes in first, the oil may be added 
a little more rapidly."<br>

 pound adding 1 cup...of oil, little by little, as for mayonnaise. Stir this mixture vigorously. When finished, it should have the appearance of a thick smooth 
mayonnaise. Aoili is served mainly with boiled fish, hot or cold, but can also be served with cold meat, or could be used for seasoning salads and cooked
 vegetables."<br>---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i> [Crown:New York] 1961 (p. 21)

<b>[1961] <br>
Sauce Aioli [Provencal Garlic Mayonnaise] </b><br>
For: Boiled fish, especially cod, bourride (Provencal fish soup), snails, boiled potatoes, green beans, and hard-boiled eggs. This rich, thick mayonnaise with its fine garlic flavor must be made in a fairly traditional way if it is to have its correct taste and consistency. The garlic should be pounded in a mortar until it is mashed into a very smooth paste. You cannot make it successfully in an electric blender because for some unfortunate reason the garlic acquires a raw and bitter taste, and the egg white required for blend-made sauce does not produce the fine, heavy texture that is characteristic of a proper Mediterranean aioli. For about 2 cups 
1 slice--3/8 inch thick-of stale, white homemade-type bread, 3 Tb milk or wine vinegar: Remove crusts and bread bread into a small bowl. Stir in the milk or vinegar and let the bread soak for 5 to 10 minutes into a soft pulp. Twist the bread into a ball in the corner of a towel to extract the liquid. 
A heavy bowl or mortar, A wooden pestle, 4 to 8 cloves mashed garlic: Place the bread and garlic in the bowl and pound with the pestle for at least 5 minutes to mash the garlic and bread into a very, very smooth paste. 
1 egg yolk, 1/4 tsp salt: Pound the egg yolk and salt until the mixture is thick and sticky. 
1 1/2 cups good olive oil, A wire whip, 3 to 4 Tb boiling water or fish stock, 2 to 3 Tb lemon juice. Then, drop by drop, pound and blend in the olive oil. When the 
sauce has thickened into a heavy cream, you may switch form a pestle to a wire whip and add the oil a little bit faster. Thin out the sauce as necessary with drops of 
water or stock, and lemon juice. Sauce should remain quite heavy, so it holds its shape in a spoon. Correct seasoning....Fish Soup Note: If the aioli is to be stirred 
into a fish soup, more egg yolks are used, usually one per person."<br>

Aioli, an emulsified sauce, strongly flavored with garlic (hence the name) is a classic in Provence, particularly in Marseilles. A popular regional dish made of boiled
 salt cod, boiled vegetables (potatoes, carrots, turnips, andso on) molluscs, crustaceans is also called aioli, but the sauce with its pungent odor is used with leftover 
beef, particularly boiled beef. In a mortar or a wooden bowl, pound the garlic with the salt and pepper to an oily consistency. Mix the egg yolks in well and start
 adding the oil very slowly as if making mayonnaise, beating constantly. Add a little lemon juice from time to time. If the sauce starts to curdle, add a few drops of

<a name="spanishaioli">
<b>Spanish [Catalan] Allioli</b><p>
"Allioli (Catalonia) Garlic Mayonnaise<br>
A unique use for garlic was as a base for emulsion condiments and sauces made by pounding the garlic and incorporating olive oil. The 
first apparent mention of anything resembling allioli is in the writings of Pliny (A.D. 23-79), who was the Roman procurator in
Tarragona, on the Catalan coast, for a year and writes that when garlic is 'beaten up in oil and vinegar it swells up in foam
to a surprising size.' There is no doubt in my mind that mayonnaise...was an evolutionary development from allioli. Whtether all of the emulsions
known throughout the Mediterranean are derived from this usurping is less certain. There is a good possibility of serendipitous 
culinary invention. Unlike the ailo of Provence and the aillade of Languedoc, the true Catalan allioli...is made without eggs, using
only garlic, olive oil, and salt. The garlic is placed in a mortar with salt and pounded until completely mashed and smooth. Then
olive oil is slowly drizzled in, almost drop by drop, as the continued pounding incorporates the oil into an emulsion with garlic..."<br>
---<I>A Mediterranean Feast</i>, Clifford A. Wright [William Morrow:New York] 1999 (P. 513)
<p>
"Allioli might be called the Catalan catsup...In one form or another, it can go on or into almost anything--seafood, noodle and rice
dishes, soups, stews, vegetables, snails. It is all but owith grilled meats, especially pork, rabbit, and chicken...
Strictly speaking, the name is the recipe" all (garlic), i (and, oli (oil). The oil, of course is olive oil...Salt...is added, another
given...maybe a few drips of lemon juice or vinegar or a combination of the two...And eggs? Never. 'Allioli made with eggs...isn't allioli at all. It's
just fancy mayonnaise.' The fact that allioli's closest relative, aioli of Povence and the lesser-known aillade of the Languedoc, always
do include eggs--and thus really are 'fancy mayonnaise'--is taken by some Catalans simply as further proof...that the French don't know very much
about food after all. Big talk aside,...the plain truth is that the vast majority of the allioli served in Catalonia and visicnity is made with
eggs, especially in restaurants...The eggless variety is just too difficult to whip up, and too fragile--capable of instantaneous
 and capricious breakdown.
<blockquote>
<b>Allioli Autentic</b> (Authentic Allioli)<br>
Allioli in its purest form is white and shiny, rather like lemon sorbet in appearance. It is very strong in garlic flavor, and
a little goes a long way--except among the garlic-mad, of course. It is, as noted, practically de rigueur in Catalan cooking to accompany grilled
meat and fowl (especially chicken, rabbit, and pork), and is traditional as well with snails and with many kinds of fish and
shellfish. Fishermen are famous for their mastery of its manufacture, in fact, as are rural mothers and grandmothers--while some of the
region's most famous chefs openly admit the can't always get the...thing to work. The tricky part is coaxing an emulsion
to form without eggs or other thickeners, and this takes a lot of practice...<br>
To make 1 1/4 cups<br>
6 cloves garlic (or more to taste), peeled<brt>
1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
1 cup mld extra-virgin olive oil<br>
Cut each clove of garlic in half lengthwise and discard any green pieces, then mince the garlic finely. Scatter salt in the bowl of a
large mortar and add the garlic. Mash the garlic gently with a pestle, mixing it with the salt untl it takes on the consistency of a 
thick paste. Add the olive oil very slowly, a few drops at a time, while stirring the mixture with the pestle, using slow, even
motions and always stirring in the same direction. Continue adding oil until an emulsion forms. Less than a full cup might be sufficient
to obtain this result, in which case do not use the rest, as it will 'break' the emulsion. Serve immediately."<br>
---<i>Catalan Cuisine: Europe's Last Great Culinary Secret</i>, Colman Andrews [Atheneum:New YOrk] 1988 (p. 29-31)<br>
[NOTE: This book also offers recipes for Allioli amb Ous (with eggs), Negat ('drowned'), & amb Fruita (with fruit)]</blockquote>

"New World" (Caribbean/West Indies) versions generally feature Seville (bitter) oranges instead of lemon.  Think:

given the fact early Spanish explorers introduced bitter oranges and they flourished.

<a name="allemande">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Allemande</b></font><br>
Our survey of historic cookbooks confirms Sauce Allemande [Allemand is French for "German."] was known by different names in different times:  
Tournee, German, Almayne, Parisienne, and Blonde. Essentially, it is a 
classic egg enriched creamy white sauce, flavored with mushrooms and sometimes lemon. Earliest iterations were basic roux concoctions, routinely accompanying fowl. As time progressed Allemande morphed into
 a veloute-based more complicated presentation. The Allemande moniker was renamed Parisienne in the early 20th century. This reflected shifting political events

<b>Almayne--Allemande</b><br>
"...Sauce Allemande, or Sauce of Almayne. In old English and in old French cookery there is always a broth of Almayne, but it gives one no idea of what is now 
understood by the Almayne sauce, which is nothing else than Velvet-down thickened with yolks of eggs, say four to a pint, smoothed with a pat of the freshest
 butter, and flavoured with lemon-juice; sometimes also, but not always, with essence of mushrooms. How this sauce got its name is not quite clear; but it is plain 
that, not only have the Hollander and the German long been more or less confounded together as Dutchmen (Deutsch), but also that the sauce Allemande or sauce 
of Almayne is one of the same character as the well-known Dutch sauce or sauce Hollandaise, and is probably an attempt to improve upon it. Now, Dutch sauce 
has a reputation among epicures of being at once the best and the most useful of all the sauces, while at the  same time it has all the simplicity for which Minheer is 
renowned. It is nothing but butter and eggs, with a litttle water. Suddenly, now doubt, it entered into some Frenchman's brain to improve upon this simplicity, and
 refine upon the Dutch. He dismissed the water, and put Velvet-down instead of it, and, finding the result too rich, he reduced the quantity of buttter. Make a note of
 thsi therefore: that Dutch and Almayne suace are but different forms of the same idea. In Dutch or Holland sauce there is good water; in German or Almayne sauce 
there is the finest Velvet-down. Note another point: the Poulette sauce is another form of the same idea. If the Almayne may be described as an attempt to improve
 upon Holland sauce, the Poulette may be described as mock Almayne. In true Holland sauce there is no flour. But mock Almayne, known as Poulette, attempts by 
means of flour to simulate the effects of the Velvet-down introduced into true Almayne."<br>

<b>Allemande--Parisienne</b><br>
"Sauce Allemande (German Sauce). Escoffier included this egg-bound veloute among the mother sauces, because it is the basis of many other sauces. If we were to
 follow him in this decision, it would imply that we would then make up large quantities fo allemande in advance and freeze it...I am also departing form Escoffier's 
counsel in another matter. He tried to supress the name of the sauce because of hostile feeling to Germany. Since the sauce was German in name only, he proposed
 renaming it sauce parisienne or sauce blonde. This culinary ripost to the armies of Bismark and Kaiser Wilhelm II did less even than the Maginot Line to keep the
 Teutonic menace at bay...Allemande...is thickened with egg yolks, but because it has already been thickened with flour at the veloute stage, it can be boiled after 
the yolks are added. They will not scramble; the flour keeps this from happening. It is essential, however, that all ingredients be cold when you start, since gradual
 heating of the yolks is also crucial."<br>

"White Sauces...Egg Yolk and Cream Enrichment</b> [Sauce Parisienne--formerly Sauce Allemande]<br>
Sauces enrigched with egg yolks and cream are among the riches and most velvety in all the French repertoire. Sauce parisienne, or sauce allemand, is the generic
 term, but it invariably goes by another name according to its special flavorings or to the dish it accompanies. The simplest, sauce poulette, has a base of veloute
 flavored with meat or fish, onions and mushrooms. The most famous Sauce normande is a veloute based on white-wine fish stock and the cooking liquors of
 mussels, oysters, shrimps, ecrevisses, and mushrooms. The shellfish sauces such as cardinal, Nantua, and Joinville are shellfish veloutes with special trimings and a 
shellfish butter enrichment beaten in a at the end. As all of these sauces are a basic velote with a final enrichment of egg yolks, cream, and usually butter, if you can 
make you can make one, you can make all. Success in making the egg yolk liaison is but a realization that egg yolks will curdle and turn granular unless they are 
beaten with a bit of cold liquid first, before a hot liquid is gradually incorporated into them so that they are slowly heated. Once this preliminary step has been 
completed, the sauce may be brought to the boil; and because the egg yolks are supported by a flour-based sauce they may boil without danger of curdling. The
 sauce parisienne described in the following reicpe is used with eggs, fish, poultry, hot hors d'oeuvers, and dishes which are to be gratineed. A heavily buttered 
sauce parisienne is used principally for fish poached in white wine."<br>

Food historians tell us the art of reducing cream sauces (aka cream reductions) began in 18th century France. Think: Antonin 
Careme. Some argue modern bechamel was introduced a century earlier by <a href="foodsauces.html#lavarennebechamel">
La Varenne</a>. Our survey of historic
recipes confirms a facinating dichotomy between the "ancienne" formulary and contemporary sauce. The story behind the "invention" of 
bechamel, and <a href="foodsauces.html#bechemeil">its name</a> continues to fuel intelligent discussion.
<p>
<b>Origination stories</b><br>
"Gastronomique literature is filled with tedious  passages and trifling disputes. Bechanel has inspired more than its fair share of this
piffle. People will bargue about whether it was invend by the Marquis Louis de Bechameil; whether the correct spelling should not be bechamelle;
whether the Italian version, balsamella from the Romagna district, is the original of this best-known and easiest mother sauce. 
In such matters prejudice will always rule, for there is no evidence one way of the other. We can only point to the appearance of a sauce called
bechamel during the reign of Louis XIV. And, as so often, this original sauce bore only a slight resemblance to the modern
sauce. While we think of bechamel as an all-purpose white sauce made of scalded milk, roux, and flavorings, Careme made it by enriching
veloute with cream. The modern sauce is also in dispute...Some chefs, we know from early cookbooks, have always flavored their bechamels with
veal; others have not. The difference in tgaste is minor."<br>
---<i>The Saucier's Apprentice</i>, Raymond Sokolov [Alfred A. Knopf:New York] 1976 (p. 161-162)
<p>
Was bechamel sauce (which 
some people would spell bechamelle) really invented by Marquis Louis de Bechameil? Was this financier a gastronome and a gourmet and
was he in any way competent in the culinary art? We do not know this for certain but everything seems to indicate that the bechamel
sauce, being a major sauce, must have been, if not invented, at least perfected by one of the queux de semestre--cooks in the 
six months' service of the royal kitchen. Some dictionaries give quite erroneous definitions of this major sauce. Originally, the bechamel was made
by adding a liberal amount of fresh cream to a thick veloute sauce. Nowadays bechamel is made by pouring boiling milk on white roux (blend
of butter and flour). When a meat bechamel is wanted, a certain amount of lean veal, diced, and simmered in butter with a minced 
onion is added."<br>

<b>17th century/La Varenne connection?</b><br>
Some sources on the Internet credit La Varenne as the first cuisiner to 
write about bechamel. None of them share the original print reference. 
It is true that La Varenne introduced <a href="foodsauces.html#roux">Roux</a> (Russet)
[a white sauce composed of flour and dairy...milk/cream/butter] at that time. Bechamel is more complicated.
<p>
We find no bechamel in <i>La Varenne's
 Cookery</i>/Terence Scully [Prospect Books:UK] 2006 & <i>The French Cook, Englished by I.D.G. 1653</i>, introduced by Philip and Mary
Hyman [Southover Press:East Sussex] 2001. Both confirm La Varenne used. La Varenne's recipe below describes a "white 
sauce" composed of egg yolks and verjuice. The addition of egg yolks
and verjuice (acid component, similar to lemon juice) is strikingly similar to some contemporary bechamel recipes. If this is the
connection the Internet is perpetuating, we respectfully request reconsideration. La Varenne's sauce is so very different 
from recipes published in the 19th century. Recipe evolution is generally slow and methodical. It is unlikely any bechamel
would skip three generations, much less three centuries. That said, there were many editions of La Varenne's book. It is possible
that a later version offered bechamel.

"A bechamel...in the seventeenth century was a very complicated sauce which contained a number
of vegetables and wines as well as old hens and old partridges, and after being strained several
times was finished with reduced cream and cooked in the oven. Not so very long ago, a bechamel
was cooked in the oven with ham, chopped onions coloured in butter and a bouquet garni. It was
turned out and strained through a hair sieve, double cream was added and the sauce was stirred

gentlemen were eligible, and which was in no way like the post is nowadays fulfilled by a maitre d'hotel of a big restaurant. 
The invention of bechamel sauce is attributed to him buy it had, now doubt, been known for a long time under some other name. It is more 
likely, however, to be the invention of a court chef who must have dedicated it to Bechameil as a compliment. The old Duke d'Escars said:

should just coat lightly the garnish for which it is intended; then you remove it from the fire, add to it a piece of butter the 
size of a walnut and a few tablespoons of very thick double cream to make it whiter. Then add a pinch of grated nutmeg, pass it through
a white tammy and keep hot in a bain-marie. Note. In a marginal note Careme says: 'Boil down 2 pints (about 1 litre) of hot milk by 
two-thirds and use instead of cream, if the latter cannot be obtained except the day before it is required, which renders it extremely
liable to have a sourish taste, whereas by using hot milk no such risk can be incurred. When it is possible to obtain good

"Bechamel, Sauce a la</b><br>
The name of one of the basic French sauces and one of the creamiest white sauces. It was named after, and believed to 
have been introduced by, Louis de Bechameil, or Bechamel, Marquis de Nointel, Lord Steward of the Household at the Court of 
Louis XIV. The flour and water, sticky and lumpy horror so often served under this name is a libellous imitation, but it is
not a Bechanel. To make a Bechamel in the old-fashioned and best manner, one should use butter and flour in equal quantities and the best
and creamiset milk, as follows: Melt the butter, but do not allow to sizzle, in a small saucepan over a rather low heat. When the 
butter is melted, add the flour, stirring well into the butter. Have some cold boiled mlk. When the butter and flour mixture begins to bubble
gently, add the cold milk, very little at a time, stiring and beating well until the whole amount of milk has beeend added and the
sauce is thick and creamy. This is the Sauce Bechamelle. It may be used as a basis for other sauces by adding anything called for by the
recipe chosen: mushrooms, chopped parsley, chopped hard-boiled egg, oysters, or what not. If to be served plain, and if a chic sauce be required,
add the beaten yolk of an egg--after removing the pan from the fire--and a little lemon juice."<br>

Food historians tell us we have been "dipping" food since the beginning of time. Dips can be sweet or savory, mild or spicy. Texture
can be thick (hummus), thin (olive oil), creamy (sour cream based) or soupy (salsa).  They are known in
many cultures and cuisines. Party dips, as we Americans know them today, are a twentieth century creation. Flavor are generally
savory; textures run from soupy to creamy. These cold dips are generally served in the hors d'ouvres course or for party buffets.
Most popular dipping items are crackers, chips and bite-sized vegetables. Dips differ from spreads in that the edible
receptacle is dipped into the creamy accompaniement. 
<p>
<b>Spreads & meal placement</b><br>
Spreads tend to be a little thicker and are applied to bread or crackers
with a small, blunt knife designed for this purpose. Think: pate, compound butters and deviled ham. 
Warm dips like <a href="foodfaq1.html#fondue">fondue</a> and
<a href="foodfaq1.html#bagnacauda">bagna cauda</a> are generally served for as main course rather than
starter or hors d'oeuvre.

"Dips, Dunks, & Spreads. It's been said that dips originated in the 1950s with that gloppy blend of sour
cream and dry onion soup mix known as California Dip. Not so. Barbara Kuck, Director of the Culinary
Archives and Museum at Johnson and Wales University in Providence, Rhode Island, presides
over...culinary memorabilia amassed by her father, the late chef Louis Szathmary...Among these papers is
a recipe for <a href="presidents.html#wilsonclamdip">clam and cream cheese dip</a> penciled on a 3 X 5 -inch file card by Mrs. Woodrow Wilson. It is
said to hae been one of the President's favorites. That would push the advent of dips back to the second
decade of this [20th] century...Still, dips did not come into vogue until twenty or twenty-five years later. And
the man who popularized them, I'm convinced, was James Beard. In his very first cookbook (Hors
d'Oeuvre and Canapes, 1940), Beard wrote:  I think it delightful to have large bowls of cheese mixtures
which are of a consistency that permits "dunking." Cream cheese mixed with chopped onions, sour cream,
and perhaps a little green pepper and a great deal of parsley, is always welcome. Roquefort cheese or
Gorgonzola mixed with cream cheese or sour cream, with a flavoring of chopped chives and chopped raw
mushrooms, is another good dunker. Cream cheese, sour cream, and grated fresh horseradish and a few
chopped chives is another delightful addition to this family. You may have your choice of dunkers--potato
chips, pretzels, crackers, Italian bread sticks--any of them.' Dips gained popularity during the 1940s, at
least in some parts of the country."<br>

[Clarkson Potter:New York] 1997 (p. 23)<br>
[NOTES: (1) This book contains summary histories and recipes for several popular American dips. (2) James Beard's quote appears on
page 44 of his book.]
<p>
The 1930s connection made by Ms. Anderson may be explained, in part, by the Great Depression. During
this period many people had to rethink their entertaining style. Many middle class people were maidless
for the first time. Simple solutions to serving traditional meals  filled women's magazines and trendy
cookbooks.
<p>
"The Depression also changed the way many Americans entertained at home. Except for the
upper echelons of society, most families were now maidless, which made grand, formal dinner
parties impossible. Instead, hostesses gave luncheons, teas, and cozy Sunday Night Suppers
around the chafing dish...The Thirties also ushered in an era of women's clubs--whether dedicated
to charitable activities, gardening, or the fine art of bridge--perhaps as a reaction to the
individualistic Twenties, perhaps as a kind of atavistic huddling together against the harsh
realities of the new age."<br>

Our survey of popular American cookbooks confirms the popularity of dips in the 1940s and 1950s. They
also illustrate the evolution of this item from formal appetizer to informal party fare. It is interesting to note
that in these decades, the sauces were called "dunks." The items used to scoop the "dunk" were called 
"dips."

"Dunking Trays.</b><br>
When a sauce is to be served with hors d'oeuvres, hot or cold, a large platter or tray may be used to hold
an assortment of the hors d'oeuvres and a bowl or container of dunking sauce. Each guest helps himself
to the hors d'oeuvres and dips them into the sauce.
<p>
"Suggestions for hot dunking trays<br>
Hors d'Oeuvres: Codfish balls, hot sea-food hors d'oeuvres, tuna-fish cones, cocktail sausages and
frankfurters, corned-beef hash balls.
Sauces: For fish and sea-food hors d'oeuvres serve hot savory cocktail sauce or gourmet cocktail sauce
or tartar sauce; for meat hors d'oeuvres, mustard cream sauce or hot savory cocktail sauce.
Garnish the tray with crisp radish roses, carrot curls, celery curls, stuffed cucumbers, pickle fans, olives.
<p>
"Suggestions for cold dunking trays<br>
Hors d'Oeuvres: Raw oysters arranged on cracked ice, cold cooked shrimp and lobster, raw-vegetable
hors d'oeurvres, chicken rolls, dried-beef balls, gherkins in blankets, lettuce rolls, stuffed cucumbers, roast
beef rolls. 
Sauces: Russian dressing or Thousand Island dressing, gourmet cocktail sauce or standard cocktail
sauce, or tartar sauce...

"Potato-chip scoop tray<br>
Fill a bowl with any soft savory cheese spread or with drained cottage cheese seasoned with salt, pepper
and onion juice. Sprinkle with finely chopped parsley and paprika. Surround with crisp potato chips. The

raw vegetables. Try celery, raw carrot cut in thin strips or very thin long slices curled in ice water, cauliflower broken and
sliced into flowerets, turnips or kohlrabi cut paper-thin, zucchini, cucumber, water cress, asparagus tips, French endive. Don't

<b>Chickpeas</b><br>
"Chickpea...known as gabbanzo in Spanish, ceci in Italian, 'gram' in India, and often as just plain 'pulse' across the globe, the
chickpea (Cicer arietinum) is an ancient pulse that originated in western Asia and was domesticated there some 7,000 years ago. The tan,
hazelnut-sized seeds, with their wrinkled surfaces, nutty flavor, and crisp texture, soon became popular from the Mediterranean to 
India...and today are practically universal. In the Near East, the chickpea is the basic ingredient for hummus and falafel and is frequently 
incorporated in couscous. In India, as the country's most important legume, the chickpea is roasted, boiled, and fried, is made into
flour, and is part of a dhal. In the Mediterranean region, the chickpea features prominently in the 'poor cuisine'--as a staple in the diet of
poor people, as substitute for meat (and sometimes for coffee as well), and an ingredient in the boiled dinner (cocidos) of 
Iberia. Exactly when the chickpea reached Spain and Portugal is unclear--perhaps with the Phoenicians, certainly with the Romans...
From Iberia, chickpeas traveled to the Americas, where they achieved fame in Cuban bean soup and menudo."<br>

 was not grown in India, bu that is incorrect: it had reached India by 2000 BC, the date of the oldest arthaeobotanical finds of chickpea in the
subcontinent. In the classical world chickpeas were wserved among tragemata, variousl eaten greenm, or roasted, or dried or boiled. Chickpea soup

"The chick-pea is so frequently cultivated in Egypt from the earliest times of the Christan era,
that it is supposed to have been also known to the ancient Egyptians. There is no proof to be
found in the drawings or stores of grain in their monuments, but it may be supposed that this pea,
like the bean and the lentil, was considered common or unclean. Reynier thought that the ketsech,
mentioned by Isaiah in the Old Testament was perhaps the chick-pea; but the name is generally
attributed though without certainty, to Nigella sativa or Cicia sativa. As the Arabs have a totally
different name for the chick-pea, omnos, homos, which recurs in the Kabyl language as hammez,
it is not likely that the ketsech of the Jews was the same plant. These details lead me to suspect
that the species was unknown to the ancient Egyptians and to the Hebrews. It was perhaps
introduced among them from Greece or Italy towards the beginning of our era."<br>

becoming very popular in the early  80s, helped in large part by Jo Anne Vachule. She was food

do, the avocado doesn't darken, even if made the day before." <i>Family Circle</i> editors thought so

<a name="espagnole">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Espagnole</b></font><br>
Food historians generally agree Espagnole first surfaced in the 18th century. It was embraced and codified by Careme 
(early 19th century). <a href="foodsauces.html#demiglace">Demi-glace</a> is the essence of espagnole that begins with <a href="foodsauces.html#roux">roux</a>.

<p>
<b>What is Espagnole?</b><br>
"Espagnole. The name given in classical French cuisine to the 'mother sauce' from which are
derived many of the sauces described under brown sauces. The name has nothing to do with
Spain, any more than the counterpart allemande...has anything to do with Germany. It is generally
believed that the terms were chosen because in French eyes Germans are blond and Spaniards are
brown. Some authorities prefer to regard demiglace...as the parent of the group of brown sauces,
and would say that espagnole is the penultimate stage in producing demi-glace. However, what is
certain is that for people outside France as well as inside the term espagnole is widely understood
to mean the basic brown sauce, and indeed one which can be used on its own although it normally
has added flavourings and a new name. The arduous procedure for making an espagnole on
traditionally approved lines is now rarely followed."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
283)
<p>
"The classical French brown sauce starts ot with a long-simmered brown meat stock that goes into the making of an equally long-simmered, 
lightly thickened sauce base called espagnbole. The espagnole is simmered and skimmed for several hours more with additional stock and 
flavorings until it finally develops into the traditional mother of the brown sauces, demi-glace. The may take several days to accomplish, and
the result is splended."<br>

Spanish cuisine) has as its point of departure three preparations that have been cooked beforehand: a roux for thickening, a brown stock made
from beef, veal, vegetables, pork rinds, and so on, and mirepoix...To this is added lean bacon, onions, carrots, thyme, and a
bay leaf. This brown preparation, which requires six hours to be skimmed, deacidified, passes through a sieve and reduced to a gelee, 
serves in turn as the base for a great many common sauces, such as bigarade, bordelaise, bourguignonne, chasseur, etc...When it has reached the
point of absolute perfection, sauce espagnole is called demi-glace, a sauce obtained by addding to it clear brown stock and Madeira. As
for meat glazes, they are stocks simmered down to a consistency that is almost that of honey or resin."<br>

"Espagnole Sauce. </b><br>
The quantities in this recipe are calculated to make 4 quarts of Espagnole Sauce, which will
certainly not be too much when treating of high-class cooking operations. It must be bourne in
mind that Espagnole will keep perfectly good for three or four days; so that, in large
establishments, even double the quantity I indicate may safely be prepared.
<p>
     Butter a stewpan, and put in it 3 sliced onions; upon these place 6 lbs of boned fillet of veal,
and 2 lbs of gravy-beef; moisten with 1 pint of General Stock, or Grand Bouillon, and set it
boiling on a brisk fire; when the Stock is reduced one half, glaze the meat of a bright-brown and
even colour, by simmering gently, and turning it frequently. 
     This process requires particular attention; for, if the glaze be over cooked, and of a
dark-brown colour, the sauce will have an acrid taste, which no amount of sugar added to it
would
rectify.
     When the meat is well glazed, take the stewpan off the fire; cover it, and let it stand five
minutes before adding any more broth,--this will facilitate the dissolving of the glaze; then pour in
6 quarts of General Stock; boil; skim; and add:<p>
1 faggot, 2 carrots, 1/2 oz. Of salt, 1/4 oz. Of mignonnette pepper, 1/4 oz. Of sugar;
Boil, and simmer; and, when the meat is done, take it out, and strain the Stock through a broth
napkin.
     Make a roux in a stewpan, with 14 oz. of clarified butter, and 14 oz. of flour; when this is
cooked, moistened with the Stock; stir over the fire with a wooden spoon till boiling, and simmer
for two hours on the stove corner, with the stewpan only three parts closed; skim, and take off the
fat twice during that time; and the end of the two hours, skim, and free the sauce from fat once
more; strain it through a tammy cloth; and put by for use.
     Observation.--I do not advise adding a hen or any game to this sauce, as is so often
fone,--butcher's meat alone should constitute the basis of Espagnole, which, being intended to add
to
other preparations, any special flavouring given to it, either by poultry or game, would often be
prejudicial."<br>

"Sauce Espagnole. </b><br>
To make 5 litres (8 3/4 pt or 1 3/8 U.S. gal)
<br>
Ingredients:<br>
625 (1 lb 6 oz) brown Roux--using: 285 g (10 oz) clarified butter and 340 g (12 oz) sifted
flour<br>
12 litres (2 5/8 gal or 3 1/4 U.S. gal) brown stock<br>
150 f (5 oz) roughly diced salt belly of pork<br>
250 g (9 oz) roughly diced carrots<br>
150 g. (5 oz) roughly diced onions<br>
2 sprigs thyme<br>
500 g (1 lb 2 oz) tomate puree or 2 kg (4 1.2 lb) fresh tomatoes<br>
2 dl (7 fl oz or 7/8 U.S. cup) white sauce.<br>
Preparation:<br>
1. Place 8 litres (1 3/4 gal or 2/ 1/4 U.S. gal) of the stock in a heavy pan and bring to the boil; add
the Roux, previously softened in the oven. Mix well with a wooden spoon or whisk and bring to
the boil mixing continuously. Draw the pan to the side of the stove and allow to simmer slowly
and evenly.<br>
2. Meanwhile, place the salt pork in a pan and fry to extract the fat, add the vegetables and
flavourings and fry until light brown in colour. Carefully drain off the fat and put the ingredients
into the sauce; deglaze the pan with the wine, reduce it by half and also add to the sauce. Allow to
simmer gently for 1 hour skimming frequently.<br>
3. Pass the sauce through a conical strainer into another pan, pressing lightly. Add another 2 litres
( 3 1/2 pt or 9 U.S. cups) stock, bring to the boil and allow to simmer gently for a further 2 hours.
Pass the sauce through a fine strainer and stir occasionally until completely cold.<br>
4. The next day, add the remainder of the stock and the tomato puree.; bring the sauce to the boil
stirring continuously with a wooden spatula or whisk, then allow to simmer gently and evenly for
1 hour skimming carefully. <br>
     Pass through a fine strainer or tammy cloth and stir occasionally until the sauce is completely

NOTES:<br>
1. The time required for the preparation and refining of this sauce cannot be indicated exactly as it
depends to a large extent on the quality of the stock used in its making. The refining of this sauce
will be quicker if the stock is of very good quality in which case an excellent Espagnole can be
prepared in five hours.<br>
2. Before adding tomato puree to this sauce it is advisable to spread the required quantity on a
tray and to cook it in the oven until it turns a light brown colour. This will destroy most of the
excess acidity found in tomato purees, and when prepared in this way, the puree assists in
clarifying the sauce and at the same time dives it a smoother taste and a more agreeable
colour."<br>

"Brown, Espagnole or Spanish Sauce (Sauce Brune Espagnole).</b><br>
Espagnole or Spanish sauce is a leading sauce from which many smaller ones are made. To obtain a good espagnole, it is necessary to have good stock (No. 421);
in case there be no stock specially prepared for this purpose, use good clear broth. For four quarts of stock, melt in a saucepan one pound of butter, 
stir into it the same weight of very dry, good lfour, so as to obtain a clear paste; then let it cook for four or five minutes on the fire, without cerasing to stir, 
and afterward set it back to a very slow fire, or in a slack oven, to let it get a good dark brown color, being careful to move it about
ovten. When the roux is cooked, take it from the oven and dilute with the prepared stock not having it too hot, and stir the lqiuid abian over the fire to 
brint it to a boil. Should the sauce not be sufficiently smooth--should any lumps appear in it, then strain it through a fine 
sieve, and put it back into the saucepan; and at the first boil, set it on one side so that it only boils partially, and let it despumate in this way for 
two or three hours. Skim off well the fat, and strain the broth into a vessel to let get cold, meanwhile stirring frequently.""

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Demi-glace & brown sauces</b></font><br>
Demi-glace descends from <a href="foodsauces.html#espagnole">Espagnole</a>. The traditional recipe is complicated and requires much time.
Modern chefs sometimes create a <a href="foodsauces.html#browndeglazingsauce">Brown deglazing sauce</a>, a quicker way to achieve approximate results. Brown
sauces are often flavored with tomatoes, fortified red wine (Madeira, Port), white wine, mushrooms/truffles. 
<p>

<b>What is demi-glace?</b><br>
"Glace de viande) and demi-glace, two French culinary terms which are less closely connected than might be supposed but which can 
be conveniently be treated together. Glace de viande is meat glaze, a greatly reduced meat stock which has a syrupy consistency 
and can be used to impart its flavour and a shiny surface to appropriate savoury dishes, and to give additional flavour and body to sauces. 
References to this meat glaze at the beginnning of the 19th century include Viard (1806), who describes how a veal stock which has been reduced to the 
consistency of a sauce can be used as a seasoning, and Beauvilliers (1814), who uses a little brush of chicken feathers to brush his meat 
glaze...Demi-glace is not a base of lesser or greater concentration...but a sauce. To be precise, it is an Espagnole sauce which has been reduced by boiling 
before further dilution with a clear meat stock. The distinction is made quite clear by Escoffier...In the course of the 20th century certain 
French chefs 'revised' the classic demi-glace, making it in simpler fashion...Guerard's Cuisine minceur (1976) has 
instructions for glace and demi-glace..." <br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson, 2nd edition Tom Jaine editor [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2006 (p. 340) 
<p>
"Demi-Espagnole...Careme means what today is called demi-glace. 'Pour half the grande espagnole into a saucepan with the same 
volume of good clear chicken soup to which has been added the trimmings of mushrooms and truffles.' And Careme adds instructions for 
the preparation of this soup in a marginal note. 'The consomme is made with the carcases and giblets of two chickens, moistened with good 
stock (too much salt must be particularly avoided). Next, add a carrot, a couple of onions, and, after having skimmed it carefully, let it 
simmer. About two hours later, strain it through muslin or sieve without pressure. Leave it to stand, and then strain it thoroughly 
before using. 'Put the saucepan on a hot fire and stir with a special espagnole wooden spoon until it is bubbling all over. Then move it to the 
corner of the stove; skim carefully and remove every trace of fat. In this state, leave it for a full three-quarters of an hour. 
After this, skim off the fat, and put the stock on a hot fire. Stir the espagnole with a wooden spoon, to prevent it from boiling over, which will 
otherwise happen because of the very rapid boiling necessary to preserve as far as possible the essence which is really the palpable spirit of the 
sauce. While working the sauce, you will see it gradually taking on that brilliant glaze which delights the eye when it first 
appears. Finally, when it is suitably reduced, strain through a tammy cloth.." <br>

"18. Sauce Demi-glace</b><br>
This sauce, commonly referred to as Demi-glace, is made with Espagnole which is brought to a final stage of perfection by further careful simmering and skimming. It should be finished at the 
last moment with a little meat or other glaze. Demi-glace can be flavoured with various wines such as sherry,  port and Madeira. The additoin of a particualr wine naturally
changes the flavour and character of the Demi-glace and will decide its ultimate use. It is avvisable to add the wine being used at the last moment; by boiling the sauce the aroma
of the wine will be destroyed by evaporation.

A half-glaze sauce only differes form an espagnole by its lightness. Thsi sauce is generally made in large quanitites at a time, so as not to begin it so frequently,a s it
requires the utmost care in its preparation. Heat in a saucepan one pound of clarified butter, and when it is very hot fill it up with flour so as to obtain a paste rather too light than
otherwise; thicken it well while stirring for a few minutes on the fire, and then set it aside in a warm part to cook and brwon very slowly, without adhering to the bottom of the 
pan, and without letting it get black. Five or six hours after, pour it into a vessel, cover it with paper, abd let this roux stand to get cool. To make the sauce: dilute the roux very
slowly, with some beef stock (no. 194a), having it only slightly warm, and preapred for this purpose, and finish it exactly like espagnole, it must be as clear as possible and of a 
light color; strain and skim it well. Stir the liquid over the fire to thicken the sauce, managing not to have any lumps in it, and should it not be perfectly smooth, then starin it 
through a fine colander. Pour four ounces of butter in a saucepan, add to it four ounces each of sliced carrots, onions and celery root; the same quantity of lean ham cut in quarter
inch squares, a bundh of parsley garnished with bay leaves, thyme and allspice, fry without coloring, pour the sauce over the whole, add four gills of good white, dry wine, and a 
qaurter of a pound of mushroom parings, and let all boil while stirring, then remove it at once to the side of the range, and continue boiling on one side only, so as to be able to despumate it 
properly for several hours. Strain and but as much of this as is needed into a reducing saucepan with two gills of meat glaze (No. 401); boil, reduce it to the
necessary degree, using a spatula to stir it from the bottom, without leaving it for once instant, incorporate slowly into it a little good veal bond (No. 423) and small quantiy of good white
wine. When the sauce is succulent without being too thick, strain it through a tammy and pour it into a vessel, or else into a a saucepan to keep warm in a bain-marie.

"Cooking, the most conservative of the arts, has recently been going through a revolutionary period in France. A group of young chefs have redefined and purified the traditions of classic cooking, 
but the cookbooks have not yet caught up with the. If, for instance, you open the bible of haute cuisine, Escoffiers Le Guide Culinaire, you will see that most of the brown sauces, the sauces that go
 with meat, are based on a mother sauce known as <a href="foodsauces.html#espagnole">espagnole</a> or, in its more concentrated form, sauce demi-glace. These rich sauce bases used to be prepared in restaurants in quantity so that they
 would be ready for the sauce chef to use as the essential raw material for creating the so-called small brown sauces such as bordelaise, periguex or <a href="foodsauces.html#robert">
Robert</a>. Indeed, before World War II, every
 restaurant in France that produced classic meals produced espagnole. This, however, forced and employe to spend literally hours at a time skimming the scum off the top of a slowly simmering
 gigantic pot. Espagnole is a flour-bound (flour thickened) sauce, and flour throws off scum. Flour also makes and already rich liquid even heavier. After the postwar recover, labor costs rose 
steeply. It was no longer practical to tie up even an apprentice at this eternal skimming vigil. Diners, moreover, no longer were eating so heavily. They were demanding both elegance and lightness
 at table. Ergo, espagnole and <a href="foodsauces.html#demiglace">demi-glace</a> went the ways of the bustle. Today, if you mention these dark, rich gravies to a Paul Bocuse or a Georges Blanc, they smile and say, We dont do things 
that way anymore. We just make jus de veau lie. Now jus de veau lie was not born yesterday. Escoffier ran a recipe for this highly reduced veal stock too, so that the culinary revolution, or at least
 this aspect of it, did grow naturally out of the past. The young French chefs fastened on jus de veau lie because it solved both of their major problems. It involved much less labor, and it has no flour

"Gastrique. A reduced mixture of vinegar and sugar used in the preparation of hot sauces accompanying dishes made with fruit (such 
as duck with orange). Gastrique is prepared by heating the ingredients together (seasoning as necessary) until the liquid has 
almost entirely evaporated." <br>
---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, completely revised and updated [Clarkson Potter:New York] 2001 (p. 545) <br>

"When it comes to blending savory foods with fruits and berries--duck a l'orange, duck with cherries and the like--there is not much 
neutral ground. There are those who deplore such combinations and those who find them delightful. I am a member of good standing in this group... 
In cooking the [Calf's Liver With Grapes] I used a preparation, called a gastrique, that is commonly a part of the 
preparation of duck a l'orange and related dishes. Made by blending a little vinegar and sugar in a saucepan and cooking until the 
liquid evaporates and the sugar takes on a la light caramel color, it provides a trace of sweet and sour as well as a bit of color 
to a sauce." <br>

Culinary evidence confirms cooks have been pairing warm puddings with sweet sauces from Medieval times forward. 
Then, as now, recipes varied. The general purpose, in some cases, was to make the pudding more palatable and pleasing to 
the eye. Traditional recipes for bread and rice puddings include these ingredients. These dishes were often 
served to young, invalids, and aged because they were considered easy to digest and chew. Repurposing restorative properties for holiday steamed puddings makes
perfect senese. The sometime addition of  alcoholic ingredients (sack, brandy, rum, Madeira) also makes sense. In those days, small amounts of alcohol were considered medicinal
. Hard Sauce, as we know it today, descends from these traditions. <a href="christmasfood.html#plumpudding">Plum Pudding</a> is
traditionally served with Hard Sauce.
<p>
<b>What is "hard sauce?"</b><br>
"Hard sauce. A dessert topping made with butter, confectioners' sugar, eggs, and vanilla, dating in print to 1880."<br> 
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 150) <br>
[NOTE: This explains why early cookbooks don't have recipes with this title. A careful examination of earlier recipes traces the evolution of the
practice as well as the names. In the 19th century "Pudding Sauce" was the common name for what we know today as "Hard Sauce."]
<p>
<b>Why call it "hard sauce?"</b><br>
Two possible explanations, the first makes more sense. (1) The sauce, because it is butter based, can be whipped to a standing ("hard") consistency.
(2) "Hard" refers to the alcoholic ingredients, as in the opposite of "soft." The fact that hard sauces do not always contain alcohol suggest the appellation was not revering
to the liqueur.

 from the mixture sugar, butter and flavor. one-third cup of butter to one cup of sugar is sufficient, although one-half cup is used and some 
persons use as much as one cup of butter. I prefer granulated sugar, but many prefer powdered, and some use brown. One eminent authority 
gives as a sauce for English plum pudding this: One-third cup of butter, one cup of brown sugar, two tablespoons of brandy. As always the butter 
is creamed, the sugar gradually worked into it, the brandy dropped drop by drop. This sauce may be used in a pastry tube, as can most hard 
sauces. It is used with apple fritters and so forth as well as with puddings. Fresh or preserved fruit may be added to hard sauces. Beaten egg 
whites may be folded into them, or whipped cream. A hard sauce of interesting character may be made with corn sirup and butter and nothing

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Hollandaise</b></font><br>
Food historians generally agree that Hollandaise sauce was a French invention, most likely dating
to the mid-18th century. Why the reference to Holland? This country (or more broadly the
Netherlands) was famous for its fine butter and good eggs.
<p>
"Hollandaise. One of the most prominent suaces in the group of those which are thickened by the
use of egg yolk. The fact that such a sauce will curdle if heated beyond a certain point is largely
responsible for their reputation of being  difficult. McGee (book: Curious Cook)...has
investigated both the history and the chemistry of the sauce. He reports that one of the earliest
versions which he found, " sauce a la hollandoise", in the 1758 edition of Marin's <i>Dons de
Comus</i>,
calls only for butter, flour, bouillon, and herbs; no yolks at all'...Sauces which are derived from, or
can be regarded as variations of, hollandaise include: sauce aux capres, maltaise, mousseline,
moutarde (Dijon mustard)."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
383)
<p>
It is interesting to note that the classic Dutch cookbook <i>De Verstandige Kock</i> (The
Sensible Cook), circa 1683, contains several recipes for sauce meant for fish featuring butter, spices, verjus/lemon juice or wine. Few
of these list eggs as an ingredient:<br>
<blockquote>
<b>[1683]<br>
"To Make a Sauce for a Boiled Sturgeon.</b><br>
Take youg Onion cooked in Butter, Chervil, Parsley, Pepper, and Wine vinegar, let it cook
together. It is a good sauce." (p. 70)
<br>
<b>To stew small Bundles of Young Eels with Herbs.</b><br>
Split the Eel open and wash clean. Take Sorrel, Chervil, and Parsley, some Rice, a little Mace,
tied close [and] boiled in water, some Salt in it. When the Eel floats then take it out and place on
an earthenware collander and a sauce of Butter and Vinegar with an Egg is poured over it. Is
good." (P. 69)<br>

"Dutch Sauce, or Sauce Hollandaise</b><br>
Take 4 oz. of the freshest butter;<br>
First reduce, in a quart of stewpan, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, seasoned with 1 pinch of salt, and 1 small pinch of mignonnette pepper; 
when reduced to a teaspoonful, take it off the fire; add 2 tablespoonfuls of cold water, and 2 yolks of egg, well freed from white;
 replace on the fire for a minute, stirring well, with a wooden spoon; avoid boiling; take off the fire, and add a sixth part of
the cold butter, and stir till melted; then put again on the fire for a minute, and add another sixth part of the butter; repeat
this process until all the butter is used, mixing occasionally a tablespoonful of cold water, to prevent the sauce getting too
thick or curdling.<br>

Observations.--It is often the case that flour, potato-flour, or even melted butter, is mixed with Dutch Sauce; these additions, whilst
needlessly increasing the work, only tend to destroy the character of the sauce, which should have not other bases than yolk of egg

and whisk continuously over gentle heat whilst gradually adding 500g (1 lb 2 oz) soft or melted butter, ensuring the cohesion and 
emulsification of the sauce by the profressive cooking of the yolks. Add a few drops of water occasionally and as necessary during the
mixing of the sauce so as to ensure its lightness. Correct the seasoning with salt if necessary and add a few drops of lemon
juice. Pass through a fine strainer and keep at a lukewarm temperature so as to prevent the sauce from separating. This sauce
is specially suitable for serving with fish and vegetables. Note: It is advisable to increase the amount of water in the reductin if there
is any doubt about the quality of the vinegar but it is essential that a reduction is made; the required amount of acidity can
be obtained by the addition of more lemon juice."<br>

Mustard is a plant. Mustard is an herb.  Mustard is a condiment. Mustard is a sauce. Mustard is a <a href="foodfaq1.html#mustardgreens">green 
leafy vegetable</a>. 
Mustard is a natural medicine. 
<p>
Here, we address the condiment. Mustard seeds are pulverized to various degrees from course grinds to fine powder (aka mustard flour) and mixed with water, vinegar, milk/cream and
spices to achieve the condiment we know today. Recipes vary according to place and taste. <a href="foodsauces.html#frenchmustard">Dijon</a> may be the epicenter of fine French 
mustards, but Ancient Romans, Greeks, Indians and Chinese enjoyed this condiment long before it reached France. Mustard powder first surfaces in the 
18th century, creating a demand for "mustard in a minute." Cheap, flavorful, easily transported
and universally consumed. <a href="foodsauces.html#ketchup">Ketchup</a>, the rivaling American condiment, was introduced in the 18th century; tomato
ketchup, as we know it today,  surfaces in the 19th.

"Mustard. The name of several species of plant in the cabbage family. The seeds of three 
of them provide the condiment mustard. Several also have edible leaves...Some yield 
culinary oil. The thee plants grown for their seed are Sunapis alba, usually known as 
white or yellow mustard...Brassica nigra, usually called black mustard...and Brassica 
juncea, known as brown or Chinese mustard. The first two are native to Europe, the third 
originally Asian though now widely grown. The first and third now provide virtually all 
the commercial mustard. The sharp taste of mustard is due to the presence of various 
glycosides..."

<b>Why do we call it mustard?</b><br>

"In biblical times, the people of Palestine cultivated black mustard largely for its seeds, which they used to make oil for the ritual purpose of anointing. The ancient Hebrews and other Eastern peoples used large quantities of this oil, so they highly esteemed their mustard seeds. not only did they use the oil for anointing but they used the seeds for healing aliments of all sorts. The ancient Greeks assigned mustard seeds far-ranging healing properties and attributed the discovery of mustard seeds to Asclepious, their highly revered god of medicine. The Greeks also used mustard seeds (because of mustard's 'fiery' nature) as an aphrodisiac...Pythagoras recommended them as an antidote to poison...Early peoples of England and North America also used mustard seeds to counteract poison as well as to cure epilepsy, heart troubles, and toothaches; to cleanse the body; to clarify the blood and to relieve pain of gout...Ancient Middle Eastern legends recount tales of gigantic mustard plants...The mustard plant produced seeds smaller than any other seeds the people knew at the time; so the Hebrews...used the phrase <i>grain of mustard</i> to mean something infinitesimally small..In Hindu myths, mustard seeds enabled people to travel through the air, helped them locate treasures within the earth, and gave them the ability to effect transformations..."<br>

<b>Ancient Greek & Roman mustards</b><br> 
"Mustard was in use in northern Greece before 2000 BC and was thoroughly familiar in 
classical Greece and Rome. In ancient sources it is generally listed as herb, not a spice: 
this reflects its local origin and cheapness...and is generally the seed of mustard that is of 
most interest to humans. These seeds can be used directly in flavouring cooked dishes, 
but in Europe, certainly since Roman times, their usual fate is to form the main ingredient 
of a sauce with an unmistakable yellow colour, a biting taste and a tendency to make the 
nose smart. The earliest recipes for mustard sauce are given by Columella and Palladius; 
Columella already describes it as 'brightly coloured'. You ate it with ham, with other 
meats, and with certain fish including swordfish." <br>

"Mustard cultivation is ancient; witness remains of seeds at the Mycenaen site 
in Greece, and in the prehistoric Swiss lake village of Morigin. The Greek writer 
Herodotus mentioned mustard as a cultivated plant in the 5th century B.C., and around 
AD 42 the Roman agricultural writer Columella described a method of preparing the 
condiment which is not unlike modern practice." <br>

<b>Ancient Roman recipe sample</b><br>
"Mustard seed is carefully cleaned and sieved. Then the seed is washed in cold water and soaked for two hours. It is then taken out and the water is 
squeezed out by hand. Put the seed into a new, cleaned mortar, and pound it finely with a pestle. Once the mustard is finely ground, put it in the 
middle of the mortar and press it down with the palm of the hand. Once it has been pressed flat, make some incisions in it. Place a few burning colas on top of
it, and pour over soda water, to draw out all the bitterness and pallor from the mustard. Then lift the mortar and pour out the soda water. Add strong
vinegar and mix it through the mustard with the mortar. (Col[umella]. XII, 57). "<br>

"Carbonized seeds of rai, Brassica juncea subsp. junea, have been discovered at the Indus Valley site of Chanhudaro dated about 1500 BC.
Even today this seed, called mustard in India, is the major Indian brassica psecies...Sanskrit literature used in this context the term sarshapa, believed
to be of even earlier aboriginal origin...Two kinds of seeds are mentioned. Rajika is certainly the rai of today, a reddish seed, and 
siddharta (also called svetasarshapa and gaura-sarshapa) is probably yellow sarson. In Indian rituals, mustard seeds have a connotation of
disinfection...Commonly, all over India, the initial baghar operation begins wtih the frying of mustard seeds in hot oil till
they cease to splutter, followed by the frying inthe same oil of chopped onions and perhaps other spices; after this comes the frying of
meat, fish or vegetables; the mustard pungency is here mostly lost...The second way of using msutard seeds is to crush them into
a paste in which meat, fish, or vegetables are marinated before being cooked into distincly spicy dishes. The <i>Naishada Charita</i> 
(c. AD 1000) describes a bowl of curd spiced so pungently with mistard...There is historic intereset in th fact that a long-standing
 Indian system of weights, recorded in the <i>Manava Dharmashastra</i>, starts with one peppercorn (likya); this equals one
black mustard seed, and three of the latter are equal to one white mustard seed."<br>

<b>Mustard in Europe</b><br> 
"The Romans brought S. Alba and S. nigra 
to Britain, where both now grown in the wild. Mustard has always been important in 
Europe because it grows locally and is therefore the cheapest of spices. Medieval 
European courts often employed a mustardarius, an official who supervised the growing 
and preparation of mustard. The first sizeable commercial mustard businesses grew up in 
the mid-14th century France, around Dijon. The British mustard industry arose in 
Tewkesbury in the 16th century...The seed was ground, blended with horseradish, and 
formed into balls which would keep fairly well until broken up and mixed with vinegar, 
verjuice, wine, or other liquid...Since the Middle Ages there have been some 
developments of technology which has affected ways of using mustard, especially in 
Britain...Until the 18th century no one had found a way of drying the seeds enough for 
them to milled into a powder. The first successful process was developed by Mrs. 
Clements of Tewkesbury in 1720. Although this discover paved the way for the dominance 
in Britain of mustard powder, 'made mustard'...remained popular." <br>

"The mustard best known in Europe is the seed of white mustard, Brassica hirta 
(sometimes classified as Sinapis alba), a plant familiar in Greece at least four thousand 
years ago--a bag of mustard seeds turned up in the excavation of the Bronze Age site or 
Marmariani. An Egyptian find, of large numbers of mustard seeds in a twelfth-dynasty 
tomb, is almost as old as this. Until the beginning of the pepper trade, around 400BC, 
mustard...was certainly the hottest flavour in the Mediterranean. It was so hot, and so 
cheap, that fine Indian long pepper, hotter than black pepper and a very expensive item in 
Roman times, was sometimes 'fraudulently mixed with Egyptian mustard' on its way to 
Rome. European white mustard was attractive enough to others that white mustard had 
been transplanted to India and China by early medieval times. They had their own native 
mustards; these were so familiar that the ancient Indian law code Manusmrti names the 
smallest weight in the scale sarsapa 'one mustard seed'...The old French moustarde, origin 
of the English word, is first recorded in the thirteenth century. It originally denoted a 
prepared mustard sauce of just this type, but fruity as well as hot because it was made 
with 'must' or grape juice. Soon, in both French and English, 'mustard' came to be the new 
name of the plant as well. The sauce that people prefer varies from country to country, the 
hottest and the yellowest being the English kind--but some of the yellow comes from 
adding turmeric, and that is true of American mustard too. The making of moutarde de 
Dijon, the most popular French type, can be traced in Dijon to the fourteenth century." <br>

<b>French mustards</b><br>
"French mustards are sold in the form of a paste; the main centre for production is Dijon, followed by Meaux, Orelans, and Bordeaux. In France, the term 
'mustard' is reserved for the product obtained only from black or brown seeds (or both)...Black mustard then reached Gaul: and early 'recipe' appeared in the 4th century
and spread to Burgundy...iIn 1390 the manufactre of mustard was governed by regulations: it had to be made from 'good seed and suitable vinegar,' without any
other binder, The corporation  of vinegar and mustard manufacterers was founded at the end of the 16th century at Orleans and in about 1630 at Dijon. In the
18th century, a Dijon manufacterer called Naigeon fixed the recipe for 'strong' or 'white' mustard, the production of which was synchronized with 
the wine harvest, as the black and grown seeds were mixed with verjuice. Today, Dijon mustard is prepared with verjuice and white wine, Orleans mustard with
grape must (the French word for mustard is derives from <i>mout adent</i>, i.e. 'piquant must'). Meaux mustard, which owes its flavour and colour to 
coarsely crushed seeds of various colours, is prepared with vinegar, particularly at Lagny."<br>

"Mustard. If you want to prepare a supply of mustard to keep for a long time, make it from fresh grape must at harvest time. And some say that the must
should be boiled. Item: if you want to make mustard in a village [?], in a hurry, crush mustard seed in a mortar and moisten with vinegar, and put
through a sieve, and if you want to use it as soon as it has been strained, put it into a pot near the fire. Item: and if you want to make it well, and taking the
proper time, put the mustard seed to soak overnight in good vinegar, then crust it in a mill and add vinegar little by little; and if you have spices left
over from making aspics, claret, hypocras, or sauces, grind them along with this and let it mature. (MP 229)"<br>

"Dijon alone preserved Palladius' recipe, and if mustard was not invented there, at least Dijon restored it. When did the Dijonnais restore the indepensable
 condiment to the table? It is impossible to say. But under St. Louis the vinegarmakers were accorded the right to make mustard. In the thirteenth-century
<i>Cries of Paris</i>, we find: <i>Fine, good vinegar! Mustard vinegar!</i> The sauce peddlers ran through the Paris streets at dinnertime, crying, 
'Mustard sauce!...garlic sauce!...Scallion sauce!...Verjuice sauce!...Ravigote sauce!...' Anyone who wanted sauce for his meat opened his window, called the
sauce seller, and was served immediately with the sauce of his choice...A manuscript of the thirteenth century refers to Dijon mustard. In the fourteenth century,
Jean Millot included in his book of <i>Proverbs</i>: '<i>There is not town, if not Dijon. There is no mustard but in Dijon.</i>...When the Duke of 
Burgundy entertained King Philip of Valois with public celebrations, one hundred gallons of mustard were consumed at a single dinner...The earliest 
cookbook to appear in France, <i>Le Viandier</i>, by Taillevent, who was cook to Charles VII, praises mustard highly. His ancient French is difficult to
read, but I have done it for you, and here is what he says: 'One evening after a great battle with the English, Charles VII, with his three inseparable 
companions, Dunois, La Hire, and Xaintrailles, came to lodge in the little town of Sainte-Menehould, of with only five or six houses remained standing, it having been put to the
torch. The King and his suite were dying of hunger. there was nothing left in the ravaged countryside. Finally, four pig's feet and three chickens were procured. The
King had no cook with him, and the wife of a poor toolmaker was entrusted with the preparation of the chickens. As for the pig's feet, they were simply
laid on the grill. The good woman roasted the chickens, dipped them in beaten eggs, rolled them in bread crumbs with fines herbes, and covered them with a
mustard sauce. The King and his companions left only bones. King Charles VII often afterward asked for chicken a la Sainte-Menehould. Taillevent understood perfectly what he meant, and 
prepared it exactly as the toolmaker's wife had done.' Louis XI, who loved to drop in unexpectedly for dinner on his companions, the bourgeois of 
Paris, nearly always carried his own pot of mustard with him. In the accounts of J. Riboteau, receiver-general of Burgundy, we find an order placed by him with a
apothecary at Dijon for twenty pounds of mustard for the King's personal use...Louis XIV granted a coat of arms to mustard: funnel argent on 
azure."<br>

<b>English mustard</b><br>
"...it was [the Romans] who introduced [mustard] to Britain. It remained popular during the medieval period and beyond, not the least of its 
attractions being its cheapness compared with other hot spices that had been imported from far-distant lands. In those days Tewksbury grained a reputation for 
producing the finest mustard in England. But mustard-eating really took off in a big way in the nineteenth century when Coleman's of Norwich started marketing
yellow mustard powder in tins for the masses. Henceforth a dab of made-up mustard sauce became almost as automatic an addition to British main courses as
pepper and salt."<br>

"Mustard, in the form which at present prevails in England, was not known before 1729. Its old English name was senvy, from sinapis. The seeds, either
whole or coarsely pounded, were boiled in vinegar or <i>must</i>--whence the name, meaning a kind of pickle. The French to this day adhere much to
the old form; they grind the seeds to a fine flour, mix them with tarragon vinegar, and prseent tem for use thus moistened. English mustard as we now
have it was the invention of an old lady, Mrs. Celements of Durham. She ground the seeds in a mill exactly like wheat, and sold it as a very fine flour. 
She kept her secret and made a little fortune out of it, trotting about from town to town on a packhourse for orders, and contriving to secure the patronage of
George I. From her place of manfactory it came to be called Durham mustard; thorugh in fact it was no longer mustard--that is, something steeped in 
must."<br>

the spoon. If cold water be used, fermentaion is likely to result;  and if boiling water, the strength of the mustard will be lost. The best thing is to boil the water and use it when 
cold. A teaspoonful of salt should be added to every three or four ounces of mustard. To reduce the pungency a little sugar may be added. For a very mild
mustard, cream or milk is often used in the mixing, in place of half or all the water. When extra puncency is liked, a pinch of cayenne may be added. Pure
mustard should be used. Mustard soon discolours, and become very unsightly, as well as disagreeable to the taste, particularly in warm weather, and should be

<b>Mustard in America</b><br> 
"Mustard has been manufactured in America 
since colonial times. The most important American manufacturer of mustard was Robert 
Timothy French (1823-1893)...In 1883 French and his son, George J. French...moved 
their operation to Rochester, New York, where they sold spices, including powdered 
mustard and turmeric. The business became extremely successful after the introduction of 
their French's cream salad mustard in 1904. Sold as a condiment in glass jars, French's 
cream salad mustard was milder than other brands and was used mainly as salad dressing 
and as a condiment for hot dogs, a food commonly served in baseball stadiums. The 
company's association with baseball was symbolized by the adoption of the pennant as its 
official logo in 1915." <br>

usual consistence, rubbing it for a long time with a broad-bladed knife or a wooden spoon. It should be perfectly smooth. The less that is made at a time the
better it will be.  If you wish it very mild, use sugar instead of salt, and boiling milk instead of water.<br>

<b>"Keeping Mustard.</b>--Dissolve three ounces of salt in a quart of boiling vinegar, and pour it hot upon two ounces of scraped horseradish. Cover the jar

probably require about four wine-glassfuls or half a pint. Mix it well, using for the purpose a wooden spoon. When done, put it into a wide-mouthed bottle or into little white
jars. Cork it very closely, and keep it in a dry place. It will not be for for use in less than two days. This (used as the common mustard) is a very agreeable condiment for beef

The manipulation gradually developed as it became necessary for the manufactureres to cater to the public taste, and the result is that each manufactuer now has

the public as well as the preparations made by eminent manufacturers. The duty on ground mustard imported into this country is fourteen cents a pound, and

"Not everyone sees red as the color of barbecue sauce. Just as barbecue is defined as pork in some states and beef in others, the liquid used for
 basting and flavoring can vary from region to region. And ketchup is not at all as common as one may think. The vinegar-based sauces of North 
Carolina and are well known. But in South Carolina and parts of Georgia, barbecue sauce is often yellow-brown, based on mustard, not ketchup...
The mustard sauce found farther south--sweet and tangy-- can be varied infinitely. The basic ingredients are mustard (preferably that cheap 
lurid yellow ball park variety, but sometimes two or three classier kinds), vinegar and some sort of sweetener, like honey, molasses, brown sugar or 
cane syrup or a combination. Local cooks change the vinegar, sweetener and mustard to put their own imprint on the sauce...South Carolina-Style
 Mustard Sauce. Time: 15 minutes. 3/4 cup distilled white vinegar, 1/2 cup beef or chicken stock, 1/2 cup finely chopped onion, 1/2 cup seeded 
minced jalapeno chilies, 1/2 cup yellow mustard of Dijon-style mustard, 1/4 cup honey mustard or brown deli-style mustard, 1/4 cup light corn 
syrup (or to taste), 2 tablespoons molasses, 1 teaspoon black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper. Combine all ingredients in
 saucepan, and bring to boil. Reduce heat, and simmer until thick and richly flavored, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste for seasoning, 
adding additional salt or corn syrup as desired. This sauce goes great with just about anything. Yield: 3 cups."---"Have Barbecue, Will Travel:

Wizard of Oz movie trivia: When the Cowardly Lion gave his famous speech with the line "What makes the Hottentot so hot?" was he referencing the Hottentot 
African peoples? Maybe not, speculate some food historians.

Wright's commercial Hot-N-Tot sauce was a popular condiment sold about the same time as the movie was produced. While we do not have exact dates on the 
product's introduction,  it is possible that Los Angeles based screenwriters, producers, and actors were familiar with this sauce. The earliest print reference we
 find for Wright's Hot-N-Tot sauce is an ad published in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> (June 22, 1941 p. 17). The last print reference we find is an ad from the same 
paper (April 15, 1965 p. D4). The clincher for some? Wright's 1931 trademarked slogan "Puts the Barb in Bar-B-Q," is similar in construction to the Lion's speech structure.
 The connection, albeit undocumented, merits consideration.

<a name="jezebel">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Jezebel sauce</b></font><br>

Cooks have been pairing spicy fruit sauces with meat for hundreds of years. Vitamin C-rich fruits  pack a delicious punch of flavor.
Think:  <a href="foodfaq.html#porkapplesauce">Pork & applesauce</a>  and 
<a href="foodfaq1.html#cranberryturkey">Turkey & cranberry sauce</a>. 
 Combinations of sweet fruit or wine jellies and savory components (mustard, horseradish) 
are found in several cuisines throughout the world. 
<p> 
Jezebel Sauce, combining apple jelly, pineapple preserves, mustard and horseradish, presumably descends from 
this tradition. While most of 
the ingredient are traditional *old world* flavors, the addition of pineapple places it (most likely) in the 20th 
century. 
<p> 
Where exactly did Jezebel Sauce originate? Print sources generally point to the  
Mississippi gulf region, from Florida to Texas. Late 19th-mid 20th century Creole cookbooks contain peppered jellies and 
creamy horseradish mustard sauces but nothing remotely approximating Jezebel. The use of canned commercial products might suggest Jezebel was 
developed in corporate kitchens. We cannot verify this in print. 
<p> 
Early recipes recommend Jezebel Sauce as an exotic twist to traditional ham glaze. Pairing it with cream cheese 
and crackers happened later. The earliest print reference we find to a recipe for Jezebel Sauce was published by Clementine Paddleford, a popular newspaper columnist, in 1958. The location? 
Kansas, of all places. In 1967 this recipe went viral in local USA newspapers during the winter holidays. None of these articles offered historic notes or locus of origin. This recipe was also listed by other names; most notably "Fruit 
Horseradish sauce." The earliest print reference we find for this item is 1939. Sadly, there is no description to confirm its composition.

<a name="ketchup">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Ketchup</b></font><br>
<a href="foodsauces.html#mustard">Mustard</a> was known to the ancients. Ketchup surfaces in the early 18th century.
Food historians generally agree the predecessor of our ubiquitous All-American 
tomato-based condiment may have originated in Southeast Asia. Some believe the English word 'ketchup' was borrowed from Chinese, too. How is this
possible when tomatoes are a "New World" food? Original recipes for this pungent condiment were flavored with 
Asian ingredients. When tomatoes were introduced to <a href="foodsauces.html#chinesetomatoes">China</a> (circa 16th century), they were eventually incorporated. 18th and 19th century
British and American cookbooks offer dozens of ketchup recipes featuring a wide variety of tangy fruits, vegetables, nuts, 
and fish. By the end of the 19th century, American tomato ketchup, as we know it today, was commercially bottled and
widely consumed by a hungry public. In 1981, the USA federal government proposed <a href="foodschools.html#ketchup">
ketchup be classed as a vegetable</a> to satisfy school lunch nutrition requirements.
<p>
<b>What is ketchup?</b><br>
"When the term ketchup first entered the English language, at the end of the seventeenth century, it stood for
something very different from the bottled tomato sauce of today. At that time tomatoes were an expensive rarity, and
the ketchups were long-keeping, often vinegar-based sauces flavoured with mushrooms, anchovies, onions, lemons,
oysters, pickled walnuts, etc. They formed the essential ingredients of the proprietary sauces so popular with the
Victorians, of which Worcester sauce is virtually the only survival..."<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 177)
<p>

<b>Why call it ketchup (catsup)?</b><br>
"The etymological origin of the word ketchup is a matter of confusion. For almost two centuries speculation has raged regarding
the origin of the word and what it signifies...Elizabeth David suggests in her <i>Spice, Salt and Aromatics in the English
Kitchen</i> that the word 'derived form caveach, a form of spiced-vinegar pickle in which cooked fish was preserved.' She
announced that the word in different forms manifested itself throughout European cookery...E.N. Anderson believed that
ketchup was cognate with the French escaveche, 'meaning food in sauce.' Similarly, others have speculated that ketchup was
related to the Spanish and Portuguese words escabeche or escaveach, meaning 'a marinade or sauce for pickling.'...
American culinary historian reports, escabeche derived from the Arabic word iskeby and specifically referred to pickling with
vinegar. The term was Anglicized to caveach, and it appeared in print almost simultaneously with ketchup in English cookery
books. Still others have claimed that the word ketchup originated in East Asia. In 1877 Eneas Dallas speculated that the true
Japanese word was kitjap...However, if anything is clear in this etymological confustion, it is that the word kitjap is not of 
Japanese origin. Concurring in this opinion, the editor of the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> suggested that 'Japanese' cited by
many was possibly an error for 'Javanese.' This speculation was based on the presumption that some observers believed that
ketchup derived form the Malay language...Culinary historian Alan Davidson...believed that the term specifically derived from
the Indonesian word kecap. Owen presumed that retired British colonial servants brought the word back home with them from
Malaya. However, ketchup was entrenched in Britain well before the British possessed a colony in Malaya...Indeed, Malay 
dictionaries claim that ketchup is of Chinese origin...The editors of the Oxford English Dictionary, citing Douglas's Chinese
Dictionary, presented a different Chinese-origins theory, reporting that ketchup really derived from ke-tsiap, a word from the Amoy
dialect of Chinese meaning 'the brine of pickled fish.'"<br>

1996 (p. 4-5)<br>
[NOTE: We highly recommend Mr. Smith's book. It is thoroughly researched, historically documented, intelligently 
presented and a fun read.]
<p>
<b>What is the correct spelling?</b><br>
"...ketchup is among the few commonly eaten products with no agreed upon spelling. Ketchup, catchup, or catsup continue to be
used today, but other similar spellings have been employed for years...Over the past two centuries food commentators have 
presented cases for particular 'correct' spellings of the word...In America, Isaac Riley, editor of the 1818 edition of
The <i>Universal Receipt Book</i>, believed that ketchup was the correct spelling. According to Riley, catchup was a vulgarization, 
and catsup was simply an affectation...Until a few decades ago, catsup was the preferred spelling in many dictionaries. Today
ketchup clearly is in the ascendancy, and is the clear choice of lexicographers and manufacturers."<br>
---<i>Pure Ketchup: A History of America's National Condiment</i>, Andrew F. Smith [University of South Carolina Press:Columbia] 1996
(p. 6)
<p>
<b>What is American ketchup?</b><br>
"The word 'ketchup' conjures up an image of the thick, sweet, tomato-based condiment...Americans did not invent ketchup, which 
was not thick, sweet, or made from tomatoes...British explorers, colonists, and traders came into contact with the sauce
in Southeast Asia, and upon their return to Europe they attempted to duplicate it. As soybeans were not grown in Europe, British
cooks used such substitutes as anchovies, mushrooms, walnuts, and oysters. British colonists brought ketchup to North Ameirca, and 
Americans continued experimenting, using a variety of additional ingredients, including beans and apples. Tomato ketchup may
have originated in America. It was widely used throughout the United States in the early nineteenth century, and small
quantities of it were first bottled in the 1850s. After the Civil War commercial production of ketchup rapidly increased...tomato
ketchup became the most important version...In 1896 the <i>New York Tribune</i> reported that tomato ketchup was America's national
condiment...Up until 1900, ketchup was mainly used as an ingredient for savory pies and sauces, and to enhance the flavor of
meat, poultry, and fish. It then became famous as a condiment following the appearance of three major host foods: hamburgers, 
hot dogs, and french fries."<br>

indicate mayonnaise sauces accompanied jellied fish, in the traditional of aspic.
<p>

"Mayonnaise, a famous sauce which is, essentially, an emulsion of olive oil and vinegar (or lemon juice) stablized with egg yolk and seasoned to taste...As a French word
 mayonnaise, meaning the sauce, first appeared in print in 1808. However, an interesting curiousity is its appearance in the phrase 'mayonnaise de poulet' in a German

"The derivation of the word mayonnaise has always been a matter of some controversy. Among suggestions put forward in the past are that it is an alteration of 
bayonnaise, as if the sauce originated in the town of Bayonne, in southwestern France; that it was derived from the French verb manier, 'stir' (this was the chef Careme's
 theory); and that it could be traced back to Old French moyeu, 'egg yolk'. But the explanation that it originally meant literaly 'of mahon' and that the sauce was so 
named to commemorate the taking of Port Mahon, capital of the island of Minorca, by the duc de Richelieu in 1756 (presumably Richelieu's chef, or perhaps even the duke
 himself, created the sauce). English borrowed the word from French in the 1840s..."<br>

<p>
<b>Larousse Gastronomique explores name origin theories:</b><br> 
"Mayonnise--A cold sauce of which the basic ingredients are egg yolks and oil blended into an emulsion...'Culinary purists,'
writes Careme in his <i>Cuisinier parisien: Traite des entrees froides</i>, 'are not in agreement regarding the name. Some say mayonnaise, others
mahonnaise and others bayonnaise. 'I will admit that these words may be current among common cooks, but for my part, I protest that never in our great
kitchens (and that is where the pursit are to be found) are these three words ever pronounced. We always refer to this sauce
by the name of magnonaise. 'But how is it that M. Griomod-de-la-Reyniere, a man of logic and wit, could not see at first glance that magnonnaise, derived 
from the verb manier (to stir), was the most appropriate name for this sauce, which owes its veyr being to the unremitting stirring shich it undergoes in the 
course of preparation? I am more than ever convinced of this when I consider that it is only by working the liquid ingredients together
 (as may easily be seen from the detailed recipe for this sauce) that a very smooth, creamy sauce is finally produced; a sauce which is very appetising
 and unique of its kind, since it is totally unlike all other sauces, which are produced by reduction over heat.' However logical 
Careme's justification for the exclusive use of the term magnonaise may seem, we are not by any means convinced that it shold take the 
place of the usual form, mayonnaise. Mayonnaise, in our view, is a popular corruption of moyeunaise, derived from the very old French 
word moyeau, which means yolk of egg. For, when all is said, this sauce is nothing but an emulsion of egg yolks and oil. If all 
sauces stirred for a longer or shorter period, on or off the stove, reuqired a name deriving from the word manier, then a great many
many would come under this heading, for instance, Bernaise and Hollandaise."<br>

<p>
<b>Expanding on Grimod's notes:</b><br>
"Grimod praised the city of Bayonne for more than just its ham. In the controversy which still flares up form time to time, the writer
firmly decided that it was there that originated the mayonnaise sauce:'...Mayonnaise, Mahonaise, Bayonniase...the first of these words
is not French, the second points to a town with no reputation in gastronomic terms, all of which leads us to plump for 
Bayonnaise, for which the etymology derives form a city which is inhabited by a large numnber of inventive gourmands, and whic, moreover,
gives birth evey hear to the best hams in Europe.' Grimod's seeming levity, however, conceals a just grievance on the part of 
Bayonnais. The traditional interpretation for the name comes form the Siege of Port-Mahon, where, it has been suggested, the beseibers 
were so lacking in spplies that they were reduced to eggs and oil, hence the invention of the sauce. The first recorded reference to
this sauce does come from a dinner offered to the Duc de Richelieu, the victor of Port-Mahon in 1756, by the people of 
Marseille. But it is perhaps not for nothing that than <i>histoire de Marseille</i> is a synonym for an untruth; certainly in 
Bayonne, the 'golden sauce' is throught to have an older history. Grimpd was fond of chicken bayonnaise as a cold entree."<br.

<b>Raymond Sokolov weighs in:</b><br>
"The Eighteenth Century...Members of the royal court invented new dishes, or tather they appropriated the glory for their discovery from helpless chefs...The greatest of these
noble discoveries, if in fact occurred, was the world premiere of mayonnaise, said to have taken place at the table of the Duc de
Richelieu, second cousin of the cardinal, after the capture of Port Mahon in 1759. This is the most disputed of all sauce
origins. Some people are persuaded that mahonnaise was indeed transformed into mayonnaise. Others find a more appealing etymology
in the old-fashioned word for egg yolk: moyeu. Careme insisted on yet a third alternative: "Some people," he wrote, "say
mayonnaise, others mahonnaise, still others bayonnaise. It makes no difference that vulgar cooks should use these words, but I urge
that these three terms never be uttered in our great kitchens (where the purists are to be found) and that we should always 
denominate this sauce with the epithet, magnonaise." Careme was convinced that his etymology made the most sense: 
magnonaise came from the verb "manier," to handle or work, which, he argued, was exactly what one did to produce a good
mayonnaise...If I may further add to the confusion, it seems to me improbably that no one has yet proposed a fourth solution to the 
problem. Since most sauces are named after places (bearnaise, venitienne, italienne, africaine), it is logical that mayonnaise 
refer to one also. Unfortunately, there is no town of Mayonne; however, there is a city in France, at the western edge of 
Normandy, called Mayenne. Who is to day that mayonnaise did not begin as mayennaise?"<br>

1 1/2 tbls vinegar (or its equivalent in lemon juice if the cause is required to be very white)<br>
Method<br>
1. Whisk the yolks of egg in a basin with the salt, pepper and a little of the vinegar or a few drops of lemon juice.<br>
2. Add and whisk in the oil, drop by drop to begin with, then faster in a thread as the sauce begins to thicken.<br>
3. Adjust the consistency occasionally by adding the vinegar or lemon juice.<br>
4. Lastly add 2 tbs boiling water which is added to ensure that the emulsification holds if the sauce is to be reserved for
later use.<br>

<p>
"Mirepoix: A culinary preparation created in the 18th century by the cook of the Duc de
Levis-Mirepoix, a French field marshal and ambassador of Louis XV. It consists of a mixture of
diced
vegetables (carrot, onion, celery); raw ham or lean bacon is added when the preparation is with
meat. A mirepoix is used to enhance the flavour of meat, game and fish, in the preparation of
sauces (notably espagnole sauce) and as a garnish for such dishes as frog's legs, artichokes and
macaroni. When a mirepoix is used in braised or pot-roasted dishes, it should be simmered gently
in a covered pan until all the vegetables are very tender and can impart their flavour to the dish.
Mirepoix without meat is mainly used in the preparation of shellfish, for braised vegetable dishes
and in certain white sauces."<br>

"A mirepoix is a mixture of finely chopped vegetables, typically onion, carrot, and celery, fried in
butter and used for flavouring stews and other meat dishes, as a base for sauces, and as a garnish.
It was reputedly devised in the eighteenth century by the cook to the Duc de Levis-Mirepoix, a
French field marshal."<br>

"Mireopoix, Charles-Pierre-Gaston Francois de Levis, Duke of (1699-1757). Mirepoix was  an
incompetent and mediocre individual', writes Pierre Larousse at the end of the 19th century,  who
owed his vast fortune to the affection Louis XV felt toward his wife'. This same author informs
us that the unfortunate Mirepoix had one claim to fame: he gave his name to  a sauce made of all
kinds of meat and a variety of seasonings'...But what exactly, in the 18th century, constituted a
dish a la Mirepoix? The answer is hard to supply since it is not until the 19th century that the term
is encountered regularly in French culinary texts. Beauvilliers, for instance, in 1814, gives a short
recipe for a Sauce a la Mirepoix which is buttery, wine-laced stock garnished with an aromatic
mixture of carrots, onions, and a bouquet garni. Careme, in the 1830s, gives a similar recipe
calling it simply Mire-poix and, but the mid-19th century, Gouffe refers to a Mirepoix as  a term
in use for such a long time that I do not hesitate to use it here'. His mirepoix is listed among
 essences' and, indeed, is a meaty concoction (laced with two bottles of Madeira!) Which, like all
other essences, was used to enrich many a classic sauce. By the end of the 19th century, the
mirepoix had taken on its modern meaning and Favre in his <i>Dictionnaire universel de
cuisine</i> (c. 1895, reprinted 1978) uses the term to describe a mixture of ham, carrots, onions,
and herbs used  as an aromatic condiment when making sauces or braising meat."<br>

<b>19th century Careme & 20th century Escoffier: compare & contrast</b><br>
"Sauces, like all else, are continually changing in details whilst the foundations upon which they are built change but little if at all. There are five foundation sauces or 
basic sauces, called in French Grandes Sauces or Sauces Meres [mother]. Two of them have a record of two hundred years between them; they are the 
Bechamelle and the Mayonnaise. They have lasted so long, not only because they are very good, but because they are so adaptable and provide a fine basis for a 
considerable number of other sauces. The other three, which also date back to the eighteenth century, are the Veloute, the Brune and the Blonde; Careme called 
these last two Notre Espagnole and Notre Allemande, to emphasize that both were French sauces and that their names were due to their dark and fair 
complexions. These five sauces still provide the basis for the making of many modern sauces, but no longer of most of them. Modern sauces may be divided into 
two classes: the Careme and Escoffier classes. Among the faithful, in the great kitchens of the world, Escoffier is to Careme what the New Testament is to the Old. 
Careme and his disciples produced sauces that were works of art: beautiful and delicious, but complicated. Their chief concern might have been--and probably 
was--to camouflage as much as possible the meat, game or fish served with some sauce. Many of sauces which Careme used or introduced were strong and spicy...
Escoffier took a different view: he was the apostle of simplicity; he wanted his sauces to help and not to hide the flavour of whatever dish they adorned. He 
introduced...fumets and essences...evaporated stock obtained by allowing the water, milk or wine in which meat, fish or vegetables happen to be cooked, to steam 
away slowly so as to leave behind a fragrant concentrate as a basis for whatever sauce will be served with them."<br>

 similar; liquid; and liaison. In other words...starting from a basic sauce, any number of ingredients can be added to give to each a particular sauce its own distinctive 
flavor...The difference between the basic sauces of haute cuisine and those of the home cook is not necessarily in the ingredients used. For all intents and purposes,

Careme's original scheme contained five foundation sauces: veloute, bechamel, espagnol, mayonnaise
and allemande.  Escoffier is generally credited for elevating tomato sauce to this lofty position.

"It was Careme who began to classify sauces. The hot sauces, which are by far the more
numerous, are subdivided into brown sauces and white sauces....and they too, have innumerable
derivatives. Cold sauces are usually based on mayonnaise or vinaigrette, and they also have many
variations."<br>

"In addition to stocks, the repertoire of French haute cuisine contains a multitude of sauces, in
which different ingredients are added to stocks and cooked in a number of ways. They all tend,
however, to be variations on the them of several basic, or "mother" sauces: espagnole, veloute,
bechamel, tomato, and hollandaise."<br>

<p>
"French sauces are the height of culinary technique...They are also part of a structure so orderly and Cartesian that it could only
be French...French sauces are not just a group of randomly assembled essences and emulsions. They come in families, each one 
which descends from one basic sauce known appropriately as <i>sauce mere</i> or mother sauce. Once you have made the mother
sauce (which is rarely served by itself), you can make all the small or compound sauces (the ones that are served) in a 
matter of minutes by adding the appropriate special ingredients that make up the particualr sauce...The sauce system is like a group
of family trees that evolved over centuries and reached their fullest elaboration in the late nineteenth century. The system was
codified by Escoffier after World War I, and it is still the basis for what is called <i>haute cuisine</i> or classic
cuisine in France today. Not it is a fact that younger chefs in France have radically "simplified" their menus and no longer
cook precisely in the manner of Escoffier...as far as sauces are concerned, they have eliminated or virtually emliminated flour
as a thickening agent for the mother sauces. Instead, they reduce their stocks further and use other liaisons: cream, butter,
hollandaise and egg yolks, as well as arrowroot. This amounts to a fundamental change in direction. Its proponents assert that
flour muddied the taste of the (now) old-fashioned espagnoles and veloutes. They go on to say the streamlined nature of 
modern life demands lighter sauces that do not overwhelm the basic elements of the dish which the sauce accompanies. These
arguments are persuasive up to a point. Flour-bound sauces do tend to be more present as a complex taste and a texture than do 
sauces based on pure reductions of veal stock. On the other hand, in my opinion it is a slander on the past and an error to dismiss
150 years of professional saucemaking as a muddy, glutinous botch."<br>

Chicken Bechamel Sauce, and Bechamel Sauce Maigre (without meat) on pages 265-6. None of 
these list crayfish as an ingredient. Mr. Gouffe is aware of crayfish, providing recipes for 
Crayfish a la Bordelaise (which uses Espagnole sauce), crayfish butter, crayfish for garnish, 
crayfish tails canapes and crayfish en coquilles.

"Crayfish Sauce (Sauce Nantua) </b><br>
One of the best and most desired sauces, to serve as an accompaniment to tubot, brill, salmon, or trout, cooked in a court 
bouillon. This preparation, a little more complicated than most sauces served with fish, can be described as follows: a bechamel 
sauce base, reduced with creme fraiche, and to which crayfish butter and crayfish tails are added at the last moment. Time: A 
good hour. Serves 10. <br>
For the bechamel: 30 grams (1 ounce, 2 tablespoons) of butter and 35 grams (1 1/4 ounces) of flour for the roux blanc; 3/4 
litre (generous 3 cups) of boiled milk; a half onion, finely minced; a bunch of parsley sprigs and a sprig of thyme tied 
together with kitchen string; 8 grams (1/3 ounce) of salt; pinch of pepper, a hint of grated nutmeg; 2 decilitres (6 3/4 fluid 
ounces, 7/8 cup) of very fresh thick cream. <br>
8-10 medium crayfish or 15 smaller ones; 100 grams (3 1/3 ounces, 7 tablespoons) of butter; a few drops of red food coloring. 
Procedure. The bechame sauce: Prepare it in a 1 1/4-litre (5-cup) capacity, heavy-bottomed pot. First, color the onion in the butter 
for 2 minutes, before adding the flour; follow the directions already given for preparing this sauce... <br>
The crayfish: For the quantity of crayfish suggested, put in a saute pan: 30 grams (1 ounce), 2 tablespoons) of butter; 30 grams 
(1 ounce) of finely minced onion; 2 parsley stems, rougly chopped; a sprig of thyme; a portion of bay leaf almost the size of a 
fingernail; a deciliter (3 1/3 fluid ounces, scant 1/2 cup) of white wine; a pinch of salt and pepper. Heat without boiling, then add 
the crayfish, properly trimmed as directed in their section...Saute over high heat; cover; cook over low heat for a good 10 
minutes. <br>
Next, remove the carapaces one by one. Put them on a plate. On another plate, gather all the debris, the shells, and heads. With 
a knife, remove the 'string' in the tail. Cut them in half lenghtwise. Put them in a small pan or other utensil that can withstand high 
heat, because the tails must be reheated before being added to the sauce, although they must absolutely not boil. Pour over the 
liquid from cooking though a fine linen cloth to strain; add a teaspoon of fine champagne (cognac) and a tablespoon of mushroom 
cooking liquid, if possible, or add some water. Cover. Set aside. With the remaining 70 grams (2 1/2 ounces, 1/3 cup) of butter, prepare 
the crayfish butter...as directed, straining through the sieve into a double boiler. Set aside at room temperature. 
To finish the sauce: Strain the bechamel sauce thorugh a chinois into a small saute pan. Add some cream, but reserve 4 good 
tablespoons. Put the pan over high heat and redce the suace, stirring constantly, until it has thickened and is no more than about 
4 1/2 deciliters (scant 2 cups). <br>
Remove the sauce from the heat. Mix in the reserved cream, which thus retains its flavor. Again, strain through a chinois into a double 
boiler. Gradually, add the crayfish butter, in pieces about the size of a walnut, mixing with a whisk. Next, add the food coloring, drop by 
drop, until the sauce becomes a good pink color. Set the pan over the double boiler pan. Just before serving, add the crayfish 
tails." <br>

Boil, stirring, for 1 minutes; remove from heat. You now have a thick seuce veloute. Blend the egg yolk and 1/3 cup of cream in 
a bowl with your wire whip; beat in the hot sauce by driblets. Stir over moderately high heat until sauce comes to a boil; simmer for a moment, adding 
more cream by spoonfuls to thin out sauce--it should coat a spoon nicely. Taste carefully for seasoning, adding salt, pepper, and drops of lemon juice 
as you feel it necessary. This is now a sauce parisienne. Fold in the cooked shrimp. If you are not serving immediately, 
float a spoonful of cream over top to prevent crusting, and refrigerate. Just before serving, bring to the simmer for a 
minute or two, to warm the shrimp and blend flavors. Immediately before serving, remove from heat and fold in as much shrimp 
butter as you wish, added by spoonfuls. With the addition of the butter you now have shrimp in sauce Nantua; do not bring near the simmer

Normandy sauce derives from <a href="foodsauces.html#veloute">Veloute</a>, one of the classic French <a href="foodsauces.html#mother">Mother sauces</a>. This sauce reflects 
the rich dairy and seafood dishes famous in this region of France. <a href="foodsauces.html#joinville">Joinville sauce</a> descends from Normandy.
<p>
"Sauce Normande. Normandy cream is justly famous; thick and rich, it is the basis, along with Normandy butter and apples and 
seafood, of a great regional cuisine. Sauce Normande...is the classic, but that is to say national, version of a 
somewhat different regional sauce. Basically, it is a reduction of fish fumet, veloute, and heavy cream. Serve it with sole, other 
delicate fish and oysters.<br> 
---<i>The Saucier's Apprentice</i>, Raymond Sokolov [Alfred A. Knopf:New York] 1976 (p. 152) 
<p>
"Dishes in the Normandy style typically contain butter, cream, seafood, apples, apple cider, and Calavdos, an apple-derived 
brandy. Sole a la Normande, one of the earliest precursors for a host of dishes braised in white wine, was actually created by 
Langlais, a Parisian native, in 1837, while chef at Rocher de Cancale, a celebrated restaurant in Paris which operated from 1795 
until 1860. Normandy sauce is typically served with croustades; omelettes; and braised or baked with fish. It is also a 
base for the following sauces...Anchovy Sauce, Diplomat, Lobster Sauce, Oyster Sauce, Veron Sauce, Orleans Sauce, Parsley 
Sauce, Pondicherry Sauce." <br>

<a name="pesto">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Pesto</b></font><br>

Food historians generally trace the origin of the concept of pesto to ancient condiments made by
grinding spices with mortar and pestle and combining them with oil. The word  'pesto' literally
means  'pounded'. These types of foods were known in the Persia and ancient Rome. The key to
understanding pesto is basil, the primary ingredient. Pounded basil products were
noted in Italy in Medieval times. Today, pesto is a popular accompaniment to many dishes
served in restaurants and at home. The French call this sauce <a href="foodsauces.html#pepinpistou">Pistou</a>, with a nod to Italian origin.
<p>
<b>About basil</b><br>
"Basil., aromatic plant. Basil was already being eaten by slugs in ancient Greek gardens, but why
it was grown there is uncertain. In the modern Near East basil is grown for its aroma by not
traditionally used in food. In the ancient world it was controversial whether basil should be taken
as fod, though according to Galen some ate it as a salad, dressed with olive oil and garum. Its
medicial qualities are recorded from the Hippocratic Regimen onwards. The basil of the
Mediterranean is Ocimum americanum. The ancient name was okimon in Greek, ocimum in
Latin; the now-familiar name basilikon appears first in early medieval texts, and the two are
equated in Byzantine sources such as the manuscripts of Simeon Seth's dietary manual, but some
scholars, including Laufer, have doubted that the ancient okimon is realy basil."<br>

<b>About pesto</b><p>
"Genoa is closely associated with its basil and pesto. Pesto is said to be of Persian origin, and
although the pounding of coriander and garlic into a pesto is quite old in the Middle East, I
believe the origins of Genoese-style pesto may be Roman, as they were known to have made
pounded condiments. Although we can't be sure of the first use of pesto, we do know that Genoa
was associated with basil the star ingredient of this pesto, as early as the mid-fifteenth century,
from the story of the humanist ambassador and lawyer Francesco Marchese, who won his fame
on the basis of a remark he made to the Duke of Milan upon presenting him a tub of basil; if
treated well, basil gave off a very nice scent, if dealt with harshly, it produced serpents and
scorpions."<br>

"In Genoa, the birthplace of basil, and all along the Ligurian coast, the air is redolent of
basil...The most famous Genovese sauce, pesto, is made of basil which has been worked to form
a durable, portable sauce, perfectly suited to long, hazardous voyages of discovery. It had been
suggested that during the crusades, the Genovese contingent could be easily identified even as far
afield as Jerusalem, by the characteristic aroma of pesto that surrounded them...Originally,
[making pesto] was a slow, laborious procedure since the basil, garlic and nuts had to be pounded
by hand with a pestle and mortar-hence the name  'pesto'."<br>

"Italian Spaghetti Paste</b>. Those who are fond of spaghetti may be interested in learning of an Italian paste which, though not new, is relatively little
known. Called Pesto Genovese, it is dark green in color and is made of finely chopped parsley, anise, basil, garlic, cheese, olive
oil and seasoning. it needs only to be added to oil or margarine to make a delicious sauce. The kind we have in mind is 
Poggiolo brand. The paste, which is especially popular with Italians, has a pungent anise flavor, in which a trace of basil is 
also apparent. For this reason, a linking for anise is a prerequisite to its use. Although the directions on the tin call for
two tablespoons of the paste to be mixed with oil as desired, those with conservative tastes will find one tablespoon sufficient 
for each serving of spaghetti. Mix it with one tablespoon of oil, or with one and a half tablespoons of fortified margarine. 
The sauce should then be heated, added to the spaghetti and sprinkled generously with an Italian-type grated cheese. One six-ounce tin
of the paste will serve twelve persons. If all of the package is not used at once, the remainder may be kept in a glass jar in the
refrigerator. Pesto Genovese, which is often referred to simply as green paste, may be found at most Italian grocery stores, and, 
specifically at Manganato's, 488 Ninth Avenue, where it sells for 28 cents."<br>

"Pasta al Pesto (pesto means "pounded," and refers to the mode of preparation) is the distinctive contribution of the Northern 
Italians to the culinary art. Into a mortar placed generous quantiteis of fresh basil--the dry will not do--and a few cloves of 
garlic. Pound vigorously with a pestle, adding small quantities of olive oil from time to time, until garlic and basi merge 
into a fine paste. Complete the process as described for pasta al burro, adding this paste and butter to the pasta. Pestle and
mortar are stock kitchen equipment in many Italian homes; if they are not avialable, the ingredients may be minced on a cutting
board with a heavy, straight-edges knife. If a knife is used, the mincing must be continued until garlic and basil are 
thoroughly fused. This seasonal dish--it can be prepared only when fresh basil is available--is an extraordinary pleasant
experience both for the nostrils and the palate. Its only disadvantage is that it may unduly whet the appetite. I once knew
a man in Florence who wagered that he could eat two pounds of pasta al pesto--six ounces in a generous portion for the average
man --after a normal dinner. The prize was a barrel of Chianti. He won the wager and lived to drink the wine!"<br>

1/4 cup chopped pine nuts or walnuts.
<p>
1. Make noodles: Sift four with 1/2 teaspoon salt into medium bowl. Make well in center. Add eggs and water; beat with for until well combined. Dough will be stiff. Turn out on wooden board. Knead dough until it is smooth and elastic--about 12 minutes. 
2. Cover with bowl; let rest at least 30 minutes. Divide dough into four parts. Keep covered with bowl until ready to roll out. On lightly floured pastry cloth or board, roll each part into a rectangle, about 16 by 14 inches. The dough should be aobut 1 1/6 inch thick.
3. Work quickly, because dough dries out. From long side, roll up loosely as for jelly roll. With thin, charp knife, cut roll crosswise, 18 inch wide for fine noodles, 13 inch wide for broad. Unwind noodles, stretching slightly, and wind loosely around fingers. 
4. Arrange on ungreased cookie sheets. let dry overnight. Makes 1 pound. Next day, about 1/2 hour before serving, make pesto sauce: In bowl, with spoon or with mortar and pestle, blend butter with Parmesan, parsley, garlic, basil and marjoram.
5. Gradually add 1/4 cup oil, beating constantly. Add nuts, mix well. Makes enough sauce for 8 ounces cooked noodles. meanwhile, cook half of the noodles (8 ounces). In large kettle, bring 3 quarts water, 1 tabelspoon each of salt and olive oil to rapid boil. 
6. Add noodles. Bring back to boiling, cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally with long fork to prevent sticking, just until tender--7 to 10 minutes. Do not overcook. Drain well, do not rinse. Toss with sauce in heated dish, to coat well. Serves 4."<br>

"Pesto</b> If you never had a cause to be glad ou have a nose, pesto might lift you to new realms of nasal appreciation. One of the most
aromatic of human concoctions, pesto is to your kitchen as the first hyacinth of spring is to your garden. Pesto is a powerful
mash of fresh basil and garlic, moistened with olive oil, sparked by sharp cheese, and subtly textured by pulverized nuts. It is 
commonly used as a sauce for pasta, yet its thick, pastelike consistency makes it readily usable as a seasoning in the preparation of
other dishes...It stores well in the refrigerator or freezer, so you can keep it on hand for a quick pasta dinner--or for whatever
other special dish you might want it for. Thsi recipe makes about 2 1/2-3 cup--plenty for 6-8 servings of pasta.

<a name="remoulade">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Remoulade</b></font><br>

Food historians generally place the genesis of Remoulade in the 19th century. They do not attribute this recipe to a specific person or place. Nor do they agree on 
one specific *original* recipe. Our survey of historic French and American cookbooks confirms several variations. Most (with the exception of the Cajun/Creole
 version) descend from a <a href="foodsauces.html#mayo">mayonnaise</a> base. 
<p>
"Remoulade...a French culinary term which usually refers to a mayonnaise-like dressing with mustard. It is thought to have been derived in the 17th century from a 
name used in Picardy for the black radish, whose piquancy is not unlike that of mustard. In the past, the term designated a broth flovoured with chopped anchovies,
 capers, parsley, spring onions, garlic and a little oil. Its modern sense (a mayonnaise-like emulsion) seems to have evolved in the 19th century. It is now rarely 
encountered in France except as an element of celeri remoulade, a popular salad made of grated celeriac...and mayonnaise..that has been highly seasoned with 
Dijon mustard."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2nd edition, 2007 (p. 660)
<p>
"Remoulade is a piquant mayonnaise-based sauce used as a dressing for salads, cold meats, etc. Authorities differ on precisely which additions are necessary to
 turn mayonnaise into remoulade: the classic French ingredients are chopped gherkins, capers, and herbs, but simpler versions are made containing only a touch 
of mustard, while to nineteenth-century English cooks, who were quite keen on remoulade (Mrs. Beeeton makes it clear that it was often called simply French 
salad dressing), cold hard-boiled egg yolks were a sine qua non. French remoulade appears to derive from ramolas, a word in the northern dialect of Picardy for
 'horseradish' which came ultimately from Latin armoracea."<br>

<b>What is Sauce Robert?</b><br> 
"The barbe Robert is essentially a 'fortified mustard sauce'--that is, a boiled mustard with additional spicing. As Recipe 163, the Vatican copy of 
the Viandier shows only the name of this sauce: La barbe Robert, autrement appelee la Taillamaslee. No recipe is offered there. In a 
sixteenth-century printed cookbook that is rooted in the Viandier tradition, we find a recipe for Sauce barbe Robert which is at least related to our 
text--the name suggests that. However, apart from being a spicy, hot mustard mixture, it has clearly been modified rather freely over the
 intervening generations. We may note in the Viviendier, though, that the direction to use des epices teles et si fortez dque bvour y avez vo 
goust, seems to give the cook considerable latitude in elaborating this sauce. The later, printed version additionally includes 
fried onions and vinegar; and, rather than a cooking sauce for chicken, it is to be used to dress roast rabbit or fried fish. At least the sauce's 
name appears to have been durable."<br>

<b>Who was "Robert?"</b><br>

<a name="roux">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Roux</b></font><br>
"Roux.  The various kinds of roux are used as thickening agents for basic sauces, and their
preparation,
which appears to be of little importance, should actually be carried out with a great deal of care
and
attention.' So begins August Escoffier's article on Roux in his monumental <i>Guide culinaire</i>;
almost an
entire page is devoted to roux brun, though only short paragraphs deal with the preparation of
roux blond
and blanc. Etymologically, and historically, all this makes perfect sense. Roux in French literally
means
 'reddish' (or  'orange') hence the first roux were made by cooking flour and butter together until a
reddish tint
was obtained then using this to thicken a souce or broth. Its widespread use in French cooking
seems to
date from the mid-17th century. At that time, La Varenne (1651) described the preparation of a
liaison de
farine (flour thickener) made by cooking flour in lard and, by the end of the century, cooks are
referring to
this mixture either as farine frit or roux. By the mid-18th century cookbooks authors are advising
that  roux
de farine'...be cooked until the butter and flour are  a nice yellow' and recommend that the
resulting paste
be stored for later use...The roux had its critics...and some French gastronomes began
complaining about
the over-use of roux in sauces as the 19th century approached. Careme came to its defence in the
1830s
calling those who dared criticize the use of roux  ignorant men'...A roux, writes Careme, is an
indespensible
to cooks as ink to writers but, he warns, just as a poor scribbler cannot produce a masterpiece
simply by
dipping his pen into that black liquid, a sauce is not necessarily impoved if the roux has not been
simmered
with sufficient care. In recent years the roux has once again come under heavy criticism and, with
the
advent of nouvelle cuisine in the early 1970s, many chefs abandoned its use...But, despite its
chequered
history, the roux remains one of the cornerstones of French cuisine..."<br>

are Brown

are the foundation of all sauces, and upon their successful making depends upon the taste and
piquancy of

sauces of every kind is how to make a good "Roux," or the foundtion mixture of flour and butter,
or flour and
lard. We have the Brown Roux and the White Roux. In making a brown Roux, this unfailing rule
must be the
guide: Never, under any consideration, use burnt or over-browned flour."<br>
---<i>The Picayune Creole Cook Book</i>, facsimile 1901 2nd edition [Dover Publications:New
York] 1971
(p. 158)
<p>

<b>Here is the recipe from this book (circa 1901):</b><br><blockquote>

<b>"Brown roux.</b><br>
1 Tablespoonful Butter. 1 Tablespoonful Flour.<br>
In making the roux, which is the foundation of fancy sauce, melt the tablespoonful of butter
slowly, and add
gradually the flour, sprinking it in and stirring constantly, till every portion is a nice, delicate
brown. Never
make it too brown, because it must continue browning as the other ingredients are added in the
order given
in every recipe in this book. It is a great mistake to pile all ingredients, one after another,
pell-mell, into a
dish, in the course of preparation. The secret of good cooking lies in following implicity the
gradual
introduction of the component parts in the order specified.
<p>
     In making a roux for cooking gravies or smothering meats, the proportions are one
tablespoonful of lard
and two of flour, butter always making a richer gravy than lard, and sometimes being too rich for
delicate
stomachs. It is a great fad among many in our day to use nothing but butter in cooking. The
Creoles hold
that butter should be used its proper place, and lard in its own. The lard is not only less expensive,
but is far
preferable to an inferior quality of butter, and in many cases preferable to the best butter,
according to the
dish in course of preparation. Properly made, the taste of lard can never be detected, and it is
feared that
butter is used by many to cover up, by its taste, the deficiencies of having made the roux
improperly. If there
is the slightest indication of burnt odor or over-browning, throw the roux away and wash the
utensil before
proceeding to make another. Remember that even a slighly burnt sauce will spoil the most savory
dish."<br> ---(p. 159)
<p>
<b>"White roux.</b><br>
1 tablespoonful Butter. 1 Tablespoonful Flour. <br>
The White Roux is made exactly like the Brown Roux, only that the butter and flour are put
simultaneously
into the saucepan, and not allowed to brown. It is then moistened with a little broth or boiling
water, and
allowed to boil a few minutes, till thick. The White Roux is the foundation of all white sauces, or
those
containing milk and cream. It is also used in nearly all purees. In the Sauce Veloute it should be
colored."<br>

The first sour [cultured] creams were probably made by accident...it's what happens naturally to 
cream that is left too long in the heat. Food historians do not seem to have fixed an exact date or 
place to this event. <a href="foodfaq2.html#yogurt">Yogurt</a>, <a href="foodbeverages.html#sourmilk">sour milk</a>,

incorporated sour cream into traditional fare are generally located in central and northern Europe. 
Sour cream was introduced to the New World by immigrants from these regions.

"Sour cream 
An example of a dairy product in motion; its use has been steadily spreading westwards. It is a 
traditional and important ingredient in Russian, E. European, German, and C. European cooking, 
both in savoury and in sweet dishes. In the second half of the 20th century...it has started to 
become a staple in the western parts of Europe, N. America, and elsewhere...Russian smetana 
and Polish smietana are often taken by translators to be 'sour cream', although the dictionaries 
give the meaning of the words simply as 'cream'...Traditionally, sour cream was made by letting 
fresh cream sour naturally. Lactic (and to a small extent, acetic) acid-producting bacteria in a 
cream could normally be relied upon to give an acceptable taste...Modern cultured sour cream is 
made by pasteurizing and homogenizing light (English 'single') cream and inoculating it with a 
pure culture of selected bacteria." <br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 736) 
<p>
"'Sour' cream as distinct from 'soured' or 'cultured' is fresh cream which has been kept long 
enough to sour naturally. This may produce a pleasant or unpleasant flavor depending on the 
bacteria present in the cream. In countries where cooking with sour cream has long been a 
tradition, the kind used is that allowed to sour naturally but 'cultured' or 'soured' cream can be 
substituted successfully. Northern and Central Europe are the countries where sour cream is an 
important ingredient in cooking, and many of the recipes I include here have their origins in 
Russian, German, Hungarian, Polish and Czechoslovakian cooking. In Britain, particularly in 
farmhouse cooking, sour cream is traditionally used in baking in place of milk for making scones 
and similar goods." <br>

<b>Mexican-American food & sour cream: tradition or convergence?</b><br>
Food historians confirm traditional Central American recipes do not include sour cream. Cheesemaking was introduced by European settlers. They were not
 immediately co-mingled with native fare. Which begs the question: why is sour cream a 'staple' of contemporary Mexican-American cuisine? <p>
"Joe Valdez Caballero, who helped adapt Mexican food to American taste buds by creating a 
crisp taco shell and smothering his enchiladas in sour cream, has died at age 81. Caballero, 
considered a pioneer of Tex-Mex cuisine, died Friday, his family said. During a 37-year career at 
El Chico Restaurant in Dallas, Caballero was apparently the first restaurateur to put sour cream 
on chicken enchiladas, and thought up the idea of the hard taco shell, said Fred Cavazos, who 
worked many years with Caballero." <br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Sriracha</b></font><br>
Originally sriracha was a <a href="foodmexican.html#chile">chile-based</a> condiment from a seaside town in Thailand. 
How to spell sriracha? Our survey of American newspapers confirms 'sriracha' 
(122 mentions) is more popuar than 'siracha' (26 mentions) which may be
caused by transliterating from a different alphabet. According to the <i>New York Times</i>, the correct pronunciation is siracha.
While the first <a href="foodasian.html#thairestaurants">Thai-American restaurants</a> popped up in 1960s Los
Angeles, it was not until recently that the cuisine was known to mainstream Americans. 
 The commercial sriracha most
Americans know today was created in the greater Los Angeles area during the 1980s. It was concocted by a Vietmamese refugee who used some of the proceeds to help his family & friends
immigrate to America. By the 2000s, sriracha joined the ranks of designer condiments and trendy mash-up ethnic foods. By 2015, the condiment/sauce has become
a staple in many American homes. Here's the story...
<p>
<b>Thai chiles</b><br>
"Thai food is extensively spiced with chiles but, contrary to popular belief, there is not just one
'Thai chile', but rather many different varieties that are used in cooking...a total of seventy-nine 
different varieties have been collected in Thailand from three species: Capsicum annuum, C. chinense, and 
C. frutescens...the Kashmiri chiles are also called Sriracha or 
Sriracha chiles. They are so named because a sauce made from these chiles originated in the Thai
seaside town of Sriracha as an accompaniment to fish, and it became so popular that it has been
bottled and sold around the world. However, the chiles used in Sriracha sauce now are red serranos. In 
agricutural terminology, the two types of chiles grown commercially in Thailand are 'bird pepper' (prik khee
nu) and 'chile'' (prik khee fah)...The same trade routes that introduced the chile pepper into Thailand also
spread the concept of curries from India to all parts of the globe."<br>

is Siracha sauce. This was originally a chilli sauce make and sold locally in the little seaside town of Siracha. It was sold
on the beachfront seafood stands to accompany the fish. Because of its regional popuarity it was subsequently bottled and
sold commercially throughout Thailand. Siracha is available here in Thai stores and some supermarkets. It comes in both
red and yellow colorings and mild, medium and hot flavorings. Some other Thai chilli sauces are sweeter and have whole seeds and

"Some American consumers believe sriaracha (properly pronounced SIR-ratch-ah) to be a Thai sauce. Others think it is Vietnamese. The truth is that 
sriracha, as manufactured by Huy Fong Foods, many be best understood as ab American sauce, a poyglot puree with roots in different places and peoples. It's become
a sleeve trick for chefs...Sriarcha has proved relevant beyond the epicurean realm. Walmart sells the stuff. So do mom-and-pop stores...Sriracha is a key
ingredient in street food: The two kogi trucks that travel the streets of Los Angeles, vending kimchi-garnished tacos to the young, hip and hungry, provide customers
with just one condiment, Huy Fong sriracha. Recently, Huy Fong's sriracha found its place in the suburbs. Applebee's has begun serving fried shrimp with a
 mix of mayonnaise and...sriracha. Then followed F.F. Chang's...What Mr. Tran [founder of Huy Fong Foods in 1983] developed in Los Angeles in the early 1980s was his own take on the traditional Asia
chili sauce. In Sriracha, a town in Chonburi Province, Thailand, where homemade chili pastes are favored, natives do not recognize Mr. Tran's puree as their own. 
Multicutural appeal appeal was engineered into the product: the ingredient list on the back of the bottle is written in Vietnamese, Chinese, English, French and 
Spanish. And serving suggestions include pizzas, hot dogs, hamburgers and...pates. 'I know it's not a Thai siracha,' Mr. Tran said. 'It's my srircha.'" Like manny
immigrants of his generation, David Tran's journey from Vietnam to America was epic. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Mr. Tran's travel...was fueled by chili
sauces. From 1975 onward, Mr. Tran make sauces from peppers grown by his older brother...Though he never devised a formal name for his products, Mr. Tran
decorated each cap with a rooster, his astrological sign. Production was family focused...By 1979, many of the Tran family's friends were leaving Vietnam. 'I had
enough money saved to buy our way out,' he said...Mr. Tran did not anticipate the popularity of his take on sriracha...He figured that immigrants of Vietnamese
ancestry would stock his sriracha at pho [noodle] shops. He hoped that the occasional American connsumer might squirt it on hot dogs ad hamburgers. He could never
have expected what he found...Over the last decade, a number of imitators have entered the sriracha category...Demand has continued to build."<br>

"Soy sauce. The universal condiment of China and Japan, is also widely used throughout SE Asia.
It is the main
condiment of Indonesia, where soya beans are grown extensively...Although soya beans have been
grown in China for at
least 3500 years, the sauce is a slightly more recent invention. It was developed during the Zhou
dynasty (1134-246
BC) , and probably evolved in conjunction with the fermented fish sauces, many of which
involved both fish and rice.
The moulds Aspergillus oryzae and A. soyae are the principal agents in producing soy sauce, and
the enzymes which
they provide are similar to those which ferment fish sauce. These organisms are common and
could accidentally have got
to work on soya beans, with results which would have been recognized as a  fishless fish sauce'.
Early soy sauce was a
solid paste known as sho or mesho. This developed into two products, liquid shoyu and solid
miso. In China the liquid
sauce is used more than the paste, while in Japan both are of equal importance. The European
name  soy' (similar in all
lnaguages) originates with the 17th-century Dutch traders who brought the sauce back to Europe,
where it became
popular despite its high price."<br>

Ingredients suggest tapenade, a robust Provencal sauce featuring capers, anchovies, olives, and lemon juice, dates to ancient
 times. Food historians generally agree this delicious convergence of Mediterranean flavors is a relatively new
creation. J. B. Reboul [1897] names the restaurant and the chef (a friend of his) but does not share when or how Tapenade came to be.
Tapenade first surfaces in USA print in 
the 1960s. This make sense in context. Until recently, most French-American restaurants, culinary educators, and publications
 focused on a niched world where "French" and "Parisian" were synonymous. Tapenade's original purpose was to accompany eggs in appetizer format.
Today we graze a different table filled with tapenade dips, toast toppers, and pairings with mild fish or beef. USA cooks are
world famous for creative interprations. Tapenade on warm broiled salmon, anyone?

"The curious thing about this sauce is that it has a kind of ancient, powerful flavour about it, as
if it were something which might perhaps have been eaten by the Romans. Well, it was invented less than a hundred years ago
by the chef at the Maison Doree in Marseille, although it must certainly have been based on some already existing sauce. The original 
method was to stuff the eggs with the tapenade, plus the pounded yolks. At la Mere Germain's beautiful restaurant at Chateauneuf du Paper the tapenade is served
pressed down into little deep yellow earthenware pots, like a pate, and comes as part of the mixed hors-d'oeuvre."<br>

to a paste, then blend in the olive-garlic-caper mixture. I also like to add 1 to 2 tablespoons cognac and sometimes a tablespoon of 
Dijon mustard. Blend everything together well until you have a thick puree. Taste for seasoning. It will not need any salt, I can 
assure you, because of the anchovies, but it may need more cognac, a gew grinds of black pepper, a dash or two of Tabasco, or you 
may want to add a touch of thyme or summer savory. This delicious sauce for vegetables, eggs or fish will keep for quite a

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Tartar sauce</b></font><br>
Yes, tartar(e) sauce was named for the Tatar peoples of Mongolia. No, it is not a traditional
Tartar recipe. The word 'tatar' refers to the Turkic-speaking people [Tatars] who settled in Mongolia sometime
during the 5th Century AD.  In the food world,  'tatar'  takes on the French spelling  'tartare' and
is most often associated with tartar(e) sauce. Poultry and fish tartare recipes are fully cooked dishes accompanied by
tartare sauce. <a href="foodmeats.html#chickentartare">Chicken Tartare</a>, a Creole favorite, is a prime example.
<a href="foodmeats.html#steaktartare">Steak tartare</a>, composed of
raw ground beef, is an entirely different dish saddled with the same appelation. No wonder there is confusion!
<p>
Why is this recipe called  tartar sauce? And when was it first referred to a such? This is hard to
say. According to <i>Rare Bits: Unusual Origins of Popular Recipes</i>, Patricia Bunning
Stevens (p. 156) "Beef Tartare--finely minced lean raw beef--became fashionable in France in the
nineteenth century. It was named for the Tartars (Originally "Tatars") or Mongols who had
terrorized eastern Europe in the days of Gengis Kahn....Beef Tartare was usually served as it is
now, with a bevy of garnishes, including a piquant sauce with a mayonnaise base that came to be
called sauce Tartare or Tartar Sauce. Today, at least in the United States, it is more often served
with fish."
<p>
The first step in dating modern tartar sauce is dating the origin of this recipe's major component:
<a href="foodsauces.html#mayo">mayonnaise</a>. There are many variations on the recipe for tartar sauce; the simplest being a mix of mayonnaise
and chopped pickles. Elaborate recipes give instructions for making one's own mayonnaise and 
include chopped onions, scallions and a mix of spicy herbs.

tartar-mustard of the previous chapter, or good French mustard, is to be preferred to English for
this
sauce, which is usually made very pungent, and for which any ingredients can be used to the taste
which will serve to render it so. Tarragon vinegar, minced tarragon and eschalots, and plenty of

Place a round-bottomed basin in a deep sauta-pan containing some pounded ice, put two raw
yelks [yolks] of eggs into the basin with a little pepper and salt, and with a wooden spoon
proceed, with the back part of the bowl, to work the yelk of eggs, dropping in, at intervals, very
small quantities of salad-oil, and a little tarragon-vinegar, until a sufficient quantity of sauce is
produced; bearing in mind, that the relative quantity of oil to be used in proportion to the vinegar
is as five to one. When the sauce is finished, add some chopped tarragon and chervil, and half a

emerge."<br>

"How and when the tomato-as-condiment was first put on pasta is a mystery. The first mention of using tomatoes in a pasta dish
is actually French. In L'Almanach des gourmands (1807), Alexandre-Balthazar-Laurent Grimod de la Reyniere recommended that in the autumn,
 tomatoes be substituted for the purees and cheese usually mixed into vermicelli before serving. He justified this practice by noting
that 'the juice of this fruit or vegetable...gives a rather agreeable acidity to the soups into which it is put, which is generally
pleasing to those who have become accustomed to it.' Using tomatoes in soups was a long-standing practice in Italy...by Grimod's
time, tomatoes were also consumed in Paris...The marriage between pasta and the tomato is usually said to have taken place in Naples.
<i>La cucina casereccia</i>...has a recipe for macceroni alla napolitana, in which the pasta is boiled in a meat broth in which
tomatoes have been cooked...The recipe for macceroni alla napolitana is not a tomato sauce. it was not until 1837 that Cavalcanti write that the
secret of the successful dish of baked vermicelli with tomatoes...was to make the tomato sauce dense, to cook the pasta just
until firm, and to toss everything together in a pan. As for the accompanying tomato sauce, Cavalcanti wrote that whether it was made
from fresh, dried, or preserved tomatoes, there was no point describing its preparation, since everyone knew how to make it...
A recipe for 'macaroni a la napolitana,' combining pasta and tomatoes, first appeared in an American cookbook just a few years
later, in 1847. By the 1880s, the tomato had been established as the condiment of choice for pasta for the peasants of the
Campania region, and pasta itself had become a staple."<br>

<a name="sugo">
<p><b>About Sugo:</b><p>
""Juice." Both fruit juice and the juices that seep from meats being cooked. Italians may use the terms sugo (plural, sughi) and salsa interchangeably, but some cooks
 distinguish between the two--without agreeing on what those distinctions are. In his cookbook La Scienca in cucina e l'arte di mangiar bene (1891), Pellegrino 
Artusi insisted that a sugo di omodoro (tomato sauce) is "simple, i.e., made from tomatoes that are simply cooked and run through a food mill. At the most, you
 may add a small rib of celery and a few leaves of parsely and basil to tomato sugo, if you must." Salses, he contended, as accompaniments like greens auce...to 
other dishes. Yet sugo di carne, a suace made with meat juices (if with beef alone, it is called sugo di manzo), was well known among wealthy families of the 19th
 century, and sugo finto (fake sauce) is a common term used by poor people for a pasta sauce made to taste like a sugo di carne by using the same ingredients, but
 without the meat. And meat sauces are also termed salse. To further complicate matters the words ragu, and in Tuscany, tocco, are often used for a meat sauce...It
 would appear...that the two terms sugo and salsa are often interchangeable, with sugo reserved for a pasta sauce while salsa may be used to describe sauces that
 may or may not accompany pasta."<br>
---<i>The Dictionary of Italian Food and Drink</i>, John Mariani [Broadway Books:New York] 1998 (p. 249-250)<p>
"Sugo di Umido de Maiale (Campania) Rich Pork Stew Sauce. This rich sauce is typical of Naples and is used to sauce various lasagne, macaroni dishes, and 
timapny...The finished sauce will contain a substantial amount of fat, traditionally a prized source of calories for the poorer population."<br>
---<i>A Mediterranean Feast</i>, Clifford A. Wright [William Morrow:New York] 1995 (p. 280)
<p>
<b>Artusi's 1891 recipe translated here:</b><blockquote>
<b>"6. Sugo Di Pomodoro [Tomato Sauce]</b><br>
Later, I shall speak about another kind of tomato sauce that we call "salsa," as opposed to "sugo." Sugo must be simple and therefore compoased only of cooked, 
pureed tomatoes. At the most you can add a few chunks of celery or some parsley or basil leaves, when you think these flavors will suit your needs."
Editor's NB: "As Artusi points out, there is an important difference between "sugo di pomodoro" (which is described here) and "salsa di pomodoro" (which will be
 described in recipe 125). Unfortunately, English does not allow for this distinction and both dishes are therefore called tomato sauce. To avoid confusion, whenever
 the 'sugo" (rather than the "salsa") appars in a recipe the text will include a parenthetical reference to this recipe."<br>

<a name="tomatogravy">
<b>Tomato Gravy</b><br>
Technically, tomato sauce can't be a gravy. Why? Because gravies (by traditional culinary definition) are meat-based:
<br>
<b>"gravy</b> A sauce made from meat juices, usually combined with a liquid such as chicken or beef broth, wine or milk and thickened with flour, cornstarch or 
some other thickening agent. A gravy may also be the simple juices left in the pan after meat, poultry or fish has been 
cooked." <br>
<b>"sauce</b> n. In the most basic terms, a sauce is a thickened, flavored liquid designed to accompany food in order to enhance and bring out its flavor.<br>
---<a href="http://www.epicurious.com/tools/fooddictionary/"><i>Food Lover's Companion</i></a>
<p>
"Q. Is there a difference between tomato sauces and tomato gravies?<br>
A. That is indeed an interesting question in semantics. But let it first be said that the word "sauce" has a lot more class than does
the word "gravy." Where hot, savory sauces are concerned--those that accompany meat or poultry, for example--the words are 
generally interchangeable. Gravies, for the most part, have been thickened, generally with flour. But that is not invariably
true. I have known many first, second and third generation families of Italian origin who invariable referred to their
tomato sauces as tomato gravies, although they were unthickened with any any form of starch."<br>
---"Q&A," <i>New York Times</i>, January 18, 1978 (p. C6)
<p>
"I recently offered the opinion that there was essentially no difference between the words 'sauce' and gravy.' I averred that term
sauce had, to my ears at any rate, a much more sophisticated ring to it. Two readers who live in Manhattan had quite 
definate thoughts. One, Anne Mendleson, wrote: 'If I may amend your reply to the reader who wondered by her mother always 
spoke of tomato 'gravy,' the reason undoubtedly lies in the existence of two Italian words for 'sauce.': sugo and salsa. 
Authorities on Italian food invariably say that the distinction is untranslatable, and in Italian-language cookbooks it is not 
always consistently maintained. But roughly speaking, sugo (from latin sucus) means 'juice, gravy, essence,'
and salsa corresponds to our word 'sauce.' 'The family of salsa includes mayonnaise, roux-based preparations, salad dressings
and other vinegar- or lemon-based sauces, and in general most of the sauces that might be used with meat dishes. Sughi are almost
invariably served with pasta, and usually involved bringing out the essence or juice of their main ingredients through long or brief
cooking. Sughi are intrinsic to the identity of the dish--in other words, they are not just mixtures of ingredients
intended to gracer it. An Ada Boni's wonderful <i>Il Talismano della Felicita</i>, there is an entire chapter devoted to salse, but
sughi are scracely even mentioned by name, being subsumed under the identities of such classic pasta dishes as spaghetti alla
amatriciana and tagliatelle alla bolognese. Your correspondent's Italian mother was unquestionably making a literal translation
of sugo di pomodoro.' And Joseph Duome stated: 'You replied to a listener that 'a sauce may be more sophisitcated sounding,' 
etc. However, there is a diference to us of Italian origin who have had the ecstatic pleasure of smelling Mom or Grandma's
gravy slowly simmering for yours on a Sunday morning. (You know, Sundays and Thursdays were traditional pasta days; not Wednesdays.)
Gravy, as we learned was that sauce that had been highly elevated in taste by sauteing of the braciole, and subsequently, meatalls.
(Some Italian families sometimes added sausages or pork chops for a slightly different tasting gravy.) Thus without meat we knew
it as tomato sauce and with meats, gravy. yes, there is a difference despite the fancy marketing of the various brands of 
'sauces,' Some to my house sometime and take in the wondrous aroma of a real gravy!'"<br>

According to 
<i>I Grandi Dizionari Sansoni</i> (1979), the Italian word <a href="foodsauces.html#sugo"><b>sugo</b></a> has two definitions: (1) sauce (salsa) and (2) gravy (sauce with
meat). Indeed, Italian-American cookbooks confirm meat-based tomato sauces are sometimes referred to as "gravy." In

<b>What about milk-based tomato gravies & biscuits?</b><br>
<a href="foodcookies.html#biscuitsgravy">Biscuits & gravy</a> is a popular traditional combination
in Southern and Appalachian cuisine. Most gravies are based on milk, butter, fat & flour. Combinations are endless.
One of these combinations is Tomato Gravy. This is a very different recipe and application from the Italian-inspired

Our tomato expert (Andrew F. Smith) suggested the origin might have been inspired by late 19th century health advocates. The earliest recipe he identified 
(see below, 1892) titled Tomato Gravy, combining this fruit with cream, was published by Ella Eaton Kellogg, of Battle Creek. Note: this recipe is actually a sauce, as it 
does not use any fat drippings. Our survey of Southern cookbooks (current & historic) returned several tomato recipes; mostly sauces and ketchups. None of these combined 
milk/cream or were suggested to accompany biscuits.

"Tomato Gravy. Pervasive in Appalachia, where frugal cookery is foundational, this gravy is chunkier and more countrified than a

recipes to take advantage of the seasonal bounty. The recipe given here is a variation on pasta
primavera, a dish that has countless incarnations, although the classic version calls for a wide
assortment of vegetables and a cream-based sauce. The major twist is adding a dash of flavored
vodka to the sauce. You do not really taste the alcohol, most of which evaporates in cooking, but
a kind of peppery flavor does come through. Many herb-flavored vodkas are available, and it can
be fun experimenting with them."<br>

Food historians tell us Sauce Bearnaise descended from <a href="foodsauces.html#hollandaise">Hollandaise</a>. It surfaces in the 
19th century. 
<p>
"A bernaise is a hot creamy sauce made from butter, egg yolks, and vinegar or lemon juice, flavoured with shallots, tarragon,
chervil, thyme, bay leaves, etc. it is generally served with grilled meat of fish. It takes its name from Bearn, a region
in southwestern France."<br>

"Sauce Bearnaise. A relatively new sauce...bearnaise is now a universal favorite, almost everyone's choice for the greatest of
all sauces. Indeed, this sophisticated, thickish combination of vinegar-shallot-tarragon-chervil reduction, egg yolk, and
butter is a wonderful thing, and not a Sisyphean labor, although it cannot be stored. It requires no costly advance 
preparation--it has no mother--and it is the preeminent sauce for the preeminent contemporary dish: grilled meat. Bearnaise
also goes beautifully with grilled fish, especially salmon."<br>
---<i>The Saucier's Aprpentice</i>, Raymond Sokolov [Alfred A. Knopf:New York] 1976 (p. 175)<br>
[NOTE: Variations on Beranaise listed in this book include: Sauce Arlesienne, Sauce Choron, Sauce Foyot, Sauce Paloise and 
Sauce Tyrolienne.]
<p>
"Bearnaise and  Veron were both nineteenth-century creations. The former was made for the first time at the Pavillon Henri IV at
Saint-Germain-en-Laye outside Paris and was named for the antive province of the long-dead king."<br>
---<i>ibid</i> (p. 11-12)
<p>
"The association between the name of this sauce and the birhtplace of Henri IV had probably arisen because it was first
made by Collinet in the 1830s in a restaurant in Saint-Germain-en-laye called the Pavillon Henri IV. But a similar recipe
appears in La Cuisine des villes et des campanes published in 1818."<br>
---Larousse Gastronomique, complete revised and updated [Clarkson Potter:New York] 2001 (p. 91)
<br>
"Bernaise was created in the 1830s by Collinet at the restaurant Pavillon Henri VI, in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, in honor of
Henri VI (the "great Bearnaise"). Montmireil, chef to the Vicomte de Chateaubriand, created a dish of a thick
slice from the middle of a beef fillet, which he broiled and served with large turned potatoes cooked in butter and a brown sauce
seasoned with white wine and lemon juice, and garnished with parsley and tarragon. In modern times, chateaubriand is 
exclusively served with Sauce Bernaise, as is any grilled, fried, or roasted meat."<br>

thirds and allow to cool. Add 6 egg yolks to the redution and prepare the sauce over a gentle heat by whisking in 500g (1 lb 2 oz)
of ordinary or melted butter. The cohesion and emulsification of the sauce is effected by the progressive cooking of the 
egg yolks which depends to a great extent on its preparation over a slow heat.
 When the butter has been completely incorproated, pass the sauce through a fine strainer; correct the seasoning, add a littel
Cayenne and finish by mixing in 1 tbs chopped tarragon and 1/2 tbs chopped chervil. This sauce is specially suitable for 
serving with grilled meats. Note: Sauce Bernaise which is rather like a Mayonnaise but made with butter, cannot be served
very hot as this will result in the sauce separating; it should be served lukewarm. if the sauce should become too hot and
separate, it can be reconstituted by whisking in a few drops of cold water."<br>

"Bearnaise Sauce</b><br>
In sum, this is a hollandaise with a consistency thick enough to be picked up with a spoon, like a very firm mayonnaise, and in which 
the flavorings, much stronger than for hollandaise, include an infusion of shallot and tarragon. The shallot, as well as the thickness of the 
sauce, are the constants. Sauce bearnaise best accompanies any kind of grilled food, including meat and fish. For all the details of the
techniques, see those for hollandaise sauce (page 72), the skill and the risks being identical. Time: 15 minutes. Serves 6.<br>
4 tablespoons of good tarragon vinegar; 4 tablespoons of white wine; 15 grams (1/2 ounce) of shallots; a sprig of tarragon; 
2 sprigs of chervil; a pinch of coarse ground white pepper; 3 small egg yolks; 175 grams (6 ounces, 3/4 cup) of butter; a hgood teaspoonful of 
minced tarragon and chervil. <br>
Procedure. The infusion must be made without haste so that the ingredients have time to impart their flavor. It can be prepared well in adv ance
and kept in a cup untilyu are ready to make the sauce. In a small pan, combine: white wine, vinegar, coarse ground pepper, minced shallot, minced
tarragon, and chervil. Slowly bring to a boil, uncovered, so that the liquid is thoroughly impregnated with the flavor of the aromatics, 
reducing it gradually, until there are only 2 full tablespoons. strain through a fine strainer, pressing on the herbs to extract all their
essence. If it is to be used immediately, let it cool<br>
The sauce: Same cholice of pan and same technique as for the holandaise. Use a double boiler if you are inexperienced, which will permit
you to understand by instinct, so to speak, the degree of heat that is dangerous to exceed. Put the infusion in the pan with the 
egg yolks. Mix it with a whisk, Add a pinch of salt and about 15 grams (1/2 ounce, 1 tabnlespoon) of butter divided into pieces. 
Set it on the double boiler. Stir continuously. When you notice it beginning to thicken, add some butter, the size of a 
walnut, and whisk, stirring vigorously. Do not add more butter until the preceding piece is compeltely mixed into the sauce. With all the 
butter added, the sauce must have, as previously stated, the consistency of a very thick mayonnaise. The sauce need only be
warm for serving and, in any case, it cannot be served too warm without separating. Just before serving, add the teaspoon of 
minced chervil and tarragon."<br>

<a name="bordelaise">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Bordelaise sauce</b></font><br>
What is "bordelaise?" In the broadest culinary sense it is food, or a style of food, or dishes made with ingredients originating from the Bordeaux region of France. Bordeaux is famous for its wines, most notably red. 
<p>
Prosper Montagne's original <i>Larousse Gastronomique</i> [1938] attributes Sauce Bordelaise to Careme (19th century). Curiously? It is Jules Gouffe
 (mid-19th century)'s recipe that is reproduced, not Careme's. Kettner, a self-styled British gastronome of the late 19th century includes an entry for Bordelaise 
sauce, informing his readers the sauce does not exist. Raymond Sokolov revisits Kettner's hypothesis in the 1970s. 
<p>
Historic culinary texts confirm the existence of sauce recipes titled Bordelaise. Early ones call for white wine. Around the turn of the 20th century red wine became the recommended ingredient. We are not told why. Escoffier's Bordelaise uses red wine. His Bonnefoy sauce is a white wine counterpart. 
<p>
<b>Why call it Bordelaise? </b><br>
"Sauce Bordelaise. Culinary etymologies are fun to try one's had at, but it often turns out to be impossible to fathom what strange 
connections occurred in the mind of the chef who first name the recipe you are interested in tracing to its origins. Bordelaise, for example, means 
'the sauce from Bordeaux.' It begins with a red-wine reduction. Bordeaux is...the capital of red wine. A sauce with red wine logically should be dubbed 
bordelaise. The trouble is that bordelaise was originally made with white wine (also produced around Bordeaux, but that isn't the 
point) and the key ingredient in the sauce seems to have been the marrow, because dishes called bordelaise are customarily garnished with 
rounds of poached marrow. Figure that one out." <br>

Properly speaking, there is no such sauce, and very few of the books care to describe it. What is so called is a variety of the Genevese Sauce,

maitre d'hotel butter, into which has been wrought some chopped shalot. To those who love onion flavours the idea seems good, but 
many persons regret the order...for the Entrecote a la Bordelasie, from not taking into account that the shalot

are done. Then add the ladleful of Spanish or good brown sauce. Reduce all to the thickness of a cullis, skim it, and pass it through a

"Red Wine and Shallot Sauce (Sauce Bordelaise) </b><br>
This is characterized by shallots infused in, of course, Bordeaux wine. The acclaimed French chef Gouffe and his contemporaries used white 
wine, Sauternes, or Graves...These days, it's mostly red Bordeaux that is used to make the infusion. In home cooking, the infusion 
is added to the sauce brune, for which a good veal jus is absolutely essential. Ordinary bouillon does not have the intensity of flavor 
required to give the sauce the necessary degree of succulence. If using bouillon, you will need to supplement it with a meat glaze (glace de 
viande). In this case, make sure that the bouillon is not too salty since the sauce will be reduced by half for use. When you need only a 
small quantity of sauce--to serve with steak, for example--you can replace the sauce brune with a very good jus that has been reduced, to 
which you add an equally reduced infusion of shallot. Thicken with arrowroot. For the final buttering, you will needd a larger quantity of 
butter, adding it off the heat. Sauce bordelaise is most often accompanied by beef marrow, which is either cut into rounds and 
placed on top of the steak before it is sauced, or is cut into small cubes and mixed into the sauce just before serving. In the following recipe, we 
repeat the preparpation of the sauce brune (page 50), slighly shortening the preparation time. But it is always preferable, when 
possible, to includce the waiting times suggested. Time: 2 hours. Makes 1/2 liter (generous 2 cups). 
<p>
"4 deciliters (1 2/3 cups) of prepared sauce-brune, or a mirepoix with 30 grams (1 ounce, 2 tablespoons) of butter; 40 grams (1 3/8 ounces, 
3/8 stick) of carrots and the same of onion; parsley stems; a sprig of thume; bit of bay; 20-25 grams (2/3-1 ounce) of flour for the 
roux; 6 deciliters (2 1/2 cups) of veal jus. 
<p>
"For the infusion: 40 grams (1 3/8 ounces) of finely chopped shallots; 3 deciliters (1 1/4 cups) of good white or red wine; a pinch of white 
pepper; a fragment of thyme and bay (very little of the latter); 75 grams (2 2/3 ounces, 1/3 cup) of butter to finish the sauce; if used, 
80 grams (2 3/4 ounces) of beef marrow. 
<p>
"Procedure: The sauce: in a 1-liter (4 cup) pot, lightly color the mirepoix. Add the flour and cook it as for roux brun. Dilute with the 
just, proceeding just as directed for sauce brune (page 50). Allow 40 minutes of gentle boiling for the first stage of cooking. Strain 
and skim the sauce. The infusion: Meanwhile, put the ingredients for the infusion in a small sautee pan. Boil, uncovered, until the wine is 
reduced to a good deciliter (3 1/2 fluid ounces, 1/2 cup). Pour everything, just as it is, into the sauce. Continue with the 
skimming for a good 15 minutes. The final quantity of the sauce must be reduced to 4 good decliliters (1 2/3 cups). Strain again through the chinois 
and keep warm in a double boiler. Just before serving, add the butter, which will complete the sauce up to the right cantity, and depending on the 
dish, also add the poached marrow, as directed above. The beef marrow: With a good knife dipped in warm water, cut the marrow into small cubes. Throw 
them into boiling water. Cover and keep the water barely simmering for 8-10 minutes. Dry thoroughly on a cloth before adding the 
marrow cubes to the sauce." <br>

"Bordelaise, Sauce. </b><br>
The generally accepted manner of making this sauce is as follows: <br>
Streaky salt pork or mild bacon <br>
2 or 3 carrots <br>
2 onions <br>
1 shalk thyme <br>
1 small bay leaf <br>
1 cup red wine <br>
2 or 3 whole shallots <br>
6 whole peppercorns <br>
Dash cayenne pepper <br>
1 clove garlic <br>
1 tablespoon Espagnole sauce <br>
A sufficiency of stock <br>
Have a heavy iron pan or an earthenware casserole, not too large. Cover the bottom with thin slices of salt pork or bacon, cover these with diced 
carrots and onions, add thyme and bayleaf and place pan over a low heat to allow ingredients to sweat gently--that is, to bring out their juices slowly. When 
this is accomplished, add the wine, the whole shallots, peppercorns, a dash of cayenne, salt if needed, and the garlic, finely 
minced. Cook this very gently until the gravy produced is brown and sticky (technically this is now known as reduit a blace); then 
add some Sauce Espagnloe and enough stock for your requirements. Boil up gently, skim to remove surface fat, and strain the sauce through a fine 
strainer. Return to pan and again reduce sauce by slow cooking; add a small piece of specially good butter when serving. Ecxcellent 
with roast meat. If preferred, red Bordeaux may be used instead of white. In this case, add a little lemon juice and some chopped 
parsely when serving. This sauce must be rather highly seasoned. The Sauce Bordelaise can be improved by adding at a time of 
serving some poached beef marrow, cut into cubes, and a squeeze of lemon." <br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Cheese sauce & Mornay</b></font><br>
Our examination of historic UK, USA & French sources (cookbooks, newspapers) appears to confirm "cheese sauce" (aka Sauce 
Mornay) first surfaces in the late 19th century. The original/classic pairing was fish. Eggs come second. Vegetables 
appear to be an afterthought inspired by classic white sauce. Think: asparagus and Hollandaise and <a href="foodfaq.html#creamedonions">Creamed Onions</a>.
 USA food companies creatively promoted cheese 
sauces from the 1930s forward as quick economical options for creating family meals. Think: Velveeta & 
<a href="foodfaq.html#cheezwhiz">Cheez Whiz</a>.
Possible progenitors? <a href="foodfaq1.html#fondue">Fondue</a> (cheese dip), and <a href="foodfaq1.html#rabbit">Welsh 
rarebit</a> (chafing dish cheese sauce). 19th century cheese soup recipes are generally composed of similar ingredients; they are
a tad creamier and serve a different place in the meal. In the 1950s <a href="foodfaq.html#casseroles">casseroles</a> were sometimes 
"glued" with cream cheese sauces.

What is Mornay?</b>
"Sauce Mornay, a bechamel sauce flavoured with cheese, seems to have been created at the end of the nineteenth century. There are 
conflicting accounts as to whom its name commemorates. Some give the honor to the seventeenth-century French Huguenot writer 
Phillipe de Mornay, others to the son of its inventor, Joseph Voiron of the restaurant Durand in Paris, who was supposedly called 
Mornay." <br>

"Cheese Soup </b><br>
One and a half cupfuls of flour, one pint of rich cream, four table-spoonfuls of butter, four of grated Parmesan cheese, a
 speck of cayenne, two eggs, three quarts of clear soup stock. Mix flour, cream, butter, cheese and pepper together. Place
 the basin in another of hot water and stir until the mixture becomes a smooth, firm paste. Break into it the two eggs,
 and mix quickly and thoroughly. Cook two minutes longer, and set away to cool. When cold, roll into little balls about 
the size of an American walnut. When the balls are all formed drop them into boiling water and cook gently five minutes; 
then put them in the soup tureen and pour the boiling stock on them. Pass a plate of finely grated Parmesan cheese with 
the soup."<br>

"Cheese Sauce (Sauce Mornay) </b><br>
This has a lean bechamel as the base. When you add grated cheese, it becomes sauce Mornay. This sauce is not served in a sauceboat. Unctuous and very much thicker than an ordinary sauce, it 
must completely coat the food over which it is spread. It is used for fish in particular. But it is also appropriate for some white meats, as well as certain vegetables: cauliflower, Chinese artichokes (chirogi), 
endive, cardoons, celery,e tc. Depending on how it is used, several modifications are made. Time: About 1 hour, 15 minutes. Makes 1/2 liter (generous 2 cups) of sauce Mornay. 
4 tablespoons of lean bechamel sauce; 60 grams (2 1/4 ounces) of grated Gruyere and Parmesan, half of each (in other words, 3 medium tablespoons); 50 grams ( 1/3/4 tablespoons) of butter to finish the sauce. 
Procedure. The Gruyere must be a bit dry, because if it is too fresh it will make the sauce stringy. Make sure the Parmesan does not have too strong a flavor, which would overpower the 
sauce. It would be better, if that is the case, to replace it with the same quantity of Gruyere. If the sauce is intended for fish, add the cooking liquid from the fish. A fish served with Mornay sauce 
should be cooked in only a small amount of liquid--in other words, poached, depending on the case, with a little fish bouillon, white wine, or water mixed with lemon juice. Using this cooking 
liquid in the sauce will give it a stronger fish flavor. If the sauce is intended for use with white meat, poultry, or sweetbreads, do the same with the cooking juices from these dishes. When you add the 
cooking liquid from the fish or from the white meat, allow 1 deciliter (3 1/3 fluid ounces, scant 1 cup) of liquid for the above proportions...For vegetables, the sauce is simply finished with 
butter, added off the heat. For other dishes, you can add mushroom cooking liquid. And, no matter how the sauce is used, you can always refine it by adding a bit of creme fraiche and then continuing to 
reduce it until it reaches the correct consistency. In fact, the creme graiche addition enhances the basic bechamel sauce. Do not forget that the seasoning of sauce Mornay, whether it be for 
fish, meat, or vegetables, is most important. It must be verified very carefully, mainly due to the saltiness of the cheese itself. So, at the very last moment, when the butter has been added, taste the 
sauce to check if a little more salt is needed. You can spice it up with a point of cayenne (as much as can be held on the tip of a knife.)/ 
Procedure. Prepare the necessary quantity of bechamel sauce...Strain it into a small pan. If using cream, or any cooking liquid, this is the moment to add it, as directed below, before any other 
ingredient. Otherwise, simply bring the sauce to a boil for a few seconds. Add the cheese. Cook, stirring, until it is completely melted. Remove from the heat; it will not be returned again in the course 
of this dish. Finish with the butter, mixed in as pieces about the size of a walnut. The sauce is now ready for use, and 
is equally good for vegetable dishes." <br>

Chocolate gravy is a specialty of the American south and Appalachian regions. This flour-thickened sauce is served with biscuits for breakfast. There are (at least) two theories regarding
the origin of this recipe:
<p>
"Spanish Louisiana had a trading network in to the Tennessee valley. This trade may have
introduced Mexican-style breakfast chocolate to the Appalachians, where it is called "chocolate
gravy." (Another possibility is that the very old population of mixed-race Appalachian
Melungeons has preserved the dish from the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Spanish colonies
on the East Coast.)"<br>

University Press:New York] 2004, Volume 1 (p. 699)
<p>
"Chocolate gravy in the Appalachians? Yes, say Mark Sohn of Pikefill, Kentucky, who says this
recipe has been handed down over the years by mountain families in his region of eastern
Kentucky and West Virginia...It's a milk-and-flour-based sauce that should be cooked thick
enough to stick well on open biscuits."<br>
---<i>Smokehouse Ham, Spoon Bread, & Scuppernong Wine: The Folklore and Art of Southern
Appalachian Cooking</i>, Joseph E. Dabney [Cumberland House:Nashville] 1998 (p. 210)
<p>
"Chocolate Gravy. This gravy, once served by isolated Highlander families as a treat for children, is now a treat for adults.
Why? Because while adults have hond memories of chocolate gravy, children don't know it. They don't see it advertised on TV, and they
can't buy it...When I first heard about this sauce, the name did not appeal to me. Later when I tasted its
smooth chocolately sweetness, when I lifted it with butter and biscuit to my mouth, when I first smelled the chocolate and saw it
shine, then its flavor filled my chocolate-craving taste buds and it entered my long-term memory. I will never forget that
moment. As badly as an itinerant preacher seeks converts, I want you to taste this gravy! Our elderly mountain cooks make chocolate
gravy with canned "cream," a product that manufactureres call evaporated milk. To this "cream," they add enough water so the
gravy will flow and spread, but not so much that it runs over the plate...Chocolate gravy is a milk and flour-based sauce, a white
sauce or a bechamel. It is low in fat--spoon for spoon, it has fewer calories than butter, cream cheese, chocolate sauce, 
marmalade, or strawberry jelly--and it is low-cost and easy to prepare. It is thick, full, smooth, and chocolatey. And when the 
gravy is cold, it cane be used as a cake filling--it softens as it warms."

<b>ABOUT CHOCOLATE SAUCE & PUDDINGS IN AMERICA</b><br>
Mid-19th American century cookbooks contain recipes for hot chocolate drinks (shaved from
unsweetened block chocolate), cocoa and chocolate puddings. Late 19th century American
cookbooks also contain recipes for chocolate cakes, frostings, candy, and fudge. This coincides
with the mass-marketing of chocolate to the American people (the Hershey company was founded
around this time). Creamy chocolate products (puddings, especially) were promoted in the late
19th century by food companies and domestic scientists as healthful foods for their milk content.
Typical early thickeners included corn starch, arrowroot, and gelatine. 
<p>
<b>SO WHERE DOES CHOCOLATE GRAVY FIT IN?</b><br>
The taste for breakfast chocolate is hundreds of years old. Modern recipes for chocolate gravy
may have evolved from popular 19th century combinations of cocoa and pudding.  Many of the
articles we find (1980-present) referencing chocolate gravy attribute it to "grandmother's recipe"
without noting dates or author's ages. None of the standard American cook books we have
suggest combining chocolate with biscuits. Presumably this combination can be found in 
community cookbooks published by churches, women's clubs etc. Up "North," chocolate chip
pancakes are consumed with gusto. Same basic idea; different presentation.

<b>Where did tomatoes originate?</b><br>
Food historians generally agree the ancestors of the fruits we now call tomatoes originated in the Andes.<p>
"Sophie Coe and others explain that the tomato originated in north-western S. America, where the ancestor of our edible tomato was most likely L. cerasiforme, 
S. pimpinellifolium, or currant tomato, which bears a long spray of tiny red fruits which split on the plant is another candidate, but L. cerasiforme has greater genetic
 similarity to the cultivated variety than any other. The edible descendant traveled north to Mexico and was one of the Solanaceae cultivated by the Aztec. There is
 no evidence that the wild varieties were ever eaten in their lands of origin, and all tomatoes consumed in S. America were reintroduced after the Spanish 
Conquest." <br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2nd edition, 2007 (p. 802) 
<p>
"The tomato (lycopersicon esculentum) is an American plant with an American name. In Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, tomatl indicates something round and
 plump, and this fruit (rather than vegetable) was almost certainly domesticated in Mexico, even though the presence of its numerous wild relatives (consisting of at
 least seven species) in South America suggests that it originated there. Apparently, however, tomatoes were not much used in the Andes region." <br>

<b>Tomatoes in Europe</b><br>
 Tomatoes were introduced to Europe from the New World by explorers in the 16th century.
They were not immediately embraced because they were considered poisonous. Tomatoes were
grown as "botanical curiosities," not as food. Tomatoes grew easily in the Spain and Italy and
were widely used in Southern European dishes by the 17th century. Tomatoes slowly spread
throughout Northern Europe, then back to the American colonies. 
<p>
"The first description of the tomato in the Mediterranean was in 1544, by the Italian botanist
Pierandrea Mattioli. He was desribing the yellow-fruited varity, and it has been suggested that the
Italian word for tomato, pomodoro (apple of gold), derived from this variety...Another theory of
the origin of pomme d'amour is that it is a corruption of pomme des mours, "apple of the Moors,"
in recognition that two important members of the Solanaceae family, the egglant and the tomato,
were favorite Arab vegetables. At first the tomato was used only as an ornamental plant in
Mediterranean gardens because growers recognized it as a member of the nightshade family, then
only known as comprising only poisonous members such as mandrake."<br>
---<i>A Mediterranean Feast</i>, Clifford A. Wright [William Morrow:New York] 1999 (p.
213)
<p>
"The tomato, initially regarded as an ornamental fruit and later adopted as a food, was an exotic curiousity that first
appears in the writings of P.A. Mattioli and Jose de Acosta, travelers and naturalists. Apart from these sources, allusions
to its consumption are very rare. Costanzo Felici tell us...that the usual "gluttons and pople greedy for new things" did not
realize they could eat the tomato as they would eat mushrooms or eggplants, fried in oil and flavored with salt and pepper.
Although we must not exclude the possibility that tomatoes were consumed at an earlier date by the common people, it is only at the
end of the seventeenth century that we observe their inclusion in elite cuisine, thanks to the Neapolitan recipe collection 
of Antonio Latini. Iberian influences may be detected in their adoption for culinary purposes, since various recipes that
call for tomatoes are designated as "in the Spanish style." Among these is a recipe for "tomato sauce," which is flavored with
onions and wild thyme "or piperna" and subsequently adjusted to taste by adding salt, oil, and vinegar. With a few
modifications, this preparation was to enjoy a remarkable future in Italian cuisine and in the industry of preserved foods. The
custom observed in ancient and medieval times, as well as during the Renaissance, of serving sauces as accompaniments to 
"boiled foods or other dishes"--as Latini expresses it in this instance--facilitated the acceptance of the tomato by 
integrating it into an established gastronomic tradition. For the same reason, it gained widespread ocurrence in 
Italian cooking in the eighteenth and nineteenth cneturies. Panunto in Tuscany, Vincenzo Corrado in Naples, and Francesco
Leonardi in Rome all include it in their recipe books."<br>
---<i>Italian Cuisine: A Cultural History</i>, Alberto Capatti & Massimo Montanari [Columbia University Press:New York] 1999 (p. 42-3)
<p>
"Despite the current enthusiasm for tomatoes in Italy, Spain and the rest of southern Europe, they
were not well received upon arrival from the New World in the sixteenth century. Looking and
smelling much like their poisonous relatives in the Solanaceae family it is not surprising that few
people tried to eat them. They were usually grown as ornamental flowers, and only described
botanically in Mattioli's <i>Commentaries on Dioscordes</i> in 1544. Although wealthy diners
would not eat tomatoes, it does appear that their poorer neighbors had begun to eat them out of
necessity. Good evidence of this can be found in 1650 in Melchior Sebizius' On the Faculty of
Foods in which he writes that they are so cold and moist that they must be cooked with pepper,
salt and oil, but "our cooks abosolutely reject them, even though they grow easily and copiously
in gardens." The first published cookbook recipes including tomatoes appeared in Naples at the
very end of the seventeenth century in Antonio Latini's <i>Lo Scalo all a Moderna</i>."<br>

<b>Tomatoes in North America</b><br>
"...English herbalist William Salmon...In 1687...he left for the New World...He traveled to New England and the Caribbean 
and practiced medicione in South Carolina...During the early years of the eighteenth century, he began working on his major
work, <i>Botanologia</i>; he completed it in 1710. In an early section of the herbal, Salmon revealed that he had seen tomatoes
growing in Carolina, which was in 'the South-East part of Florida.' As strange as this may seem today, his geography was
accurate because the term <i>Florida</i> then referred to what is now the eastern part of the United States. This is the first
known reference to the tomato in the British North American colonies. Several different theories have been espoused to account for
the presence of tomatoes in the Carolinas. The most likely explanation is that there were multiple introductions by different
peoples at different times for different purposes. The Spanish, who had probably cultivated and consumed tomatoes in their
settlements in Florida earlier in the seventeenth century, had established colonies and missions...It is probable that the 
Spanish introduced tomatoes into what is today Georgia and the Carolinas. Alternatively, as gardeners grew tomatoes in 
Europe, French Huguenot refugees and British colonists may have brought seeds directly from the Caribbean...Whatever the initial
source, tomatoes were cultivated in the Carolinas by the mid-eighteenth century...Only one colonial cookery manuscript is known to
have contained a tomato recipe...author <a href="foodsauces.html#horrytomatoes">Harriott Pinckney Horry</a>...From the southern states, tomatoes spread northward...Beginning in the late 
eighteenth century, cookbooks and agricultural books published in Philadelphia contained references to tomatoes...the earliest
primary source pinpointing the tomato in New Jersey was George Perot Macculloch's farm journal, which noted the planting of 
tomatoes from 1829 onward in Morristown...In Massachusetts, tomatoes were introduced in the late eighteenth century."<br>

<b>About tomatoes in China</b><br>
"Solanaceous fruits are in part a natural group in Chinese. Eggplant...has the most respectable antiquity, introduced from
India at some obscure time in the past...Tomatoes...were introduced from the West in the 1500s and promptly
named fan chieh (barbarian eggplant), their similarity to eggplants noted from the start. At first tomatoes were grown only for
Westerners near the coastal enclaves where they stayed, but its taste and ease of growth achieved popularity for the tomato
eventually, and it continues to spread and become more widely accepted in cooking. At present, however, it is still primarily
a part of urbanized Cantonese cuisine--the area that has been longest and most intimately in contact with foreigners."<br>

<b>Grape tomatoes</b><br>
Grape tomatoes were introduced to the American market in the late 1990s. The "Santa" variety is
most popular. Grape tomatoes are popular because (unlike the cherry tomato)
they are truly "bite sized." This convenience appeals to efficient salad makers. 
<p>
<b>Who introduced grape tomatoes to the USA?</b><br>
The brand name "Grape tomato" is generally attributed to Andrew Chu, Chu Farms, Wimauma Florida. Origin accounts differ
slightly:
<p>

"The grape tomato landed in Chu's lap in 1996 when a Taiwanese friend gave him some seeds and challenged him to grow the uniquely sweet crop. He planted 2
 acres and sold the produce in the farmer's market on Hillsborough Avenue. 
Word spread. The next year he planted 40 acres. In 1998, he abandoned the Chinese greens and filled all 200 acres in Wimauma with grape tomatoes."<br>
---"From a Tiny Tomato A Giant Success," Janet Zink, <i>St. Petersburg Times</i> [FL], November 7, 2003 (p. 6)
<p>
"Andrew Chu, a vegetable grower in Wimauma, Fla., first heard about a grape-shaped variety of cherry tomato in 1996. A Taiwanese friend and specialty produce wholesaler in New York asked Chu to try them, thinking they might appeal to Asian shoppers; they were already being grown in mainland China. 
So Chu sent away for the hybrid seeds from Known-You Seed Co., Ltd., in Taiwan. He planted his first crop in the fall of 1996. Asians bought the grape-shaped tomatoes, but the market was limited, says Chu. 
"I started thinking about taking them mainstream," he says. So in 1997, Chu Farms packed them up in pint-size plastic clamshells, and shipped them through its 
regular distributors to the East Coast."<br> 
---"Attack of the Grape Tomatoes," Carole Sugarman, <i>Washington Post</i>, September 12, 2001 (p. F1)
<p>
"The short history of grape tomatoes starts in 1994, when Florida farmer Andrew Chu began experimenting with the seed--received from a friend in Taiwan--on his
Chu Farms in Wimauma, south of St. Petersburg. The seeds, from the Known-You Co., consistently produced tomatoes with a high level of sugar. With their crimson color, oval shape
and size--slightly smaller than cherry tomatoes--they were like nothing else on the market."<br>
---"Growers Sour Over Grape Tomatoes," Associated Press, <i>Daily News-Record</i> [Hrrisonburg VA] July 29, 2004 (p. 20)
<p>
"We talked by phone to Andy Chu of Chu Farms at Wimauma, Fla. (south of Tampa), who grows, packages and sells "the original grape tomatoes." He has 
160 acres of the Santa variety. He discovered the tomatoes in Mexico, got a Chinese wholesaler to get the seeds for him and began growing them in 1997. 
"Many people are growing them now," he says. Chu Farms ships the grape tomatoes by truck all over the country. 
The plants are easy to grow, he says. When he couldn't get seeds, he had a laboratory, West Winds Technology in Athens, Tenn., do tissue cultures to start plants for him, so East Tennessee is a location he's visited frequently. 
Asked about their popularity, he says they are sweeter, less watery and easier to eat in one bite than cherry tomatoes. His favorite way of eating them is as a 
snack."<br>

<b>Compteting claims</b><br>
"Before long commercial growers such as Six L's and Procacci Bros. got a taste of the fruit and realized Chu was on to something. "I've been in business 53 years and I recognized their potential," says Joe Procacci, chief executive officer of Procacci Bros., who first saw the sweet tomatoes at Chu's initial three-acre plot. He and other growers imported the seeds -- a variety called Santa -- and started planting. 
In 1998, Chu applied for a federal trademark for the name "grape tomatoes." He says he figured that if his product gained name recognition, it would be harder for other growers to enter the market: They'd be at a disadvantage if they had to call the tomatoes something else. 
Procacci says he applied for a trademark for the term even before Chu -- and that both of them were rejected by the Patent and Trademark Office. Chu then
applied and received what's called a "supplemental registration" for the name, meaning that he acquired some limited trademark rights and got a leg up on getting full
 trademark protection. But it did not prevent other companies from using the term; in fact, by that time, it was being used on at least 25 labels in the United States, 
according to the Packer, a trade industry newspaper that covered the controversy."<br>

"Grape tomatoes are the hot item in the supermarket produce section. They're roughly the size of seedless green grapes-hence their name-and are sold by the pint
 for $1.99 or more. Many folks agree they're pretty tasty. So why not grow your own? That may be difficult, at least this year. 
For one thing, there's no tomato variety called "grape." (In catalogs that word typically refers to how some tomatoes grow in clusters.) Ag-Mart Produce of Plant

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Worcestershire sauce</b></font><br>

Spicy sauces based on anchovies date to Ancient Roman <a href="foodsauces.html#garum"">garum & liquamen</a>. English sauces
expanded on this culinary tradition, offering dozens of variations through the years. Most notably: anchovy sauce,
essence of anchovy, fish sauce, Quin's sauce and Worcester/Worcestershire sauce. The components are generally the same:
anchovies, shallots, ketchups, and cayenne. Proportions vary slightly. 
<p>
Commerical Worcestershire sauce first surfaces in
<a href="http://www.worcestercitymuseums.org.uk/mag/spirit/spsauce.htm">1830</a>. The original company also produced 
"Quinine Wine," and anti-malarial.<a href="foodsauces.html#quinsauce">Quin's Sauce</a> surfaces the same year. Who or what was Quin? 
Dr. John Kitchener's notes posit "Quin" as an epciure and wise sauce maker.
The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> confirms the word "quins" (no apostrophy) could mean queen or strumpet.
Was this piquant sauce named for a saucy woman? Or, was it a shortened version of "Quintessence of Anchovy?" 
<br>
<blockquote>
<b>[1747]<br>
"To make Anchovy Sauce.</b><br>
Take a pint of Gravy, put in an Anchovy, take a Quarter of a Pound of Butter rolled in a little Flour, stir all together until it
boils. You may add a little Juice of Lemon, Ketchup, Red Wine, and Wallnut Liquor, just as you please. Plain Butter melted thick, with a
Spoonful of Walnut-Pickle, or Ketchup, is good Sauce, or Anchovy: In short, if you put as many Things as you fancy into

(p. 278) <br>
[NOTE: Kitchener appends this note to his recipe for Quintessense of Anchovy (No. 433) "Epicure Quin used to say, 'Of all the banns of marriage I ever
heard, none gave me half such pleasure as the union of delicate Ann-Chovy with good John-Dory." (p. 281), see next.]
<p>
<b>"Quintessence of Anchovy.(No. 433.)</b><br>
The goodness of this preparation depends almost entirely on having fine mellow fish, that have been in pickle long enough (i. e. about twelve months) to dissolve easily, yet are not at all rusty.
Choose those that are in the state they come over in, not such as have been put into fresh pickle, mixed with red paint,280-* which some add to improve the complexion of the fish; it has been said, that others have a trick of putting anchovy liquor on pickled sprats;280- you will easily discover this by washing one of them, and tasting the flesh of it, which in the fine anchovy is mellow, red, and high-flavoured, and the bone moist and oily. Make only as much as will soon be used, the fresher it is the better.
Put ten or twelve anchovies into a mortar, and pound them to a pulp; put this into a very clean iron, or silver, or very well tinned saucepan; then put a large table-spoonful of cold spring-water (we prefer good vinegar) into the mortar; shake it round, and pour it to the pounded anchovies, set them by the side of a slow fire, very frequently stirring them together till they are melted, which they will be in the course of five minutes. Now stir in a quarter of a drachm of good Cayenne pepper (No. 404). and let it remain by the side of the fire for a few minutes longer; then, while it is warm, rub it through a hair-sieve,280- with the back of a wooden spoon.
The essence of anchovy, which is prepared for the committee of taste, is made with double the above quantity of water, as they are of opinion that it ought to be so thin as not to hang about the sides of the bottle; when it does, the large surface of it is soon acted upon by the air, and becomes rancid and spoils all the rest of it.
A roll of thin-cut lemon-peel infused with the anchovy, imparts a fine, fresh, delicate, aromatic flavour, which is very grateful; this is only recommended when you make sauce for immediate use; it will keep much better without: if you wish to acidulate it, instead of water make it with artificial lemon-juice (No. 407*), or add a little of Coxwells concrete acid to it.
[281]Obs.The above is the proper way to perfectly dissolve anchovy,281-* and to incorporate it with the water; which, if completely saturated, will continue suspended.
To prevent the separation of essence of anchovy, and give it the appearance of being fully saturated with fish, various other expedients have been tried, such as dissolving the fish in thin water gruel, or barley-water, or thickening it with mucilage, flour, &c.: when any of these things are added, it does not keep half so well as it does without them; and to preserve it, they overload it with Cayenne pepper.
Mem.You cannot make essence of anchovy half so cheap as you can buy it. Thirty prime fish, weighing a pound and a quarter, and costing 4s. 6d., and two table-spoonfuls of water, made me only half a pint of essence; you may commonly buy that quantity ready-made for 2s., and we have seen an advertisement offering it for sale as low as 2s. 6d. per quart.
It must be kept very closely stopped; when you tap a bottle of sauce, throw away the old perforated cork, and put in a new taper velvet cork; if the air gets to it, the fish takes the rust,281- and it is spoiled directly.
Essence of anchovy is sometimes coloured281- with bole armeniac, Venice red, &c.; but all these additions deteriorate the flavour of the sauce, and the palate and stomach suffer for the gratification of the eye, which, in culinary concerns, will never be indulged by the sagacious gourmand at the expense of these two primum mobiles of his pursuits.
*** Essence of anchovy is sometimes made with sherry or Madeira wine, or good mushroom catchup (No. 439), instead of water. If you like the acid flavour, add a little citric acid, or dissolve them in good vinegar.
N.B. This is infinitely the most convenient way of using anchovy, as each guest may mix sauce for himself, and make it strong or weak, according to his own taste.
It is also much more economical, as plain melted butter (No. 256) serves for other purposes at table."<br>
