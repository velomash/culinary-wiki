<font color="#003366"><b>What is pudding?</b></font><br>
The history of pudding is a complicated topic. Why? Though time, many different kinds of foods
have been known by this name. The creamy, rich pudding dessert we (Americans) think of today
is more closely related to custard. The history of custard is likewise
ancient. This food followed a separate, though parallel,  path that managed to converge with
pudding in 19th century America. 
<p>
Food historians generally agree the first puddings made by ancient cooks produced foods 
similar to sausages. The British claim <a href="foodpuddings.html#britishpudding">pudding</a> as part of their culinary heritage.
Medieval puddings (<a href="foodpuddings.html#blood">black</a> and <a
href="http://www.lewis-clark.org/bison/bison_recipe.htm">white</a>) were still mostly
meat-based. 17th
century English puddings were either savory (meat-based) or sweet (flour, nuts & sugar) and
were typically boiled in special pudding bags. The <a href="foodpuddings.html#pease">"pease porridge"</a> most
of us know from the old
nursery rhyme was most likely a simple boiled pudding of pease meal. By the latter half 18th
century
traditional English puddings no longer included meat. 19th century puddings were still boiled but
the finished product was more like cake. These puddings are still traditionally served at 
Christmas time. <a href="christmasfood.html#plumpudding">Plum pudding</a> (aka Christmas pudding)is a prime example. 
Modern steamed puddings decend from this tradition. 
<p>
About custard? Ancient Roman cooks recognized the binding properties of eggs. They were
experts at creating several egg-based dishes, most notably patinae, crustades and omlettes. These
foods were either savory (made with cheese, meat, pepper etc.) or sweet (flavored with honey,
nuts, cinnamon etc.). Food historians generally agree that custard, the sweet almost pudding-like
substance we Americans know today, dates to the Middle ages. At that time custard was eaten
alone or used as fillings for pies, tarts, pastry, etc. <a
href="foodpuddings.html#flan"> Flan</a> is probably the the most
famous and widely adapted custard dessert in the world. It is
important to note that custard was not unique to Europe. Similar recipes flourished in Asia.
<p>
The distinction between European custard and American pudding became muddled sometime in
the
1840s. At that time in America, traditional boiled puddings were no longer necessary to feed the
average family. There was plenty of food. This also happened to be the same time when Alfred
Bird, an English chemist,  introduced
custard
powder as an
alternative to egg thickeners. It wasn't long before Americans began
using custard powder and other cornstarch derivatives as thickeners for custard-type desserts.
This proved quite useful for overlander (conestoga wagon) cooks who did not have ready access
to a reliable supply of fresh eggs. 
<p>
<a name="chocolatepudding">
<b>Chocolate pudding & custard</b><br>
The earliest print reference we find for chocolate pudding is <a href="foodpuddings.html#1730chocolatepudding">1730</a>. Chocolate custard, a thick creamy cousin, 
dates to the 19th century. These sweets were enjoyed by wealthy people. In the last decades of the 19th century some American social reformers and food companies
endeavored to promote these products as health food. American custards and puddings converged
and were thusly marketed for their nutritional benevolence with special emphasis on invalids and
children.  
<p>
Some pudding-type foods have been considered healthy since ancient times. Case in point: <a
href="foodpuddings.html#rice">rice pudding</a>. This ancient recipe was traditionally prescribed for the
young and infirm. The formulae were inscribed in medical texts before the showed up in cookbooks.
<a href="foodpuddings.html#tapioca">Tapioca</a>, arrowroot, and cornstarch puddings (made from new world
thickeners) were also recommended as restoratives.

<a name="britishpudding">
<b>The origin & evolution of British puddings:</b><br>
"To focus attention on British usage (of the word pudding) is legitimate, since pudding may be claimed as a British invention,
and is certainly a characteristic dish of British cuisine...It seems that the ancestor of the term was the Latin word botellus, meaning
sausage, from which came boudin and also pudding. Puddings in all their variety and glory may be seen as the multiple 
descendants of a Roman sausage. The Haggis, by its nature and the ways it is prepared, illuminates the connection. In the
Middle Ages the black pudding (blood sausages) was joined by the white pudding, which was also made in a sausage skin, or sometimes
a stomach lining...White pudding was almost completely cereal in composition, usually containing a suet and breadcrumb mixture.
It was variously enriched and flavoured, and there were sweet versions. In diverging from these origins English cooks found 
two paths which could be taken to advance pudding cookery. The first was to take advantage of th fact that by the 16th 
century many ordinary houses had small ovens built into the chimney breast, or at the side of the main bread oven where there
was one. These ovens were not very hot. It was possible to bake a white pudding mixture or a cereal pottage slowly enough to suit
it. Often, it was enclosed in pastry...this path led to baked puddings. The second path involved finding a different 
container to replace the gut used for sausages...The breakthrough came when the pudding-cloth was invented, around the beginning
of the 17th century...During the 18th century, suet mixtures were joined by the first sponge puddings, and boiled and baked batters
became common. Sweet puddings included all kinds of fruits, jam, spices, meringue, and other delicacies. Plain puddings remained
important. Among savoury types, the first beef steak and mutton puddings appeared. Sweet milk pottages made with cereals such as
rice or barley persisted. As new kinds of starchy product began to be imported...these were also adopted for that purpse...The
disappearance of domestic servants in the 20th century brought further changes. The pudding-cloth was found to be difficult for 
housewives...boiled pudding were now almost made in basins covered with greased paper and foil and steamed partly immersed in 
water. Thus did the British steamed pudding come fully into its own. Roll-shaped puddings were either converted to basin format or
baked in specially made tubular tins."<br>

<a name="bakewell">
<font color="#003366"><b>Bakewell pudding</b></font><br>
19th century Bakewell pudding (sometimes called Bakewell tart) descends from Medieval egg enriched custards which, in turn,  descend from Ancient
Roman <a href="foodpuddings.html#flan">Flan</a>. Prehistory <a href="bakewell.pdf">here</a>. Bakewell is named for a place in Derbyshire England, not a description of the 
product. Or is it?

<p>
"Bakewell Tart, or Bakewell pudding, as it was originally called (tart seems to be an early twentieth-century alteration), appeared on the scene in the mid-nineteenth century. The first 
recorded 
reference to is was made by Eliza Acton (in her <i>Modern Cookery</i>, 1845)...Its basic concept...of a 
layer of jam beneath a main filling, was far from new then; it is part of a long tradition of so-called 
transparent' puddings, in which a layer of jam, preserved fruit, or candied peel was overlaid with a 
sugar, egg, and butter mixture and baked. They were made with or without a pastry case--and 
indeed Eliza Acton's recipe for Bakewell pudding makes no mention of pastry...The characteristic 
feature of Bakewell puddings, as opposed to all other puddings, was and is almonds. Originally they 
were introduced in the form of a few drips of almond essence in the overlaying sugar, egg, and 
butter mixture, but gradually it became the custom to use ground almonds, thereby radically altering 
the nature and consistency of the topping. The dish is of course named after Bakewell, a town in 
Derbyshire, but how this came about it not known. Legend (and probably no more than that) has it 
that the pudding was created by accident in the kitchens of the Rutland Arms in the centre of 
town." <br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 16-7) 
<p>
"Bakewell tart...was always known as a pudding until the 20th century...Medieval precursors date 
back to the 15th cnetury and were called flathons'...There were two main kinds. One was filled with 
a sweet, rich egg custard over a layer of candied fruit on the pastry shell. A second version was 
originally made without eggs, butter, or milk, and was a Lenten flathon; the filling was of ground 
almonds and sugar made into a liquid paste and flavoured with spices. In the succeeding centuries 
names such as 'egg tart' and 'almond tart' came into use. The name Bakewell pudding' first occurs in 
Meg Dods (1826), referring to the custard version; but thereafter the name was used for both. The 
recipe for Bakewell Pudding given by Eliza Acton (1845) was essentially a rich custard of egg yolks, 
butter, sugar, and flavouring...poured over a layer of mixed jams an inch...thick and baked...During 
the latter part of the 19th century the custard version fell into disuse, and the recipe evolved 
towards its modern forms....There are now two principal versions. One is the pudding' recognized by 
the inhabitants of Bakewell...The other current version is a shortcrust case with a filling of 
something like almond sponge cake over a layer of jam." <br>

<p>
"Bakewell Pudding. One should not apparently refer to Bakewell tart, but to Bakewell pudding, according to local pastry cooks and restaurateurs. I had always understood, from <i>Good 
Things in England</i>, that first bible of our regional cookery, that the original Bakewell tart/pudding did not contain ground almonds at all, but was closer to the rich custard of butter and 
eggs still favoured in Rouen for mirliton tarts. Such things are a warning to the dogmatic: food changes with time to suit different tastes., and where they are an improvement we should 
be receptive to the differences. I must confess that I do prefer Bakewell pudding with ground almonds, but you may leave them out if you wish to be more authentic and make the kind of
 thing Jane Austen may have tasted when she stayed in the inn at Bakewell." <br>

<a name="haggis">
<font color="#003366"><b>The Haggis</b></font><br>
Culinary historians generally agree that the recipe/method for making haggis can be traced to the
ancient Greeks and Romans.  These recipes were likely brought to the British Isles by the Romans
and adapted to local ingredients. The earliest Scottish recipes for haggis were printed in the early
15th century.  There are also many conflicting theories regarding the naming of haggis (see notes
below). 
<a href="http://www.rabbie-burns.com/the_haggis/">Gie her a Haggis!</a>, Robert Burns <i>Ode to Haggis</i> is the
bard's traditional birthday food on January 25th. 

<p>
"Haggis <br>
often regarded as the national dish and exclusive property of Scotland, is the archtype of a group
of dishes which have an ancient history and a wide distribution. All of them are relatively large
parcels of offal mixed with cereal and enclosed in some suitable wrapping from an animal's
entrails, usually the stomach. The concept of haggis is based on preservation. When the animal
was slaughtered, the perishable offal had to be eaten at once or preserved in some way. Salted,
packed into a stomach, and boiled, its keeping time was extended to a couple of weeks...The first
people known to have made products of the haggis type were the Romans, who were notably
interested in foods of the sausage family...The Scottish haggis may be an entirely indignenous
invention, but in the absense of written records there is now way of knowing; it could be an
adaptation of a Roman recipe to the local mutton and oats. The classic recipe, which has remained
almost unaltered since a very early date, uses the large stomach of a sheep filled with the minced
lungs, liver, and heart, plus fat, oatmeal, stock, salt, and pepper."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
365)
<p>
"...mesolithic Britons had neither pottery nor metal vessels in which to cook their meat...The flesh
would have to be cooked warm from the kill, as was the practice among German tribes of the first
century AD. When this was not possible, long hanging would have been necessary to break down
the connective tissue and tenderize the meat, and it would have been eaten high, as is still the case
with game. Animal heads, offal and blood would not have been wasted. The gut, used as a
container for liver, [lungs] and brains, cut up and mixed with fat, could be roasted slowly in the
embers. Homer described this type of cookery in the Odyssey, and it is found almost universally
among primitive peoples. In Britain the haggis was still a regular food in the Middle Ages; and in
remote highland areas it survived until modern times."<br>
---<i>Food and Drink in Britain: From the Stone Age to the 19th Century</i>, C. Anne Wilson
[Academy Chicago:Chicago] 1991 (p. 61)
<p>
"Made of suet, spices, onions, oatmeal and a sheep's pluck - heart, liver and lights
-boiled in a sheep's stomach, haggis is a form of sausage that seems to generate violent passions
and arouses both reverence and mirth among the Scots, who have been eating it for at least 400
years. ...The origin of haggis, as with many other national dishes, is obscure. A similar dish was
known to the ancient Greeks and Romans and is mentioned in some 14th-century Scottish
chronicles. Dr. Michael Krause, a physician from Hamburg who recently tasted it for the first
time, reported that it was much like a Silesian dish he called ''derma.'' And although haggis
includes pork fat or suet, its taste and texture also resemble the Jewish dish made of chicken fat,
flour, spices and onions baked in a steer's intestines that is also called derma....The French honor
its Scottish connections by calling it ''Pudding de St. Andre'' although, in fact, the word haggis is
probably French in origin and comes from the verb hacher - to chop up or mangle. Though
unproven, the French origin seems likely as French influence was strong in Scotland until 1603
and other traces of that tongue remain in the Scottish lexicon. A leg of lamb is called gigot and a
serving dish is an ashet - assiette in French."<br>
---Fare of the Country: Haggis History and Humor, <i>New York Times</i>, January 5, 1986
(section 10, p. 12)
<p>
<b>THE NAMING OF HAGGIS</b>
<p>
"Haggis...The analogy of most terms of cookery suggests a French source; but not corresponding
French word or form has been found. The conjecture that is represents French hachis 'hash'. with
assimilation to hag, hack, to chop, has apparmently no basis of fact; French hachis is not known
so early, and the earlier forms of the English word are more remote from it. Whether the word is
connected with have vb., evidence does not show." <br>
---<i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, 2nd edition, Volume IV (p. 1013-4)<br>
[NOTE: the OED traces the first use of this word in print to 1420]
<p>
"Haggis...The name probably comes from the verb haggen (to hack), although some authorities
suggest that it is derived from the words au gui l'an neuf (mistletoe for the New Year), the cry of
the mistletoe sellers in the Middle Ages, possibly by a vague memory of ancient Druidic
ceremonies."<br>
---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, Completely Revivised and Updated [Clarkson Potter:New
York] 2001(p. 592)

"Haggis...It is considered peculiarly a Scottish dish, but was common in England till the 18th
century. The derivation of the word is obscure. The French hachis, English "hash," is of later
appearance than "haggis." It may be connected with a verb "to hag,"  meaning to cut in small
pieces, and would then be cognate ultimately with "hash."<br>

Black pudding (also known as blood pudding, boudin noir, <a href="foodpuddings.html#kiszka">kiszka</a>) traces its roots to ancient fresh sausages composed of
pig's blood mixed with thickeners. <a href="foodpuddings.html#bloodpuddingrecipes">Recipes evolved</a> according to culture and cuisine. 
Where and when were the first blood puddings made? Jean-Francois Revel credits Ancient Greece: "Aphtonitas, the inventor

<b>What is black pudding?</b><br>
"Black pudding is a sausage...made from pig's blood with some thickening agent, such as cereal,
and spices. Its name--a reference to the darkened colour of the cooked blood--is of long
standing...The synonymous blood pudding is equally ancient, but nowadays much less usual. In
England, the Midlands and the North are the great areas of black pudding appreciation; Bury in
Lancashire is often claimed as the black pudding capital. But black puddings form an essential part
of the basic peasant cuisine of many other European countries...Elsewhere in Europe a black
pudding is a blutwurst (Germany) or a kashanka (Poland)."<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p.

<p>
"Blood sausages, sausages filled with blood, with cereal or other vegetable matter to absorb this,
and fat. The most familiar type is the black pudding or boudin noir, English and French terms for
much the same thing. It is pudding in the old sense of something enclosed in a sausage skin. The
black pudding is probably the most ancient of sausages or puddings. Some would claim this
distinction for haggis, but the earliest mention in literature is of something tending more towards
black pudding, at least in its filling. Book 18 of Homer's Odyssey, around 1000 BC, refers to a
stomach filled with blood and fat and roasted over a fire. The reason of such dishes is clear
enough. Whe a pig is killed it is bled, and a large amount of blood becomes available. This has a
very short keeping time if not preserved. Putting it into one of the vessels which the entrails of
animals conveniently furnish, along with other offal with a limited keeping time, is an obvious
solution. The oldest detailed recipe for black pudding, in the compilation attributed to Apicus
(material of the first few centuries AD), calls for lengths of intestine, rather than a stomach, as the
container. It is a rich recipe with no cereal, but chopped hard-boiled egg yolks, pine kernels,
onions, and leeks. Common black puddings of the time were probably made with cereal. In
medieval Europe it was not unusual for even relatively poor families to own a pig, which was
slaughtered in the autumn. Black puddings were therefore made everywhere."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxfod] 1999 (p.
82)<br>
[NOTE: This book generally describes several methods for making blood sausage/pudding.]
<p>
"Sausages were also a great favourite; indeed from Greek times they appeared to have been a
staple of the kitchen in all coutnries. Perhaps the reason lies in their economical way of using all
the odd bits of the carcass and once well seasoned, moistend with tasty fat, the smoking and
drying intensifying the flavour; they become an addiction in a country's food, reflecting the tastes
of a region in their use of particular flavourings. Some aspects of the Roman Lucanian sausage
had remained with the Anglo-Saxons...This is a highly seasoned sausage with pepper, cumin,
savory, rue and mixed herbs packed into the cleaned intestine and then smoked...Late autumn was
the time to make black puddings, which became a delicacy to be eaten on feast days. There could
be puddings of porpoise, mixed with oatmeal, seasoning and blood, or of capon's neck where the
stuffing was forced into the neck then roasted with the bird...How much spice was used in recipes
must have been a personal choice partly dictated by economics."<br>
---<i>British Food: An Extraordinary Thousand Years of History</i>, Colin Spencer [Columbia
University Press:New York] 2002 (p. 90)
<p>
"When the pig was killed black puddings were...a great mainstay of the [Medieval] peasant
kitchen and would remain so for the next 600 years. Out of the annual pig killing came such
dishes as brawn, souse--the ears, cheeks, snout and trotters a pickled in brine or ale--as well as the
puddings, enjoyed as festive food around Christmastide."<br>
---ibid (p. 94)
<p>
"Much of Roman cookery was highly spiced; and nowhere were the spices more prominent than
in the sausages and black puddings of the period. Made usually in the cleaned intestine or caul
(omentum) of pig, sheept or goat, they were a sophisticated development of the more primitive
haggis. Some were produced for immediate eating, but others were smoked a long while above
the hearth before they came to table...The tradition of sausage making lingered on in northern
Europe after the end of the western Roman empire. The Anglo-Saxons developed their own
versions. Although their recipes have not survived Lucanian sausages appear in a Latin and
Anglo-Saxon vocabulary as part of a list of pig products...The Norman Conquest brought the
sausage varieties of Norman-French cookery into English cuisine...Sausages were made from the
lean pork; and black puddings from the animal's blood. The town cookshops often sold sausages
and black puddings, and at least sometimes tainted meat was used in their manufacture. The best
and also the safest were those made at home...Black puddings were also made at pig-killing time
and the favourite season for this was late autumn. The animal's blood was blended with minced
onions and diced fat, spiced with ginger, cloves and a little pepper, and stuffed into lengths of
intestine. The puddings could be kept for up to three days, and were boiled in water before being
eaten. In Britain puddings, rich with blood, fat and spcies, became quite a delicacy, to be eaten on
high days and holidays. The word pudding, morever, soon took on a wider meaning than that of
blood-sausage, and came to be associated with the idea of stuffing of any kind...The puccing of
porpoise was a dish for the nobility. The pig was the source of puddings for common folk.  Take
the blood of the swine, and swing it, then put thereto minced onions largely with salt, and the suet
of the god minced', begins an Elizabethan recipe...[Early modern period] Both black
blood-puddings and sausages continued to be made from the traditional ingredients...Both black
and
white puddings were well liked in Tudor and Stuart times..."<br>

<p>
Brid Mahon's <i>Land of Milk and Honey: The Story of Traditional Irish Food and Drink</i>
offers these notes on Celtic traditions:
<p>
"Most households killed a pig at certain times of the year, and in the more substantial farms seeral
pigs were usually killed on the same day. Certain superstitions were once observed regarding the
time of killing. A pig should never be killed unless there was a letter R in the month, which meant
in effect that pigs were seldom slaughtered during the summer months. In the counties of Mayo
and Galway it was believed that killing should take place under a full moon. If the animal was
killed when the moon was waning the meat would reduce in size, while if the killing was doen
when the moon was waxing or full the meat would increase. Killing the pig was an important
social occasion, for it meant full and plenty for all. Each neighbour who came to help with the pig
killing brought a handful of salt for the curing, and when the work eas done each would get a
share of the puddings and the fresh pork. The slaughtering was done by the men, but it was the
women who were responsible for curing and smoking the hams and bacons...Whe the pig was
killed the blood was collevted in a vessel and used to make black puddings. In Ring, Co
Waterford, they described the old method used: 
<p>
Long ago when they killed pigs they kept the intestines to make puddings. They washed them
clear in a running stream and they were left to soak in spring water overnight. The casings were
cut into fifteen inch lengths, tied at one end. Salt, lard, oatmeal, finely chopped onions, spices,
peppers and cloves, together with a cup of flour were mixed with the pig's blood which had been
collected in a bucket. Each pudding was three-quarters filled and tied at the end. It was dropped
into a pot half-filled with water which had been brought to simmering point, cooked for about an
hour, then taken up, allowed to cool, and divided amongst the neighbours. This was always done.
When needed for use puddings were fried in a pan." <br>

<b>Kiszka: Polish Blood Pudding</b><br>
Blood sausages and puddings such as Polish kiszka have ancient roots. According to the food
historians, pork products of various sorts were very popular in medieval Poland:
<p>
"In medieval Poland, two distinct
types of pigs were raised for general consumption and there were doubtless a number of
gradations between the two extremes. The first was called the "great swine," a healf-wild, half-domesticated razorback 
often illustrated in medieval manuscripts. The other--small, mean, and
not easily domesticated--was known in Polish as "swamp hog"...Archaeological evidence
confirms the high proportion of pork in the Polish diet at this time [1380]...Specific pork
products mentioned in period texts include scoldre or soldre (ham), salsucia (sausage), and
farcimina (blood pudding or blood sausage--called kiszka in modern Polish). Blood sausage was
introduced to Poland before A.D. 1000 from German-speaking areas. It is known that beer was
supplied to the royal kitchens for the purpose of preparing a blood soup called czernina or juszka
in old Polish and referred to as iusculum in Latin. Blood from ducks, geese, and pigs was
used...The farcimina, according to Szymon Syrennius's discussion in connection with millet
kaska, "are used for stuffing blood sausages of pork and beef, having first been cooked in the fat.
Farcimina appears in much earliers sources in a similar context, so there is little doubt as to what
is meant by it. Similar sausages using various tupes of grain stuffings are still made in Poland
today...Regarding methods of preparation, fried pork mush have been popular because Polish
texts often mention frying pans."<br>

<b>English translation of above recipe:</b><br>
"Item, to make black pudding, have the pig blood collected in a fair basin or pan, and when you intend to see your pig destroyed, have the lights washed very well and put on to cook, and as soon as it is cooked, take from the bottom of the pan the sticky lumps of blood and take them out; and then, have onions peeled and chopped to the amount of half the blood, with the amount of half the suet which is among the guts, which is called the "entrecercle" of the guts, chopped as small as dice, together with a little ground salt, and throw it in the blood. Then, have ginger, clove, and a little pepper, and grind it all together. Then, have the small guts well washed, turned inside out and all blood removed in a running river, and to remove the dampness, have them placed in a pan on the fire, and stir; then, add salt; and do this a second time, and yet a third time: and then wash, and turn inside out and wash them, then place to dry on a towel; and squeeze and wring them to dry. (They say the "entrecercle" and these are the large guts which have suet inside which you get out with a knife). After you have added and adjusted by the right amounts and quantities, so that you have half as much onions as blood, and a quarter as much suet as blood, and then when your black puddings are filled with this, put them to cook in a pan in the water from the lights, and prick with a pin when they swell, or otherwise they will burst.
Note that the blood keeps well for two days, in truth for three, since the spices are inside. And some for spices, have pennyroyal, great savory, hyssop, marjoram, gathered when they are in flower and then dried, ground, for spices. And as for the lights, put in a copper pot to cook on the fire, complete and without salt, and put the
length of the groove (throat) outside the pot, so that the liquid may be skimmed; and when it is cooked, take it out and consider it for making soup.
To make black puddings with liver, take two pieces of liver, two pieces of lung, a piece of suet, and place in a gut with blood: and with the remainder as above.
Note that you can make nice black puddings from a goose, but it will be thin, and because of the thinness the guts are bigger than 
the suet."<br>

In <i>English Food</i>, Grigson instructs us how to select eat black puddings:
 "Black Puddings have to be chosen carefully unless you are lucky enough to live in Bury, Lancashire, where the best ones are
made. Many manufacturers put far too much barley and oatmeal with the blood and pork fat, which makes them stodgy by comparison, say,
with the delicious black puddings of France. To my way of thinking, the inside should remain soft and spicy when cooked; it should
never be dry or hard. The usual way is to slice black puddings and fry or grill them with bacon. I think they taste better when
cut into lengths, and fried with chopped bacon and chopped apple. Serve with mashed potato and mustard. Then they are really delcious."

<b>What is Yorkshire Pudding?</b><br>
"Yorkshire pudding is made from an egg, flour, and milk batter cooked in a very large shallow tin
containing
a layer of very hot beef dripping. It is a popular accompaniment to roast beef in Britain, and the
two together
compose the 'traditional' Sunday lunch. Sometimes the batter is poured into smaller, round tins to
make
individual pudings but this is not the authentic Yorkshire method. Strictly speaking, the pudding,
cut in
squares, should be served with gravy before the meat, to take the edge off the appetite. Batter
puddings
have a long history and exist in many forms, mostly sweet....Jennifer Stead...discusses the origin
and
development of the dish. Commenting on the localized attribtution of 'Yorkshire' attached to it,
she notes
that batter puddings were also known in the south of England; Yorkshire batter puddings appear
to have
been distinguished by their lightness and crispness. ..Such details had not escaped Hannah Glasse,
she
herself came from the North of England and who said that the dripping must boil before the batter
is
added....Yorkshire pudding was never eaten exlcusively with beef. The early recipe for batter
pudding
mentions mutton; indeed, it could be served with any roast meat..."<br>

"When wheat flour had come into common use for cakes and puddings, some economically
minded cooks
in the north of England devised a means of utilizing the fat that dropped into the dripping pan to
cook a
batter pudding while the meat roasted. In 1737 the recipe for 'A dripping pudding' was published
in The
<i>Whole Duty of a Woman</i>. 'Make a good batter as for pancakes; put in a hot toss-pan over
the fire
with a bit of butter to fry the bottom a little then put the pan and butter under a shoulder of
mutton, instead
of a dripping pan, keeping frequently shaking it by the handle and it will be light and savoury, and
fit to take
up when your mutton is enough; then turn it in a dish and serve it hot.' Similar instructions were
reproduced
by Hannah Glasse eight years later under the title of 'Yorkshire pudding'."<br>

How did  Roast Beef with Yorkshire Pudding make its way across America?
<p>
Generally, roast beef, Yorkshire pudding and the whole buffet of traditional European foods made
its way
across America with pioneers and settlers. People cook what they know. The first wave of
explorers (and
other portable groups such as Conestoga wagons groups, cowboys, and soldiers) adapated these
recipes
best they could to suit rudimentary cooking facilities. The second wave of settlers (and other
stationary
groups such as homesteaders, hotel keepers, boarding houses, etc.) enjoyed more elaborate
cooking
facilities and could do proper
justice to these recipes. As with all times and places, the more money you had, the better you ate.
Roast
beef and Yorkshire pudding would have been fare for the middle classes and wealthy.

<b>ABOUT POPOVERS</b><br>
Food historians generally agree popovers are an American recipe. They descended from 17th
century
batter puddings made in England. <a href="foodpuddings.html#yorkshirepudding">Yorkshire pudding</a> is the
most famous
example of these.
<p>
"Popover. A light, hollow muffin made from an egg batter similar to that used in making
Yorkshire pudding.
The name comes from the fact that the batter rises and swells of the muffin tin while baking...In
<i>American Food</i> (1974), Evan Jones writes: Settlers
from Maine who founded Portland, Oregon, Americanized the pudding from Yorkshire by
cooking the batter
in custard cups lubricated with drippings from the roasting beef (or sometimes pork); another
modification
was the use of garlic, and, frequently, herbs. The result is called Portland popover pudding,
individual
balloons of crusty meat-flavored pastry." Most popovers, however, are not flavored but merely
set in
buttered muffin tins. They are served a breakfast or with meats at lunch and dinner."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New
York] 1999 (p.

<p>
"Popover. An American favourite for breakfast and to accompany meat dishes, closely resembles
a small
Yorkshire pudding and is made with a similar batter (similar also to that used for pancakes).
Popovers are
baked in patty tins or custard cups in a hot oven. They earn their name (which first appeared in
print in
1876) by a tendency to swell over the sides of the tins or cups while they are being baked."<br>

<a name="custard">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Custard</b></font><br>
The history of custard is long and complicated. Ancient Roman cooks were the first to recognize
the binding properties of eggs. They were experts at creating several egg-based dishes, most
notably patinae, crustades and omlettes. These foods were either savory (made with cheese, meat,
pepper etc.) or sweet (flavored with honey, nuts, cinnamon etc.). 
<p>
Food historians generally agree that custard, the sweet almost pudding-like substance we
Americans know today, dates to the Middle ages. At that time custard was eaten alone or used as
fillings for pies, tarts, pastry, etc. <a href="foodfaq1.html#flan">
Flan</a> is probably the the most famous and widely adapted custard dessert in the world. It is
important to note that custard was not unique to Europe. Similar recipes flourished in Asia.
<p>
Classic recipes for sweet custards were introduced to America by European cooks. Culinary
evidence confirms American cooks readily embraced these recipes. Europeans also brought with
them pudding recipes, which were a very different kind of food at that time. 18th century
European puddings were typically boiled compositions of legumes, sometimes infused with meat
products. 
<p>
The distinction between European custard and American pudding got muddled sometime in the
1840s. At that time in America, traditional boiled puddings were no longer necessary to feed the
average family. There was plenty of food. This also happened to be the same time when Alfred
Bird, an English chemist,  introduced
<a href="foodpuddings.html#custardpowder">custard
powder</a> as an
alternative to egg thickeners. It wasn't long before Americans began
using custard powder and other cornstarch derivatives as thickeners for custard-type desserts.
This proved quite useful for overlander (conestoga wagon) cooks who did not have ready access
to a reliable supply of fresh eggs.
<p>
In the last decades of the 19th century some American social reformers and food companies
endeavored to tranform custard/pudding from dessert to health food. American custards and
puddings were thusly marketed for their nutritional benevolence with special respect to invalids
and children. Yes, this means chocolate pudding was perceived by some as a health food.  Late
19th century cookbooks and company brochures (Jell-0, Royal) were replete with "quick" custard
and pudding recipes, often touting arrowroot and tapicoca as the healthy ingredients. By the
1930s instant custard & <a href="foodpuddings.html#mixes">pudding mixes</a> were readily available to the
American public.
<p>
<b>This is what the food historians tell us about custard</b><br>
"Custard. A mixture of milk and eggs thickened by gentle heating, is a basic item of western
cooking and occurs in many dishes in either dominant or subsidiary role. In the vocabulary of the
French kitchen, there is no word for custard, and thus it is easy to forget the role that custard
mixtures play in things as diverse as <a
href="foodpies.html#quiche">quiche Lorraine</a> and <a
href="foodpies.html#eclairs">eclairs</a>.
The word used is creme, which...[has] other meanings; but see <a href="foodpuddings.html#creme">Creme caramel
and creme brulee</a> for connected subjects. Custard was much used in the Middle Ages as a
filling and a binder for other fillings in the flans and tarts which were highly popular at the time
and for long afterwards. That is how it got its name;  custard is derived from  crustade, a tart
wtih a crust...Two other medieval preparations, caudle and posset, have a history linked with that
of custard, and in some instances have virtually been custards. Although in their plainest for they
were drinks, they were often thickened to a fair degree of solidity...In the 16th century  fruit
creams' became popular. These were sweet made with cream, and pureed fruit. Early types of
fool were similar. During this time it became usually to make custards in dishes or individual cups
rather than in a pastry case. <br>

<a name="custardpowder">
<b>What is custard powder?</b><p>
"What is abundantly clear is the importance of...the invention of custard powder. This
product is not a dried form of real custard. It consists mainly of cornflour and sugar, coloured and
flavoured, to which hot milk is added to make a sauce. It was invented by Alfred Bird, who
opened a shop in Birmingham in 1837...Demand for Bird's product increased steadily during the
second half of the 19th century. Competitors, using formulae whose ingredients included arrowroot, sago flour, or 
potato starch, coloured with turmeric or chrome yellow, and flavoured with cassia or bitter almonds, also entered the market. 
Bird's, however, promoted their product with skilful salesmanship, and become so closely identified with custard powder that few
competitors survived. A principal factor in the success of custard powder was that, as it
did not contain eggs, there was no longer any risk of the sauce curdling..."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2nd edition 2007 (p.
237-8)

"...Alfred Bird experimented with a custard based on cornflour rather than eggs, to which his wife was allergic. And astute
businessman, he marketed the result, and in the ensuing century bright yellow custard made from custard pwoder colonized the
tables of Britian."<br>

<b>A sampling of custard recipes through time:</b><br>
<blockquote>
<b>[Medieval Italy]</b><br>
"Dariole, or Custard Tart</b><br>
Form the dough into the shape of a deep pie and fill it completely with flour so it will keep its
shape; cook it in a pan until it is somewhat dry. And when this is done, remove the flour and take
some egg yolk, milk, sugar, and cinnamon. When these things are made into a mixture, put it into
the pastry, cooking it like a tart, moving it frim time to time and stirring with a spoon. And when
you can see it starting to set, pour some rose water and stir well with a spoon. And when it has
set completely it is cooked. Note that is should not cook too much, and that is should quiver like

<a name="clafoutis">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Clafoutis</b></font><br>

"Clafoutis is a French batter pudding generously dotted with black cherries (or, in non-classic 
versions of the dish, other fruits). It is a particular specialty of the Limousin region of central 
France. The word is a derivative of the dialect verb clafir, fill'." <br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 79) 
<p
"Clafoutis. A specialty associated with the Limousin region of C. France. In its original form it is 
a custard or flan with numerous cherries (traditionally, the first red ones of the summer) 
embedded in it, the whole being baked in a large earthenware dish and served either hot or cold. 
There have been debates about the type of cherry to used and whether or not the fruits should be 
left with their stones in , as traditionalists recommend. Modern recipes often call for lining the 
dish with pastry, so that the end result looks more like a cherry tart than a true clafoutis. In the 
course of this century they clafoutis has gone from being a local preparation to national status as 
a popular dessert, and this has exposed it to experimental variations by innovative chefs. 
Although other fruits which are related to cherries, such as small plums and greengages, can 
legitimately be used in a clafoutis, the use of mangoes, for example, may be thought to be 
straying too far from the original." <br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 188) 
<p>
"Clafouti. This is a home-style recipe, even a rustic one, from the Limousin: it is a kind of flan or thick fruit crepe. In 
principle, clafouti is made with black cherries; but you can also use other fruits: black plumbs, mirabelles, greengage 
plums, etc. It is generally served warm, or rather lukewarm; but it is equally good cold. It is usually cooked in a tart pan made 
of thick metal and with serrated sides, which is one of the basic utensils of classic provincial kitchens. If you do not have 
a tart pan, you can use an ovenproof porcelain plate, in which the clafouti is served, cut into slices." <br>

<p>
Escoffier [Le Guide Culinaire 1903] does not include a recipe for clafoutis. The oldest recipe for 
this item we have on hand is from 1913: 
<blockquote>
<b>[1913] <r>
"Le clafoutis. </b><br>
C'est le plat populaire limousin, avec la bregaude...Pour le clafoutis, prenez trois oeufs,--et pour 
ces trois oeufs trois cuillerees de farine at autant de sucre en poudre. Une pincee de sel, trois 
quarts de litre de lait. Mettez la farine dans une terrine, puis le sel et, un a un, cassez les oeufs 
dans cette farine. Lorsque vous aurex remue, fait une pate a l'aide d'une cuiller, versez le lait. 
Peu a la fois tout d'abord, pusi le sucre. Et delayez le melange. Prenz alors un plat allant au four, 
et, dans ce plat, mettex environ une livre et demie de cerises. Plus elles seront noires, meilleurs 
elles seront. Les bigarreaux chantes par Victor Hugo ne sont pas de bonnes cerises de calfoutis. 
Ces cerises noires mises au fond du plat, versez dessus l'espece de cause formee par la farine 
delayee dans les oeufs et le lait; et protez le plat au four. Quand il sort du four on le saupoudre de 
sucre. Ce n'est past un plat aristocratique, mais lorsqu'il est reussi (j'en au fait parfois) it let 
delicieux. Et puis c'est le mets de l'enfance, celui du pay! Cela semble, et cela est toujours bon." <br>

<b>[1927] <br>
"Clafouti... </b><br>
Time: 1 hour, 15 minutes. Serves 6. 
400 grams (14 1/8 ounces) of cherries or of any other fruit; 125 grams (4 1/2 ounces) of flour; 2 eggs; 100 grams (3 1/2 ounces) of 
superfine sugar; a pinch of salt; 2 deciliters (6 3/4 fluid ounces, 7/8 cup) f milk that has been boiled and cooled; 20 grams 
(2/3 ounce, 1 heaping tablespoon) of butter to grease the tart pan or dish. A tart pan aboutr 24 centimeters (9 1/2 inches) in diameter and with 
sides at least 2 1/2 centimeters (1 inch) high. 
Note that the quantities of the ingredients above can be modified depending on the size of the utensil used, because unlike other 
recipes, the details do not have to [be] strictly observed. You must also increase the amount of sugar when you use acid 
cherries, and reduce it for the plums, depending on the type you use. 
Procedure: Into a small terrine or salad bowl, sift the flour, then add the salt, only half the sugar, and the eggs. Mix it with a small 
wooden spoon, to make a batter. Then add the milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, always mixing with the wooden spoon. Always add the milk 
gradually, to avoid lumps forming in the batter. Take out the pits from the fruit. If they are cherries, take the necessary 
precautikons to avoid losing the juice. Put the pitted fruits on a plate. Spread the butter in the tart pan with the tips of your 
fingers, making sure that every part of it is completely covered; if not, unmolding the clafouti will be difficult. If you use a 
baking dish, be sure to butter the sides as well as the bottom. At the bottom of the utensil, pour a few tablespoons of batter, 
spreading it out with the back of teh spoon to form a layer of batter 1/2 centimeter (3/16 inch) thick. Put it on the top shelf of the 
oven, leaving the door open, or in some other place that is warm enough so that the layer of batter will set in a few minutes. 
Then take out the utensil to rapidly arrange the fruits on the layer of dough or batter, as for a flan. Sprinkle them with the reserved 
sugar. Pour over the rest of the batter and spread it out with the back of a spoon to cover the fuits evenly. Immediately put it 
in a good strong medium oven, placing the tart pan or the bakingdish toward the bottom of the oven, as for all cakes. Allow at least 
40 minutes of cooking. If the clafouti has been cooked in a tart pan, allow it to rest for about 10 minutes before unmolding it on a 
round plate. just before serving, sprinkle the survace with fine powdered sugar--that is, glaze sugar or confectiners' sugar." <br>

<a name="coldshape">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Cold shape</b></font><br>


Cold Shape appears to be a dessert too horrible to mention. It is omitted from most cookbooks and shunned by the 
editors of the venerable <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>. This passage explains why:<p>
"In 'Domestic Manners of the English,' Margaret Farrand Thorp gives, via <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, a picture of English cookery that must daunt
the stoutest appetite. Fancy smacking one's lips over a dessert, for example, named Treacle Sponge or (horror of horrors)
Cold Shape!...if an American bill of fare can offer anything more repellent and reminiscent of the grave than Cold Shape, one cannot
remember it at the moment."<br>
---"Armchair Gossip," <i>Music Educators Journal</i>, February 1935 (p. 60)
<p>
The <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> article reference was published September 1934 (p. 371-373). It mentions, but not does not specifically 
describe, Cold Shape:<br>
"The same countenance with she approaches the sink the housewife turns toward food. Meat and vegetables are axiomatic, given, not to be
altered, merely encompassed as part of the essential duty of keeping fit...When she does dare to compose a mixture,--to construct, 
for instance a 'sweet,'--the English cook goes quite mad. The things which she combines in her panic have no conceivable real relationship.
It never occurs to her to consider how they will taste. (You cannot persuade her to taste a dish, anyhow; she boils the fish for the 
proper length of time, and if it is no done then that is its own fault.) So she produces for your delight such anomalies as
tinned apricots arranged with whipped cream to resemble poached eggs couched on pieces of cake-toast; assorted chips of fruit 
crowded into a glass and smothered with a glue-like custard; gingerbread and treacle; puddings of spaghetti and sugar flavored
with vanilla. Neither will she stoop to enlist the suggestive power of pretty names. A French cookbook instructs you to bake a 
crust till it is as golden as a sunset sky, to beat the eggs to a snow, to introduce a bouquet of savory herbs--the meanest action is bathed
in a poetic glow. The British manual talks flatly of suet and drippings, of stale bread crumbs and of grease, while British
menus bear such realistic titles as Brown Gravy Soup, Gooseberry Fool, Treacle Sponge, Cold Shape."
<p>
Historic recipes confirm similarities between cold Cornflour Pudding and Cold Shape. The connecting ingredient is cornflour,
the primary agent in <a href="foodpuddings.html#custardpowder">custard powder</a>.
This substance was generally regarded as easily digested, rendering it suitable for children, infirm, and aged diners.

<b>What is creme? (cream)</b><br>
"Creme...In the French kitchen, there is no word to match the English kitchen, there is no word to
match the English term  custard', and creme has to fill the gap. The thin pouring-sauce type of
custard is creme Anglaise. Creme patissiere is the equivalent of confectioner's custard, though the
English term trends to denote a less rich kind than the French mixture. Creme patissiere is made
from egg yolks, milk, sugar, and a little flour, with vanilla or some other flavouring; the light
version used in eclair fillings and Saint Honore also contains beaten egg whites."<br>

<b>Creme Anglaise</b><br>
"Creme" is the french word for cream, the rich dairy product that separates itself
from milk. "Anglaise" is the French adjective for "English." Food historians do
not attribute "Creme Anglaise" to a specific person, place or time. Primary
documents do not confirm a unique recipe. Creme Anglaise is historically
subtitled "English custard" in cookbooks. Not all recipes for Creme Anglaise are
titled such.
<p>
The idea behind this concoction evolved from Ancient Roman cooks who used
eggs as thickeners to create sweet custards and creams. The English have a long
history of custards and creams. So do the French. These creams have been
consumed alone and used to compose a wide range of classic desserts.

<b>Creme Anglaise recipes through time:</b><blockquote>
<b>[Escoffier:1903]<br>
4337. Creme a l'Anglaise--English Egg Custard.</b><br>
Ingredients: 500 g (1 lb 2 oz) caster sugar, 16 egg yolks, 1 litre (1 3/4 pt or 4 « U.S. cups)
boiling milk and flavouring to choice, e.g. vanilla pod or orange or lemon zest infused in
the milk or « dl (2 fl oz or 1/4 U.S. sup) of a liqueur which would be added when the
custard has cooled. Method: Place the sugar and yolks in a basin and whisk together until
they reach the ribbon stage. Add the boiling milk--with or without the infusion--a little at a
time. Place on the stove and stir with a wooden spoon until the yolks thicken the mixture
and coats the back of the spoon. Do not allow the custard to come to the boil as this will
cause it to separate. As soon as it is cooked, pass through a fine strainer or cloth and
keep in a Bain-marie if for immediate use hot, or in a basin if it is to be used cold; in this
case it should be stirred until it becomes completely cold. NOTE: When mixing the sugar
and yolks, 1 tsp of arrowroot may be added; this not only helps in obtaining a perfectly
smooth blend but prevents the custard from separating if it gets too near boiling point."

<b>Bavarian cream</b> (Bavarois)<br>
Food historians tell us Bavarian cream (aka bavarois) is a cold molded gelatin-based dessert
originating in France in the early 19th century. Careme is generally credited for the invention. The
connection with Bavaria is obscure. A survey of historic cookbooks reveals American recipes
titled "Bavarian cream" first appeared in the the 1880s.  Some of these recipes employed eggs;
others did not. Original recipes were fancy, cold, molded desserts similar to <a
href="foodicecream.html#icecreamcake">ice cream bombes</a>. Today, most Americans think
of Bavarian cream in the context of doughnut fillings.
<p>

"Bavarian cream. Bavarois. A cold dessert made from an egg custard with a gelatine, mixed with
whipped cream and sometimes fruit puree or other flavours, then set in a mould. It is not known
whether there is a connection between this dessert and Bavaria, where many French chefs used
their talents at the court of the Wittlesbach princes. Careme gives various recipes under the name
fromage bavarois (Bavarian cheese). Many cookery books confuse Bavaian cream with a similar
dish, the moscovite, which was perhaps invented by a French chef in the service of a great Russian
family."<br>

"Bavarois is a creamy cold dessert made with an egg-custard base into which are mixed cream,
beaten egg whites, a flavouring (such as chocolate or orange), and gelatine. It is then set in a
mould. The Bavarois, or bavaroise (the gender seems to be interchangeable: the masculine form
derives from French fromage bavarois, the feminine from creme bavaroise), has been popular in
Britain since the mid-nineteenth century, frequently under the anglicized name Bavarian cream.
The 1868 edition of Modern Cookery for Private families, for instance, includes directions for
making it, although it did not appear in Eliza Acton's original 1845 version. It is not known what
the original connection with Bavaria is."<br>

"The dessert called bavarois...usually consists in an egg custard...mixed with whipped cream and
set with gelatin in a mould. It first appeared in print in the early 19th century, when Careme gave
a recipe. Although the English name is sometimes  Bavarian cream' and some French authorities
believe that it was brought to France by a French chef who had been working in Bavaria, the
connection is not clearly established. However, the great chef Escoffier, when he declared the title
 Bavarois' to be illogical and suggested that  Moscovite' would be more appropriate, may be
taken to endorse by implication the topographical derivation."<br>

"Cream a la Vanille.</b><br>
Take one or two sticks of vanilla, which infuse in some boiling cream; next put in the eggs as you
do for other creams. If you are making a fromage a la glace [sometimes erroneously called
fromage bavarois] you must put a smaller quantity of eggs, as isinglass is to be put to stiffen it;
and keep constantly stirring the cream on the fire, while the eggs are doing. Mind that the eggs
are not overdone. When you perceive the cream is getting thick, put the melted isinglass in, and
rub it through a tammy, then put it into a mould, and into ice. When you wish to make the cream
more delicate, let it get cold; then put it into a vessel over ice, before you put any isinglass into it,
and whip it; when quite frozen, put it cold melted isinglass; this method requires less isinglass, and
the jelly is much lighter."<br>

those made with infusions. But in the winter season, for a grand dinner or supper, when a great
variety is required, infusions may be recurred to; but in that case, use preserved fruit and

"Bavarois.</b><br>
The chilled cream referred to under the name Bavarois in various books on cookery used to be
described as Fromage Bavarois on menus. It was subsequently shortened by elimating the word
Fromage since this was considered slightly coarse and unnecessary, but it still remains understood
though not included. The title Bavarois, although sanctioned by usage seems illogical; the title
Moscovite appears more logical and suitable. As a result of this, instead of writing Bavarois au
Cafe etc. on the menu, but could be Muscovite a la Vanille, Moscovite au Cafe etc., Bavarois are
made in two ways: 1) by using a cream mixture; 2) by using a fruit mixture....[items 4572 and
4573 are for these mixtures]...4574. The Moulding and Presentation of Bavarois. Bavarois are
usually moulded in funnel moulds which have been lightly coated inside with almond oil. When
full they should be covered with a round piece of paper and allow to set either in crushed ice or in
a refrigerator. Whe required for serving the mould is plunged quickly into lukeward water, dried,
then turned out on to the serving dish. Instead of oiling the mould a thick coating of
light-coloured caramel can be used to line it; this give an excellent appearance and taste to the
Bavarois. There is another way of presenting a Bavarois which can be recommended, this is to
mould it in a timbale or deep silver dish which is then surrounded with crushed ice. In this case the
Bavarois is not demoulded for serving thus the mixture can be made with less gelatine and
therefore it becomes more delicate. When made by this last method it is sometimes served
accompanied with a dish of stewed fruit or fresh fruit salad. However, these accompaniments are
more suitable for servivng with certain cold puddings which have much the same appearance as a
Bavarois. Finally, whether the Bavarois is made in a mould or not it can be finished by decorating
it with white or pink Creme Chantilly using a piping bag and cup or a paper cornet."<br>

<b>Chiboust</b> (Creme St. Honore)<br>
Chiboust is essentially a pastry creme mixed with egg whites (meringue). This creme takes its
name from its creator, Chiboust, who used it to accompany Gateau St. Honore. It is found under
a variety of names in cookbooks, most notably Creme St. Honore. Today, chiboust comes in
many flavors and may be found on the dessert menus of inspired chefs. While food historians and
historic texts confirm lemon creams have been popular since Medieval times, we find no print
evidence confirming Chiboust/Creme St. Honore traditionally flavored with this ingredient.
Perhaps this indicates this practice is a recent phenomenon?

<b>Creme brulee</b><p>
The name is French, but the origins are not perfectly clear. Escoffier and the other major French culinary experts do not
include recipes for this item in their classic cookbooks. Culinary experts generally agree that Creme Brulee originated in England.
They also agree recipes for this dessert vary accoring to time and place.
<p>
"One of the greatest desserts in the realm of cooking is Creme Brulee and despite its name it is not French but a very old English
one. No one seems quite to know when or how it became Gallicized, for over a long period of time it was known simply as burnt
cream. The earliest recipe I have been able to find was printed in a 17th-century cookbook from Dorsetshire. After that it had a rather
interesting history and gained considerable renown. Originally, this was a rich custard, a mixture of sugar, egg yolks and cream cooked
over heat, then poured into a dish and cooled. The top was then sprinkled with sugar and the sugar caramelized to a brown
glaze with a red-hot salamander, and old type of heavy metal tool which was lowered to the surface of the sugar and moved over
it until the intense heat melted and browned the sugar, hence the name burnt cream. Creme Brulee became a standard dessert at 
Cambridge University, especially Christ College where it was made in a special dish designed by the Copeland-Spode Co. It's amusing 
to read old cookbooks and to discover the many versions of Creme Brulee--sometimes it was made with gooseberry or raspberry fool
instead of custard...You still are more apt to find it served in England, although in America we went through a great Creme Brulee
period a number of years ago and I wish we would again, for to my mind it is without peer--few desserts are more delicious to eat
and to look at...In the years during which the recipe has been used in America, the original recipe has been considerably changed, and 
I'm not sure it was for the better. Many U.S. recipes call for a topping of brown sugared, and although I have used this from time
to time, I've never felt the result was all it should be..."<br>

[NOTE: This article contains a typical 1970s American recipe.]
<p>
"Creme brulee is a French term for a rich baked custard made with cream, rather than with milk.
The Custard is topped with a layer of sugar (usually brown) which is then caramelized by use of a
salamander or under a grill. Creme, meaning  cream, is derived from the Latin "Chrisma" through
the old French creme. The term brulee is applied to dishes such as cream custards with are finished
off with a caramelized sugar glaze. In English, the dish is Burnt cream. This term was in use as
long ago as the beginning of the 18th century, but the French term had already been used by
Massailot in 1691 and has priority, although it fell into disuse in France for a while in the 19th
century...Creme brulee is also sometimes known as Trinity cream because of its association with
Trinity College, Cambridge, where the college crest was impressed on top of the cream with a
branding iron."<br>

"Creme brulee...The <i>Random House Dictionary of the English Language</i> traces the first appearance in print of creme brulee to 1885, from 
the French, meaning 'burnt cream,' which it is often called in England. But the dish is probably not of French oridings. Escoffier
does not mention such a dish; <i>Larousse Gastronomique</i> refers to a similar dish under the name Creme Anglaise au Miroir...as 'burnt cream' the dish
originated in England, where, according to English food authority Jane Grigson recipes for the dish appeared in seventeenth-
century cookbooks. By the turn of the twentieth century it had become a favorite dessert at Trinity College, Cambridge, and, according to 
Jane Garmen in <i>Great British Cooking</i> (1981), it is often referred to as 'Trinity Cream.'Recipes for 'burnt cream' have been included
in Creole cookbooks since the nineteenth century, though the <i>Picayune Creole Cook Book</i> (1901) indicates that the confection is made
merely by adding caramel to a custard base that is then reduced, strained, garished with fruits, and served cool...The classic
American cookbook <i>Joy of Cooking</i> calls it 'A rich French custard--famous for its hard, caramelized sugar glaze.'...the
popularity of the dish in the United States soared after it was made fashionable when chef Alain Sailhac brought the idea back
from a trip to Spain (where the dish is known as an old Catalan dessert called crema quemada a la catalana) in 1982 and began 
making it at the restaurant Le Cirque in New York City. After that it became a standard dish in American fine-dining restaurants,

"Creme caramel. A sweet dish which is essentially a custard but, because it is seen as something

French, is known as a creme. The entry for that term explains that a boiled custard is often served
in France
in little individual containers. If some caramel syrup is poured into the container before the
custard is put in,
and the custard is subsequently turned out when served, it will have  a more interesting
appeareance and
flavour; and will qualify as a creme caramel. In the later part of the 20th century creme caramel
occupied
an excessively large amount of territory in European restaurant dessert menus. This was probably
due to
the convenience, for restauranteurs, of being able to prepare a lot in advance and keep them until
needed.

Puddings recollecting governmental officials (cabinets, <a href="foodpuddings.html#diplomat">diplomats</a>, chancellors) feature prominently in 19th century French/English
culinary texts. Recipes and ingredients vary through time and place. 
<p>
"Cabinet pudding. There are many variants of cabinet pudding, hot, cold, and even made with ice cream. The political link, though unexplained, is constants. Ude (1828) gives, as an
 alternative name, poudin a la chanceliere. Another name is Diplomat pudding, which may just be a translation of the French Pouding a la diplomat. Only the names differ; the puddings 
are all alike. The general method is to grease a pudding basin; stick currants or glace fruit to the grease; line it with sponge fingers or soaked macaroons; and then fill this lining with
 layers of dried fruit, sponge fingers, and custard (in cold versions including gelatin). Most versions include some spirit or liqueur as a 
flavouring. Hot ones are boiled; cold ones are made with custard or cream that needs no further cooking." <br>

<b>Cabinet Pudding </b><br>
"Cabinet pudding is redolent of a bygone age. In its most highly evolved and luxurious form, impregnated with liqueurs and decorated with crystallized fruits, it graced many a Victorian
 dinner table. The basic recipe called for sponge cakes crumbled up, to which was added a custard of eggs and milk, the whole being poached, steamed, or boiled in a mould (the ever 
economical Mrs Beeton suggested substituting bread and butter for the cake, and in fact that is the central ingredient in the first recorded recipe for cabinet pudding in Kitchener's
 Cooks Oracle, 1821). The name seems to derive from the political sort of cabinet, a supposition supported by an early synonym, chancellor's pudding, and by the practical identity of 
diplomat pudding."<br>

1256. INGREDIENTS.11/2 oz. of candied peel, 4 oz. of currants, 4 dozen sultanas, a few slices of Savoy cake, sponge cake, a French roll, 4 eggs, 1 pint of milk, grated lemon-rind, 1/4 nutmeg, 3 table-spoonfuls of sugar. 
[Illustration: CABINET PUDDING.] 
Mode.Melt some butter to a paste, and with it, well grease the mould or basin in which the pudding is to be boiled, taking care that it is buttered in every part. Cut the peel into thin slices, and place these in a fanciful device at the bottom of the mould, and fill in the spaces between with currants and sultanas; then add a few slices of sponge cake or French roll; drop a few drops of melted butter on these, and between each layer sprinkle a few currants. Proceed in this manner until the mould is nearly full; then flavour the milk with nutmeg and grated lemon-rind; add the sugar, and stir to this the eggs, which should be well beaten. Beat this mixture for a few minutes; then strain it into the mould, which should be quite full; tie a piece of buttered paper over it, and let it stand for 2 hours; then tie it down with a cloth, put it into boiling water, and let it boil slowly for 1 hour. In taking it up, let it stand for a minute or two before the cloth is removed; then quickly turn it out of the mould or basin, and serve with sweet sauce separately. The flavouring of this pudding may be varied by substituting for the lemon-rind essence of vanilla or bitter almonds; and it may be made much richer by using cream; but this is not at all necessary. Time.1 hour. Average cost, 1s. 3d. Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable at any time.

1257. INGREDIENTS.2 oz. of raisins, a few thin slices of bread and butter, 3 eggs, 1 pint of milk, sugar to taste, 1/4 nutmeg. 
Mode.Butter a pudding-basin, and line the inside with a layer of raisins that have been previously stoned; then nearly fill the basin with slices of bread and butter 
with the crust cut off, and, in another basin, beat the eggs; add to them the milk, sugar, and grated nutmeg; mix all well together, and pour the whole on to the bread
 and butter; let it stand 1/2 hour, then tie a floured cloth over it; boil for 1 hour, and serve with sweet sauce. Care must be taken that the basin is quite full before the
 cloth is tied over. Time.1 hour. Average cost, 9d. Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable at any time." <br>

<a name="flan">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Flan</b></font><br>
The history of flan, and <a href="foodpuddings.html#custard">custard</a>, a closely related recipe, begins with the
Ancient Romans. Eggs
figured prominently in many Roman recipes. The flan prepared by the Ancient Romans was quite
different from the food we eat today. Their flan was often served as a savory dish, as in "eel flan,"
although sweet flans, made with honey and pepper, were also enjoyed. When the Romans
conquered Europe, they brought their culinary traditions with them. One of these was flan. Both
sweet and savory flans (almonds, cinnamon & sugar; cheese, curd, spinach, fish) were very
popular in Europe during the Middle Ages, especially during Lent, when meat was forbidden.
According to Platina's <i>De Honesta Voluptate</i>[On Right Pleasure and Good Health], an
Italian cookery text published approximately 1475, custard-type dishes were considered health
food. In addition to being nourishing they were thought to soothe the chest, aid the kidneys and
liver, increase fertility and eliminate certain urinary tract problems. <a href="foodpuddings.html#caramel">
caramel</a> evolved in France.
<p>
"[English] Roman period...eggs took on a much greater importance in Roman times, when
domestic fowl first became common. With eggs for the first time available on such a scale, it was
now possible to consider them seriously in cookery..[the Romans] exploited eggs as a thickening
or binding agent for other foods. They borrowed from the Greeks the idea of combining eggs with
milk to form a custard mixture, which was either cooked very slowly in an earthenware pot, or
fried in oil...Another kind of egg confection was made of fruit or vegetables, or fish or shredded
meat, bound with eggs and lightly cooked in the open dish called a "patina." ...The "flathons"
(flans), "crustards" and other open tarts of medieval cookery again recall the old "patinae," with
the shallow open dish of the Romans replaced by an open pastry crust, and the filling once more
mixed and bound with eggs."<br>
---<i>Food and Drink in Britain: From the Stone Age to the 19th Century</i>, C. Anne Wilson
[Academy Chicago Publishers:Chicago] 1991 (p. 138, p.142)<br>
NOTE: This book has an excellent chapter on the histoy of eggs in English cookery (pages
137-148)
<p>
"Flan is an open tart filled with fruit, a cream, or a savoury mixture. A flan may be served as a hot
entree or as a dessert. The word comes from the Old French "flaon," from the Latin "flado,"
[meaning] a flat cake. Flans have been in existence for centuries. They are mentioned in the works
of the Latin poet Fortunatus (530-609AD), and featured in medieval cookery--Taillevent gave
numerous recipes for flans. The word flan in France and Spain is also used for an egg
custard, often carmel-flavoured, that is made in a mould and then turned out and served
cold."<br>
---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, edited by Jenifer Harvey Lang [Crown:New York] 1989
(page 445):<br>
<p>
"Flan is a term with two meanings. The one most familiar in Britain...is  An open pastry or sponge
case containing a (sweet or savoury) filling. A typical flan of this sort is round, with shortcrust
pastry. It is either baked blind before the hot or cold filling is added, or baked with the filling. The
filling, especially if it is a sweet one, may incorporate custard. In France, the term "flan"
carries the first meaning as described above, but often has the second meaning: a sweet custard
which is baked in a mould in the oven until set, when it may be served in the mould or turned out.
The second meaning is the one which is used in Spain and Portugal, where flan is a
standard dessert, and in many countries, e.g. Mexico, where either language is used. The second
and very widespread meaning is the one which corresponds to the etymology of the term. The Old
French "flaon" derived from the Latin "flado" had as its principal meaning  a
"custard." From the same Latin root came the Middle English word "flaton" and
"flawn" from which much later came flan."<br>
---<i>The Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford]
1999 (p. 305)
<p>
<b>About flan in Spain</b><br>
"Both Spain and Portugal also have a Moorish inheritance of very sweet egg-rich desserts, some
ingeniously using up the egg whites left over from a pudding using only egg yolks--Pudim
Molotoff (Molotoff Pudding), for example. Flan, caramel custard, the Creme Renversee au
Caramel of the French, is universally popular. It may be flavoured with orange, if liked, but it is
the traditional caramel custard that enjoys such popularity and is an equal favorite throughout
Latin America...Quite literally everyone loves flan."<br>
---<i>The Food of Spain and Portugal: The Complete Iberian Cuisine</i>, Elisabeth Lambert
Ortiz [Atheneum:New York] 1989 (p. 264)
<p>
"...the Spanish sweet tooth is gratified by a range of dessert wines and liqueurs and
special-occasion candies, some of almost Oriental sugariness. Almonds and honey are included in
many of them Turron, or nougat, white or dark, soft or brittle, is exceedingly more-ish and is now
a big
industry in Jijona. The Arabic influences in candy-making are pronounced and candies such as
amarguillos date from Moorish times...In the Spanish kitchen, milk and cream are commandeered
for desserts, particularly in the north...The national dessert...is caramel custard, called flan."<br>
---<i>Recipes from a Spanish Village</i>, Pepita Aris [Simon & Schuster:New York] 1990 (p.
124)
<p>
"...in looking for the roots of Spanish food traditions one must go back to the Phoenicians, who
founded the city now called Cadiz in 1100BC; the ancient Greeks, and the Carthaginians...and
more important, the Romans who used Spain as a major source of food, especially wheat and
olive oil...Introductions by the Arabs were also of fundamental importance for Spain's future.
They are particularly associated with the use of almonds (the essential ingredient for so many
Spanish desserts, baked goods, and confectionery items); with the introduction of citrus fruits
(including the lemon and the bitter (Seville) orange, without which British marmalade would
never have been born); sugar cane and the process of refining sugar from its juice..."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Hasty pudding</b></font><br>

Food historians trace the genesis of hasty pudding to medieval grain pottages. These simple, filling, and quickly prepared dishes filled the bellies of rich and poor 
alike. The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> traces the first print evidence of this term to 1599. Recipes vary considerably, according to period and place. British Isle 
recipes generally employ oatmeal. Regional variations are noted. Early American versions were made, quite predictably, 
with maize. Think: <a href="foodfaq.html#cornmealmush">cornmeal mush</a>.
<p>
"As its name suggests, hasty pudding is a pudding that can be assembled at very short notice. Its exact ingredients vary from place to place, but in essence it is a 
sort of porridge made from crushed or ground cereal grains and milk. In Britain, where the term originated in the late sixteenth century, it traditionally refers to a 
sweet milk pudding made with flour, semolina, or tapioca. In the USA it is made with the main indigenous cereal, maize, which is often sweetened with maple
 syrup or brown sugar."<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 158)
<p>
"Hasty pudding, the simplest of all puddings, if it can be called a pudding at all, for it is no more than a porridge of  flour and milk. Such a pudding should be
 made in little more time than it took to boil the milk, and it has no doubt been a popular emergency dish since the Middle Ages, if not earlier. Sweetened,
 flavoured with spice or rosewater, and dotted with butter, hasty pudding can be quite palatable; and in fact in the 18th and 19th centuries in England it was 
esteemed as a delicacy. Before 1800, an egg was often added to the mixture, though after this time mixtures with egg were given othes names...In the far north 
of England, and in Scotland, at least as early as the 18th century, the name came to be applied to a plain porridge of oats and barley, made with water as often as 
milk. In Victorian England...Hasty pudding was sometimes made with oatmeal, or with sago or with tapioca. Milk was always used."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson, 2nd edition, Tom Jaine editor [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2006 (p. 373)
<p>
"Oatmeal went into milk porridige and water gruel. The later at its simplest contained no more than oatmeal and water, but it was often flavoured with shredded
 onions or leeks, and enriched with butter or dripping...Later in that [18th century] 'hasty pudding', 'crowdie' and 'boiled milk', all oatmeal pottages, became more
 and more confined to northern and western Britian. In the north hasty pudding was a constant part of the diet. Thirteen ounces of oatmeal and a quart of water, 
boiled together with salt, was said to be 'sufficent for a meal for two labourers. It is eaten with a little milk or beer poured upon it, or with a little cold butter put into
 the midde, or with a little treacle.' Crowdie was made by pouring boiling water on to oatmeal and stirring it: a piece of fat taken from meat broth was put to it as 
seasoning. It was  'a very common dish in the north among labourers of all descriptions, particularly miners'. <br>
---<i>Food and Drink in Britain: From the Stone Age to the 19th Century</i>, C. Anne Wilson [Academy Chicago:Chicago] 1981 (p. 213)
<p>
"A wide range of successors to the cereal pottages of medieval times still existed in the form of sweetened cereal preparations such as frumenty, gruel, pap, and 
milk pottage of crumbled bread, barley, rice or sago. In their ingredients these closely resembled puddings (except for the absense of suet), but they were of a 
runnier consistency, and were cooked directly over the fire. Until the later seventeenth century milk pottages were eaten on fasting days...The only named pudding
 to be made by the pottage method was the 'pudding in haste' or 'hasty pudding' of southern and midland Britain. It was in effect a thicker form of bread and milk
 pottage. It was prepared by boiling milk or cream, adding breadcrumbs and some flour, with such enrichments as butter, eggs, raisins, currants, spices and sugar. 
The mixture was then brought again to the boil. It had to be stirred constantly as it cooked, but was soon ready: hence its name. The hasty pudding of northern 
England, Scotland and Wales, was however, quite a different matter, for it was simply the traditional oatmeal pottage and only in name resembled the newfangled
 puddings of southern Britain."<br>
---<i>ibid </i>(p. 320)
<p>
"One of the earliest American desserts was a quickly thrown-together mixture of cornmeal, milk, and molasses called "cornmeal mush" or "hasty puddding,"
 known at least since 1691. (Harvard's literary society has been called the "Hasty Pudding Club" since 1795.)"<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 258)
<p>
"Acquiring its name from the speed with which it supposedly could be prepared, hasty pudding was also called stirabout pudding. In Britain, hasty pudding had 
been made from such things as grated bread and oatmeal, although as time went on, the oatmeal version tended to be confined to the north and west. Recipes 
utilizing a wheat flour base were common in eighteenth-century cookbooks. In New England, of course, cornmeal rapidly became the key ingredient. Simple as it 
was, hasty pudding still admitted a degree of variation in methods of preparation. In the earliest Yankee cookbook recipe, in Child's <i>American Frugal Housewife</i>
, spoonfuls of sifted cornmeal were dissolved in a bowl of water, and then the solution was poured into boiling water, the amount varying "according to the size of 
your family." Salt and handfuls of additional meal were thrown into the kettle, while the mixtutr was being constantly stirred. "When it is so thick that you stir it with 
great difficulty, it is about right." According to Child, that would have been after half an hour, which was perhaps just in time to prevent the name from becoming
 a misnomer. The dish was to be eaten with milk or molasses. Rye meal was preferable to corn "if the system is in a restricted state." Regarding the requisite cooking
 time, Catharine Beecher had quite a different idea, abandoning all pretense of connection between name and thing, by stating that two or three hours was 
needed...hasty pudding as fried mush remained prominent in most subsequent recipes...Possibly the plainest preparation in a culinary repertoire that was nothing 
if not plain, hasty pudding nevertheless provided the inspiration for one of the eariest instances of the use of Yankee food for cultural mythmaking about New 
England. We refer to "The Hasty Pudding," a poem written by the Revolutionary-era "Connecticut wit" Joel Barlow while he was living in France in 1793...The 
poem actually provided the first New England recipe for hasty pudding, depicting a housewife who "strews" the cornmeal into a kettle of boiling water until
 it "thickens all the flood."...In Barlow's view, the knowledge required for eating hasty pudding in the proper fashion was more complex and hard-won than that for
 cooking it...Those familiar with the Italian dish polenta...may not realize that it essentially hasty pudding under the name given to it by "the soft nations round the
 warm Levant."<br>

<p>
<b>Here is Mrs. Child's recipe, circa 1833:</b><br><blockquote>
<b>"Hasty Pudding. </b><br>
Boil. water, a quart , three pints, or two quarts, according to the size of your family; sift your meal, stir five or six spoonfuls of it thorougly into a bowl of water; 
when the water in the kettle boils, pour into it the contents of the bowl; stir it well, and let it boil up thick; put in salt to suit your own taste, then stand over the
 kettle, and sprinkle in meal, handful after handful, stirring it very thoroughly all the time and letting it boil between whiles. When it is so thick that you stir it with
 great difficulty, it is about right. It takes about half an hour's cooking. Eat it with milk or molasses. Either Indian meal or rye meal may be used. If the system is in 
a restricted state, nothing can be better than rye hasty pudding and West India molasses. This diet would save many a one the horrors of dyspepsia."<br>

One of the recently recovered episodes of Dr. Who references Kaiser Pudding. Which Kaiser was this dish named for & what was the original recipe?
Excellent questions with fuzzy answers. Our survey of UK cook books, culinary history texts and print media returned only one recipe titled
Kaiser Pudding. It was published by Mrs. Beeton in 1909. 
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/wilhelm_kaiser_ii.shtml">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a> was ruling in Germany 1909, but that does 
not automatically mean this dish was named for him. Curiously? In our copy of this book this recipe is crossed out in pencil. We do not 
know who did this or when. No other recipes are crossed out, including the ones with "German" in the title.
<br><blockquote>

<b>[1909]<br>
"Kaiser Pudding. </b><br> 
Ingredients.--2 ozs. of ground almonds, sugar to taste, 3 eggs, 1/2 pint of cream, 1 dessertspoonful of orange-juice, blanched almonds, shredded candied peel.<br> 
Method.--Separate and beat the yolks of the eggs, add 1 tablespoonful of castor sugar, the ground almonds and the cream gradually. Whisk the whites stiffly, stir them lightly in, and add more sugar if necessary. Have ready a mould well buttered and lightly covered with shredded almonds and candied peel, then pour in the mixture.

"Pease porridge hot. Pease porridge cold. Pease porridge in the pot nine days old." What was Mother Goose feeding her children? 
Pease porridge descends from pease pottage, an ancient dish of boiled legumes. Economical, ubiquitous, filling, nutritious. And for
some? The only food available for days on end. <a href="vegetables.html#peas">Peas</a> have been consumed from prehistory to present.

<b>What is pottage/porridge?</b><br>
"Pottage. The medieval term for a semi-liquid cooked dish, typically based on cereal, which in
various forms
was a mainstay of diet for many centuries. The world comes from the French potage meaning
something
cooked in a pot. It thus was a very wide application. It is no longer in use in English, its function
having been
taken over by porridge, which is the same word, slightly changed and now having a more
restricted
meaning. Pottages were a universal feature of primitive kinds of cookery, but they developed at
an early
stage into quite sophisticated preparations. In Roman times, Apicius gave a recipe for a pottage
(tisana was
the name he used) made of barley with three kinds of pulses, eight kinds of leafy vegetables, four
flavouring
herbs, liquamen (fish sauce), and a garnish of chopped cabbage leaves. In the Middle Ages, and
especially
in Britain, pottages were eaten by all, from the poorest to the richest. The simplest kinds were
cereal
pottages: oatmeal in the north, barley, rye or wheat frumenty in the south. To the rich these dishes
were an
accompaniement to meat; to the poor they were complete meals. Pease pottage, made from dried
peas,
and other pulses pottages were equally important. These dishes might be quite plain or contain
herbs or
other additions...Indeed, because the term pottage had such a wide meaning it could embrace
many
subcategories of  dishes."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] (p.
629-30)<br>
<p>
"Porridge. Originally porridge was the same word as pottage 'boiled dish of vegetables, cereals,
meat, etc..' Not until the early sixteenth century did the two begin to go their separate ways
phonetically...and they remained semantically linked for some time after that--Dr. Johnson, for
example, in his <i>Dictionary</i> (1755) defined porridge as 'food made by boiling meat in water;
broth'. A particular sort of pottage was that made with cereals, which in Scotland sould generally
by oats, and it was this that eventually inherited the name porridge, but as late as the end of the
eighteenth century pottage was still being used for this, too."<br>

<p>
<b>Peas pudding</b><br>
"Pease pudding (alternatively known as pease porridge) is a peculiarly British dish, on account of
the long-standing perference in Britain for pease over other pulses. It began its career in remote
antiquity as pease pottage, a thick porridge made from the dried mealy pease that were a staple
food; this was the most usual way of preparing them. Pease pottage and, when available, bacon
went together in the diet of simple country people. The bacon was heavily salted and the pease
pottage, made without salt, balanced the flavour. At the beginning of the 17th century the
introduction of the pudding cloth allowed pease pudding, a more solid product, to be made.
Usually the ingredients consisted only of pease (previouly soaked, if dried pease are used), and a
little flavouring: sugar and pepper, and sometimes mint, were commonly used. The ingredients
were mixed and simply cooked in a pudding  cloth in simmering liquid, perhaps alongside a piece
of bacon, and for which the pudding would be a fine accompaniement. ..Pease pudding has now
lost its importance in the British diet, but remains popular in the north...
     It has been suggested that the old nursery rhyme: Pease pudding hot...referenced not to the
inevitable appearance of the dish at all meals but to the making of a fermented product like a
semi-solid version of Indonesian tempe, or a primitive form of Japanses miso. Certainly, if the
procedure in the rhyme were followed, boiling, cooling, and leaving for nine days, 
micro-organisms naturally present would have caused some kind of fermentation to take place,
but
unless some kind of starter had been used, the most likely result would have been spoilage."<br> ---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
591)<br>
[NOTE: related foods are peasemeal (ground pease) and Scottish brose (pease meal mixed with
oatmeal)]
<p>
"Young green pease were cooked in good beef broth flavoured with parsley, sage, savory and
hyssop; while old dried pease were poiled in bacon stock and eaten afterwards with the bacon
meat...The labourer's family often had to make do this a miniscule lump of bacon, or perhaps none
at all, in which case the pottage was thickened with oatmeal, flour or breadcrumbs to give it more
substance. This thick pease pottage remained a basic country dish for several hundred years. For
Lenten pottages, white pease were recommended. They were usually flavoured with minced
onions and sugar or honey and often coloured with saffron. (p. 203)
     ...the traditional, pease porridge was a national dish of Tudor and Stuar England, referred to in
French recipe books as 'pottage in the English style'. It was eaten at most levels of society, but
more particularly amoung labourers' families, when it was often made very thick with flour or
breadcrumbs and was called pease porridge. With the advent of the pudding boiled in a cloth,
pease were given similar treatment, being packed into a pudding-cloth or bag, simmered in water
or broth, and turned out as a solid mass that was sliced and eaten with bacon or pickled pork. But
in the course of the eighteenth century pease pottage lost much of its importance. Per Kalm
reported that people of the middling sort, although they ate green pease avidly in the summer
season, had little use for dried pease or beans. Later pease soup, like all other soups, ceased to be
labourers' fare in the south; and even in the pottage-eating north of England it was not very
popular. It remained an occasional item of diet in most parts of the country, but it could no
longer claim to be one of England's national dishes.. (p. 216-7)<br>

<a name="frumenty">
<b>Frumenty</b><br>
This wheat-based pottage graces French and English cooking texts from Medieval times to the late 19th century. Generally
served as a sweet course, this creamy porridge was consumed by people of all social classes. Early spelling variations make researching
this dish a special treat. Think: frumenty, fermenty, fourmentee, &c. 
<p>
"Frumenty, a  'porridge' made from wheat. The name is derived from the classical Latin
frumentum meaning corn (in the general sense of the word). In the Middle Ages it seems to have
been a staple food but as time progressed the dish appeared only on special occasions and with
slight regional differences. In the preparation of frumenty, new wheat is shelled, cooked slowly
in milk, and flavoured and sweetened. This glutinous mass, which is known as creed...wheat,
used to be available ready dressed. Modern recipes which include butter, cream, sugar, rum, or
brandy to produce something like a liquid Christmas pudding have little in common with the
traditional forms of frumenty. Frumenty appears to have been used formerly as an
accompaniment to animal food, as  'venison with frumenty' formed part of the second course
served at the royal banquet given to Henry IV at Winchester on his marriage to Joan of Navarre.
At the present day it is usually boiled with new milk and sugar, to which spices, currants, yolks
of eggs, etc. are sometimes added, and is occasionally eaten as a dinner sweet at various times of
the year--at mid-Lent, Easter, and Christmas. In the north of England, however, it is always
exclusively a part of the Christmas fare, and is eaten hot. There is evidence that in the past,
frumenty was eaten at secular feasts, in celebration of harvest home, for instance. Before the
1860s it seems unlikely that frumenty was an everyday food for the rural time. In the Victorian
age, however, records show that it was common workhouse fare. There are many regional
variations. In Somerset, it is known as furmenty or furminty."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 323)
<p>
"In Britain pottage remained in favor at every level of society. Bread, pottage and ale were the three great staples of diet...
The materials of pottage were...many and varied. The only object was to product a semi-liquid spoonmeat, often of very 
thick consistency...Early recipes for frumenty describe the process. 'Take clean wheat, and beat it small in mortar, and fan out clean the
dust; then wash it clean, ane boil it till it be tender and brown.' In other recipes wehat was boiled in water till the grains burst, 
the cooled and mixed with cow's milk or milk of almonds; and well beaten egg yolks were often stirred in too. If the eggs did not colour it 
enouth, it was yellowed with saffron. At the meals of great families wheaten frumenty was the accompaniment of venison or
porpouise. But the frumenty of poorer folk was a breakfast or supper dish in itself, and it was usually made of maslin or
barley, mixed with milk when that was to be had, or with water alone, or with a little cream or butter."<br>

preparation. Take as much wheat as may be required, wash it well, then put it in a jar, and cover with cold water; leave it to soak for 
twelve hours, then bake it in a very slow oven until done. It should crack and be soft, but not be broken up; it may take form four to six
hours. Some prefer to bake the wheat in milk, which makes it nicer and more nourishing, but it does not cook well; another way, and a good one, 
 is to use water for the first part of the cooking, and milk for the finish. When ready for the frumenty , take some of teh baked wheat, and allow for ech quart the same 
measure of new milk; put both over the fire and stir to the boil; add about a quarter of a pound of clean dry curants, or raisins, stoned and halved, adn in about twenty minutes take
 the pan from the fire, and stir in sugar to taste and some spice (nutmeg or cinnamon is often used); then beat in a couple of eggs, or, where thery are plentiful, more
may be used; do not boil again, but beat for some few minutes. This should be sent to table in a junket bowl, and served in cups. To
rich dishes of this sort, in the days when frumenty was a Lord Mayor's dish, brandy was one of the ingredients. When whole wheat cannot
be got, cracked wheat may be used. We may mention that other fruits are as nice as those named. For example, prunes, figs, dates, and dried 
bananas are very suitable; currants are not digestible, and are better omitted if for children; the raisins are improved 
by soaking for a few hours in water."<br>

The history behind pudding mix is fascinating stuff. In the middle of the 19th century
[corresponding
neatly with the dawn of the modern industrial age] technological advances enabled the refinement
of cornstarch extraction. Alfred Bird's <a href="foodpuddings.html#custardpowder">custard powder</a> [1847] made
from flavored cornstarch set the stage. By the turn of the
20th century recipes for all sorts of corn-starch puddings [most noticeably chocolate and tapioca]
were featured in mainstream cookbooks, both under the categories of dessert and convalescent
foods. <br>
<blockquote>
"Chocolate corn starch pudding<br>
Melt one-third square unsweetened chocolate and add to Corn Starch Pudding [the recipe for this
is given on the same page, it is not a mix] before adding egg."<br>

Fueled by the men's nutrition [Battle Creek, MI--Mr. Kellogg & Mr. Post] and women's domestic
science [Boston, MA--Miss Farmer & Miss Parloa] movements, the invention of packaged
pudding mix was inevitable. One might suppose that when General Foods [aka Jell-O]  introduced
its chocolate pudding mix in 1926 it was simply cashing in on the fact that people loved
[chocolate] pudding and believed that "store bought it better." That reasoning might also account
for General Foods' timely acquisition of the Minute Tapioca Company.
<p>
Jell-O wasn't the only brand of  gelatin desserts & puddings manufactured in the US in the late
19th/early 20th century. Other popular brands were Knox and Royal. All three brands published
recipe booklets to promote their products. It is interesting to note that booklets published in the
1900s-1910s contain recipes for custard made with gelatin.
<p>
This passage from <i>Royal Desserts</i>, Standard Brands [1932] confirms two things: pudding
mixes had recently been introduced to the American public and Americans regarded pudding as a
healthy food. 
<p><blockquote>
"These new Royal Puddings suit every taste
two new popular flavors
both made with healthful Arrowroot Starch.
     You'll be enthusastic about the delicious, real "homemade" taste of these puddings. Royal
Chocolate Pudding has that rich, creamy chocolate flavor everybody loves. Royal Vanilla Pudding
is flavored with real vanilla extract--and not imitation vanilla flavoring...and what a difference that
makes in both taste and aroma!
<p>
Royal puddings look good too. They have none of that cheap, watery, thin appearance. They hold
their shape perfectly without being pasty and "starchy."
     Arrowroot makes them different!
Royal Puddings are made with arrowroot starch for thickening. That's what makes them taste
different...look different. That's why, too, they're ideal for children's desserts. For arrowroot
starch has long been recognized as unusually nutritious and easily digested.
     The finest cooks prefer arrowroot as a thickener because it is easy to keep smooth and because
it cooks quickly, yet is entirely free from any "starch" taste, making desserts of unusual tenderness
and delicacy. And Royal Chocolate and Vanilla Puddings are made up with milk...another
important reason why they make such particularly wholesome desserts for children. Food experts,
dietitians and doctors, you know, emphasize the necessity of milk in the diet. [we can confirm
this, we have a US Dept. of Agriculture brochure from this time period touting the healthfulness
of milk]
     Prepared in 6 minutes!
<p>
Royal Puddings are wonderfully easy to make. Think of it--they can be perpared and cooked in
only 6 minutes! Yet the arrowroot cooks completely in this time. There's no fuss, no bother, no
extra dishes, when making Royal Puddings. All you have to do is add cold milk to the pudding in
a sauce pan and stir while bringing to a boil. If preferred, it may also be cooked in a double boiler
until completely thickened. This method is recommended for large quantities of Royal Pudding."

"Puddings that may be prepared in thirty seconds, frostings ready for spreading, popcorn of every hue in the rainbow, chocolates

amazed even our own tasters, whose palates--after sampling the variety of foods considered for this colunm in the course of a

a roaty beater thirty seconds--and dessert is served. It is a creamy pudding, smooth in texture, delicate if flavor, a puding
that can double as a pie or cake filling. The American Maize-Products Company, the manufaturer, has furnished the market with
another cornstarch pudding, but this one, contrary to its predecessors, needs no cooking. The label does not exaggerate; the pudding
may be made ready in half a minute. Three flavors are offered: vanilla, chocoalte and--rather less to our liking--butterscotch.
Cream, plain or whipped, will suggest itself as a garnish. Sliced fruit is another possibility for the vanilla dessert. Gimbels

"Blancmange has not always been the pale wobbling thing which until recently lurked 
behind jellies on Britain's tea tables. When the word first entered the English language, in 
the fourteenth century, it was used for a savoury dish. As its name inmplies (French 
blanc, white', manger, eat'--the final 'r' did not dissapear until the nineteenth century) it 
was made from pale ingredients. Almonds, in some form or another--ground, fried, or as 
almond milk--were included, as was rice, either whole or as rice flour; these formed the 
basis of a thick gruel or pottage, to which was added chicken meat...The transformation 
of the chicken dish of the Middle Ages to the modern confection was a gradual one. Often 
the chicken was omitted, and a gelling agent added. By the eighteenth century it had 
become a sort of almond jelly, made with milk or cream. In the nineteenth century 
arrowroot was introduced into the recipe as a thickener, with flavourings such as lemon 
peel and cinnamon making it an appropriate dessert dish. This paved the way for the 
modern commercial cornflour-based version, which...remained a mainstay among British 
puddings until the 1960s, when instant pre-prepared desserts started its demise." <br>

"Blancmange...The ancestor of the homely modern [pudding-like] dish was honoured on 
medieval and Renaissance menus all over W. Eruope. The 14th- and 15th-century English 
blancmangers were made of shredded chicken breast, sugar, rice, and wither ground 
almonds or almond milk, but there were many variations on the idea on the Continent; 
furthermore, there was a whole family of related dishes...It has long been speculated that 
it derives from the Middle East, whence both rice and almondsd were imported. One of 
the most widespread dishes in medieval Arab cuisine is isfdhabaj (a Persian name which 
also means white food'), and the recipes translated by Arberry (1939) is lamb stewed 
with almond milk. However, Perry (1989) points out that this happens to be the only 
isfidhabaj recipe in Arab culinary literature containing almond milk; the others show little 
or no resesmblance to the European dish. It seems likely that blancmanger does reflect 
eastern influence, but the exact source and path are obscure...Although modern people are 
always surprised to learn of a sweet made from chicken breast, this was common in 
medieval Arab cuisine, where chicken was sometimes literally candied. The concept 
survives in the contemporary Turkish rice and chicken dessert Tavuk gogsu kazandibi, 
whether this is an idea picked up from the Arab sources or conceivably a version of 
blancmanger." <br>

"While the ordinary people of [Medieval] lowland Britain ate their pease pottage...the 
nobility and gentry enjoyed some of the rich spicy meat and fish pottages introduced from 
Norman France. The great Anglo-Norman pottages--'civey', gravey', charlet', 
buckkenade', mortrews', blancmange' and others--took their character not from the 
meat of fish they contained, but from the sauce in which those ingredents were 
cooked...'Blancmange' was another standing pottage, chiefly notable for the absence of 
strong spices in its composition. The ingredients were capon [chicken] flesh, teased small 
with a pin, whole boiled rice, alsmond milk and plenty of sugar. It was decorated with a 
surface scattering of red and white aniseed comfits or blanced almonds. At a feast, 
blancmange was sometimes departed' or divided into two parts, one of which was 
coloured red or yellow as a contrast to the other which was left white; or it was departed 
with a different pottage, such as the yellow caudel ferry'. Needlesss to say mortrews of 
fish' and blancmange of fish' were eaten on fasting days...perch or lobster or dried 
haddock for the fish day blancmange." <bR>

"Prominent among the festal foods of medieval times had been the pottages made from 
meat with sweet dried fruits, almonds, sugar and spices. Of the thick ones blancmange 
was the principal survivor; and like its predecessor, based usually upon teased or carded 
capon meat, and ground almonds were still a frequent flavouring, thought htey were often 
supplemented and sometimessupplanted by rosewater. And when it is thick as pap', said 
a contemporary recipe, take it form the fire, and put it in a fair platter, and when it is 
cold, lay three slices on a dish, and cast a little sugar on it, and so serve it in.' But an 
alternative version now existed as well, a meatless blancmange made with cream, sugar 
and rosewater, thickened with egg yolks or with beaten egg whites. Blancmange, which 
had been a first course dish in medieval times, now tended to appear in the second course, 
sometimes offered along with leach. During the seventeenth century both capon flesh and 
meatless types coexisted, the latter now sometimes thickened with wheat or flour; and 
Robert May still offered recipes for fish blancmange too. Then, late in the century, a new 
concept of the dish arrived from France. It began with a hen, but this hen was boiled with 
calves' feet, and the resultant jelly was thickened with ground almonds, flavoured with 
rosewater and allowed to set. In another recipe the hen was omitted altogether, and the 
hartshorn jelly made, which was strained with ground almonds and milk. Such 
blancmange closely resembled white leach. It also foreshadowed the Englsih blancmange 
of the eighteenth century, which was always a kind of jelly, stiffened with isinglass or 
hartshorn, coloured with milk, cream or beaten egg whites, but still flavoured with the 
almonds which had so long been associated with the confection of that name. The final 
transformation came from the new world. In the West Indies, as in the East Indies, 
arrowroot was cultivated as a source of starch. Perhaps the early settlers recognized its 
potential as a thickener for meatless blancmange. By the early 1820s recipes were 
published there for American or West Indian blancmange. Boiling milk, sweetened and 
seasoned with a little cinnamon and lemon peel, was poured upon a solution of arrowroot 
and stirred briskly the while, since it thickened instantly. It was put into a mould and 
turned out the next day. Here at last was the true precursor or the modern cornflour 
blancmange." <br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Bread pudding</b></font><br>
The history of bread dates back to prehistoric times; pudding (both sweet and savory) was first
enjoyed by ancient peoples. Food historians generally attribute the origin of basic bread pudding
to
frugal cooks who did not want to waste stale bread. Since very early times it was common
practice to use stale/hard bread in many different ways...including edible serving containers
(Medieval sops, foccacia), stuffings (forcemeat), special dishes (French toast) and thickeners
(puddings).  In the 19th century recipes for bread pudding were often included in cookbooks
under the heading "Invalid cookery." Recipes vary greatly and are often influenced by the type of
bread employed.
<p>
"Bread puddings. An importrant category. Many desserts include bread whether in the form of
breadcrumbs or slices of bread...It is safe to assume that from the very distant past cooks have
sometimes turned stale bread intoa sweet pudding, if only by soaking it in milk, sweetening it by
one means or another, and baking the result. The addition of some fat, preferably in the form of butter, and something like currantsis all that is needed to move this frugal dish into the category of
treats, and this is what has ensured its survival in the repertoire, even on cooks who never have
stale bread on their hands. This enhanced product is known as bread and butter pudding and this
same dish can also be made with something more exotic than plain bread, for example, brioche,
pannetone, slices of plain cake, etc. and can be enlivened by judicious spicing or by reinforcing the
currants with plumper sultanas and mixed peel. But such elaborations must be kept under strict
control, so that what is essentially a simple pudding does not lose its character under the weight
of sophisticated additions. The likely history of the pudding can be illuminated by looking back at
medieval  sops and at the medieval practice of using a hollowed-out loaf as the container for a
sweet dish...variants of bread pudding could be eaten hot as pudding or cold as a cake...an
Egyptian dessert which bears a marked similarity to bread and butter pudding, and which was
originally a simple dish or rural areas...is called Om Ali  and is made with bread...milk or cream,
raisins, and almonds...Another Middle Eastern bread sweet, Eish es serny (palace bread), is mad
by drying large round slices cut horizontally through a big loaf to make enormous rusks, which
are then simmered in sugar and honey syrup flavoured with rosewater and coloured with caramel.
Traveling further east, an Indian dessert in the Moghul style, Shahi tukra, is made with bread fried
in ghee, dipped in a syrup flavoured with saffron and rosewater, and covered with a creamy sauce
in which decorative slices of almond are embedded.""<br>

<b>Bread pudding & the Civil War</b><br>
Our survey of Civil War food history books and primary sources indicates bread pudding was popular on both sides of the Mason Dixon Line. Civil war soldiers
 sometimes subsitituted crackers for bread. Sweeteners were hard to come by, especially for Confederate soldiers. Still? They made do. Notes here: 
<p>
"Desserts existed almost solely in the imagination, especially with the scarcity of sugar. "If we wanted something extra, we pounded our crackers into fine pieces, 
mixed it up with sugar, raisons and water, and boiled it in our tin cups,"..."This we called pudding." Some Yankees bought meal at a local meal and made flapjacks 
and puddings in what Fisk said was "a style of simplicity such as only soldiers would think of adopting." For Confederates, a final "course" could be even less 
appetizing. Fruit and berries were ocften baked into pies that for want of sugar and proper flour, could be fearsome to the taste and digestion. Some Kentucky
 Confederates made a sugarless fried pie, "this having all the tough elasticity of a rubber suspender." Once in a while, when there was a little sugar, soldiers with Lee 
made blackberry pies. Often the only sweetener available was watermelon juice, not easy to obtain when by 1863 a single watermelon sold for $40.00 in the 
camps." <br>

Rice pudding is an ancient dish enjoyed by people of many cultures and cuisines. This food traces
its roots to the grain pottages of made by middle eastern cooks. It has long been associated with
good nutrition and easy digestion, and were first mentioned in medical texts rather than cookery
books.  Throughout history rice pudding has been recommended for the young, the old, and
people of all ages with stomache ailments. In 19th century America, arrowroot and <a

The <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/books/kiple/rice.htm">history of rice</a> is a long and complicated story. Food historians generally agree that rice
came to Europe by way of India. At first, rice was not used as an ingredient in cooking. It was
prized for its medicinal value and known as a thickening agent. The history of <a

cardamom, cinnamon, almond, pistachio, saffron, kewra essence...or rosewater, etc. For special
occasions it is customary to decorate the chilled kheer with edible silver or gold leaf. The Persian

"Kheer. A sweet confection based on rice. When prepared as a ritual  pucca' food, the rice is first
lightly fried in ghee before boiling with sugared milk till the milk thickens. A kheer of jowar is
mentioned in the fourteenth century padmavat of Gugarat, and other cereal products (vermicelli,
cev, pheni) may be used as well. A thinner product is payasam, and both are popular desserts,
routinely as well as on festive occasions. The Hindi word kheer derives from the Sanskrit ksheer

fruit preserved with honey. Eight was said by Confucius to be the number of perfection. The fruits

pudding is then steamed for several hours so that the rice breaks down into a homogenous

<b>Europe</b><br>
"Rice pudding is the descendant of earlier rice pottages, which date back to the time of the
Romans, who however used such a dish only as a medicine to settle upset stomaches. There were
medieval rice pottages made of rice boiled until soft, then mixed with almond milk or cow's milk,
or both, sweetened, and sometimes coloured. Rice was an expensive import, and these were
luxury Lenten dishes for the rich. Recipes for baked rice puddings began to appear in the early
17th century. Often they were rather complicated...Nutmeg survives in modern recipes. It is now
unusual to add eggs or fat, and rice pudding has tended to become a severely plain nursery dish.
Nevertheless, it has its devotees."<br>

pound of sugar. It is necessary that it boil a half hour far from flame, on coals, because of smoke,
and be stirred with a spoon. Rice can be cooked the same way in goat's milk. Because this dish
quickly absorbs smoke, if that should happen, get rid of the smoke this way: transfer the rice from

Rice pudding was a popular dish during Shakespeare's time. The Bard himself alludes to it's
making at a celebratory feast in <i>A Winter's Tale</i>, Act IV, Scene iii, lines 37-49.
The book <i>Dining With William Shakespeare</i> by Madge Lorwin reprints an original recipe
from Thomas Dawson's <i>The Good Huswifes Jewell</i> (1596): "To Make a Tart of
Ryse...boyle your rice, and put in the yolkes of two or three Egges into the Rice, and when it is
boyled put it into a dish and season it with sugar, synamon and ginger, and butter, and the juice of

are many forms of processed tapioca: flakes, seeds & pearls. Tapioca has traditionally been
considered a healthy food because this form of starch is easy to digest. In 19th century America,
tapioca pudding was often prescribed for the young, old and infirm. Arrowroot was a similar
product. <a href="foodpuddings.html#minutetapioca">Minute Tapioca</a>, a quick cooking version, dates to 1894.

<b>What is tapicoa?</b><br>
An important product of Cassava, and broadly speaking the only one which has a presence in
western kitchens. Cassava flour is treated in such a way as to form what are called flakes, seeds,
and pearls of tapioca, which consitute an article of commerce known under the name  tapioca
fancies. Cassava is an American plant, although the main producers are now in Asia and
Africa...Tapioca pudding is well known as one of the family of British milk puddings.
Like other members of the family, it is sometimes despised by the ignorant, that is to say persons
who have no knowledge of how good they are when properly made....Pearl tapioca, rather than
the quicker cooking flake kind, is preferred for tapioca pudding, and that available in North
America is usually the best..."<br>

"Tapioca is a grainy starch obtained from the fleshy root of the cassava, a tropical American plant
of the genus Manihot. The name for it in the Tupi-Guarani languages of South America is tipioca,
a compound formed from tipi,  'residue' and ok,  squeeze out'; it reflects the way in which the
starch was produced by crushing the root fibres, steeping them in water, and then squeezing all
the liquid out. Spanish and Portuguese changed the word to tapioca, the form adopted in English
in the late eighteenth century. By Mrs. Beeton's time the use of tapioca had become widespread,
and she herself writes in glowing terms of its possession of that elusive quality beloved of
Victorians, digestibility:  Its nutritive properties are large, and as a food for persons of delicate
digestion, or for children, it is in great estimation' (Book of Household Management, 1861(. She
gives a recipe for tapioca soup, in which it was used for thickening broth, but she also of course
mentions tapioca pudding, the tapioca-based milk pudding that for close to the next hundred years
was to be a not altogether welcome staple of the British sweet course."<br>

"Tapioca. Tapioca is procured from a plant which grows in British Guiana, and is known to
botanists by the name of Jatropha, or Manihot Janipha. The tapioca is procured from the root of
the plant which, oddly enough, contains hydrocyanic acid; and it is said that the native Indans
poison their arrows from the juice of the root before they begin preparing the tapioca. The
native cassava is also prepared from the same plant. Tapioca is a wholesome and nutritious
farinaceous food very easy of digestion. It is used for puddings, for thickening soups and sauces,
and it is also simply boiled in milk or water as a food as food for invalids. When mixed with other
flour it will make very good bread. It would be bought of a respectable dealer, as a spurious kind
is sometimes offered for sale made of gum and potato-flour. The jar in the store-cupboard
which contains tapioca should be kept closely covered, or insects will get into it."<br>

"Dust off the welcome mat for a dessert favorite, back now after a five-year wartime qabsencel It's quick-cooking tapioca. Children love it,
and grown-ups go for it, too. Now it's back in countrywide distribution. Desserts aren't all. As a thickener in fruit pies, as a binder in meat
loaves and in fish caseroles, it was a prewar favorite with American cooks. Also, if you want a souffle to stand up striaght and tall at
the dinner table, add a little tapioca to enforce it so itwon't fail. Minute tapioca was a war casualty, and even the 'mock tapioca'
 produced from a laboratory-developed starch-producing grass, was so short in supply that it was merely a drop in the pudding pot. 
For the past five years tapioca has been missing from gorcery shelves because after Pearl Harbor it was no longer possible to import it from 
Java. The consinued unrest in Java postpones tappioca production there indefinitely, so the manufactuers of the family product in its red and 
blue box have turned once again to South America, where tapioca had originated but where relatively little of the special quality required for
the minute variety had previously been produced. But now good supply lines have been set up with Brazil. There's and interesting story behind the oprigin of the 
quick cooking, now familar minute tapioca. A sailor (whose name is not known) really started the buisness. Back in 1894, this sailr who was staying at the
home of Mrs. Susan Stavers, somewhere near Boston, asked for tapioca pudding. When he was served, he complained it was too coarse and lumpy. It
seems he'd tasted better in the tropics! Just as an experiment, he suggested to Mrs. Stavers that she run the tapioca through the coffee

Simple <a href="foodpuddings.html#bread">bread puddings</a> have long been associated with healthy living and
invalid cookery. Summer pudding appears to be a variation on this theme. According to the food
historians, summer pudding, as we know it today, was a British recipe of the 19th century. 
Some were steamed, others
were baked, still others quickly cooked with <a href="foodpuddings.html#tapioca">tapioca</a> (another popular
ingredient for healthy/invalid cookery). The degree of "healthiness", not unlike many dishes
today, depended upon the method of preparation and the selection of ingredients.
<p>

"Summer pudding. A favourite English dessert which combines a mixture of summer fruits with
bread. Redcurrants...and raspberries are the best fruits to use, but some varieties of gooseberry
are suitable, and a small quantity of blackcurrants and very few strawberries may be included. In
autumn, blackberries can be substituted. In other countries, corresponding kinds of berry will do
very well...In the 19th century this pudding seems to have been known as  'hydropathic pudding'
because it was served at health resorts where pastry was forbidden. This name must have begun to
seem unattractive or inappropriate early in the 20th century, when the new name summer
pudding, which is now universally used, began to appear in print. Until recently it was thought
that the earliest recorded use was by Florence Perry (1917) who, on the title page of her attractive
book, styled herself  The Pudding Lady'...However, it has now been established that a missionary
in India, Miss E.S. Poynter (1904), had used the term much earlier, in her book; and that soon
afterwards Miss L. Sykes (c. 1912) used it as the title of a recipe which was even closer than Miss
Poynter's to those now in use."<br>

"Summer pudding. A British pudding or dessert of mixed summer fruit moulded in a pudding

drying, summer pudding was a popular dish for using up day-old or slightly stale bread and a glut
of summer fruit. It is still a popular, fabulous dessert, and it has the advantage of being light but

"Hydropathic Pudding</b><br>
This has many names. It is very nice when properly prepared, and the pudding served very cold. Required: fruit, sugar, and bread.
Cost, variable; generally moderate.<br>
The nicest fruits for this are raspberries or currants, or a mixture, or strawberries, with or without a few red or black currants; 
plums are sometimes used. Take a plain mould, and cut a piece of bread to fit the bottom; then put fingers of bread round; the sides should be 
bevelled a little so that they overlap and prevent the escape of the fruit. The latter is stewed withh enough sugar, and poured in, and
a cover of bread put on. A plate with weights on is put on the top, and the pudding put in a cold place to set.<br>
<i>Another way</i> is to line the mould, and then fil up with layers of bread and fruit; and if the bread is cut very thinly, 
this will be generally liked better than the first mode, as there is less fruit, and it suits the majority better. For a plainer
dish a basin may be used, and slices of bread put to line it entirely; then either of the modes can be followed. These should be turned out with
care, and may be served plain, or with a simply made custard. They are useful for those who cannot take pastry or rich puddings, and

arrowroot. Put this and the juice into a pan and bring to the boil. It should have consistency of thin cream. Leave till
cold. Turn out the pudding, pour over a small quantity of the sauce, and serve the rest in a sauce-boat. Cream may be served

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Spotted Dick & Spotted Dog</b></font><br>
Food historians tell us both spotted dick and spotted dog are suet-based puddings which
descended from <a href="foodpuddings.html#rolypoly">roly-poly recipes</a>. While suet puddings and pies date to
the  Medieval Ages, this particular iteration debuts in the 19th century. Traditional English <a
href="christmasfood.html#plumpudding">plum puddings</a> are similar in method, mode, and
serving suggestions.
<p>
The first printed evidence of the phrase "spotted dick," as it relates to food,  is attributed to
Alexis Soyer, the chef of London's illustrious Reform Club, 1849. Why this term? The <i>Oxford
English Dictionary</i> confirms an 19th century colloquial use of the word  'dick' meaning
pudding. Spotted is assumed to be alluding to the visual effect created by the raisins or sultanas.
Neither the <i>OED</I> nor the food historians offer separate explanations regarding the origin
of the related term "spotted dog" as it relates to food.
<p>
"Spotted dick is a fine old traditional English dish: a sweet suet pudding, typically cylindrical, and
studded with currants or raisins. Its name has made it the target of double entendres as leaden as
the pudding itself often is. The first reference to it comes from the <i>Modern Housewife</i>
(1849), a cookery book for the middle classes by the French chef Alexis Soyer, who settled in
Britain: he gives a recipe, beginning:  Plum Bolster, or Spotted Dick--Roll out two pounds of
paste...have some Smyrna raisins well washed...' And in 1892 the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>
reports that  the Kilburn Sisters...daily satisfy hundreds of dockers with soup and  Spotted Dick'.
The origin of dick is not clear, but there are records of its more general use, meaning  pudding', in
the nineteenth century: an 1883 glossary of Hudderfield terms, for instance, gives Dick, plain
pudding. If with treacle sauce, treacle dick. An alternative name, spotted dog, had appeared by
the middle of the nineteenth century:  For supper came smoking sheep's heads...and "spotted
dog," a very marly species of plum-pudding' (C.M. Smith, <i>Working-men's Way in the

"Spotted Dick and spotted dog are both popular British suet puddings which are  spotted'  with
raisins. Strickly speaking, spotted dick is of the  roly poly' type...with raisins and sugar spread on
a flat sheet which is rolled up; and spotted dog is a plain cylindar with raisins or currants and
sugar mixed with suet paste, so that it has visible spots on the outside. Both, correctly, should be
boiled in a cloth, but are often now baked." <br>

Recipes for spotted dick are hard to find in most period cookbooks. That does not ncecessarily
mean recipes of this sort are omitted. It sometimes means the item is listed under a different name.
There are dozens of variations. Generally, they are noted as "economical" dishes. Compare Mr.
Soyer's recipe with Mrs. Beeton's:
<blockquote>
<b>Soyer [1860]</b><br>
"339. Spotted Dick.--Put three-quarters of a pound of flour into a basin, half a pound of beef suet,
half ditto of currants, two ounces of sugar, a little cinnamon, mix with two eggs and two gills of
milk; boil in either mould or cloth for one hour and a half; serve with melted butter, and a little
sugar over."<br>
---<i>Shilling Cookery for the People</i>, Alexis Soyer, facsimile 1860 reprint edition [Pryor
Publications:Kent] 1999  (p. 130)
<p>
<b>Beeton [1863]</b><br>
"336. Boiled Currant Pudding (Plain and Economical)<br>
Ingredients.--1 lb of flour, 1/2 lb. Of suet, 1/2 lb. Of currants, milk.<br>
Mode.--Wash the currants, dry them thoroughly, and pick away any stalks or grit; chop the suet
finely; mix all the ingredients together, and moisten with sufficient milk to make the pudding into
a stiff batter; tie it up in a floured cloth, put it into boiling water, and boil for 3 1/2 hours; serve
with a cut lemon, cold butter, and sifted sugar.<br>
Time, 3 1/2 hours. Average cost, 10d. Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons. Seasonable, at any time."<br>
---<i>Englishwoman's Cookery Book</i>, Mrs. Isabella Beeton [Ward, Lock, and Tyler:London]
1863 (p. 160)

Food historians tell us spotted dick/dog also sometimes refers to <a
href="foodbreads.html#irishsodabread"> Irish soda bread</a> with raisins:<p>
"In Ireland soda bread is prepared with either white or wholewheat flour. Brown soda bread is
popularly served with smoked salmon. A sweet version of the bread can also be prepared with the
addition of sugar and currants, raisins, or sultanas; this is known by a variety of names including
spotted dick, spotted dog, and railway cake."<br>

<font color="#003366"><b>Queen of puddngs</b></font><br>

According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> (2nd editon, accessed online), "Queen of the Pudding" and "queen's pudding," are one in
the same. This dish is essentially a steamed suet pudding. The oldest print reference provided is from 1884 (Cassell's
Dictionary of Cookery 675/2 'Queen's Pudding.' Food historians tell us this recipe is almost identical to Manchester
pudding, which may indicate where the recipe originated. 
<p>
"Queen's pudding, or queen of the puddings, as the name of a pudding, seems not to have a very long history. As a
dish, however, it apparently goes back to the 17th century. Sir Kenelm Digby (1669) gave a recipe for a dish like
modern queen's pudding: breadcrumbs combined with milk and egg yolks, part baked, and then topped with jam and
meringue made from the whites and baked until done. What queen may have been involved or how is unclear. There
is a recipe for 'Queen Pudding' in Garrett (c. 1825); but it is not the same as queen's pudding above. This same book
does, however, have a recipe for Manchester Pudding, which matches one given by Mrs. Beeton (1861) and may
provide a clue. A Manchester pudding has a layer of puff pastry at the bottom of the dish and does not have a
meringue topping. Otherwise it is more or less the same as queen's pudding. The evidence perhaps suggests that
queen's pudding received its name at about the beginning of the 20th century; and at that time there was only one
queen who could have inspired the name (no doubt after commenting favourably on a helping of Manchester pudding,
possibly in the course of a royal visit to that city) and that of course was Queen Victoria. Be that as it may, queen's
pudding in its modern form is one of the best British puddings."<br>
----<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 644)
<p>
"Queen of Puddings. One of the classic English puddings, queen of puddings consists of bread-crumb and custard
mixture with a layer of jam and then meringue on top. It seems to have originated in the nineteenth century (although
neither Eliza Acton nor Mrs. Beeton mention it.)"<br>

<br>
<blockquote>
<b>[1875]<br>
"Queen's Pudding.</b>--Butter a plain mould or basin rather thickly with butter, flour it well, and stick raisins, slices of
candied peel or dried fruit over the inside rows. Fill the basin with layers of bread and butter, and put between each
layer sugar flavoured with lemon rind, blanched and sliced almonds, and candied peel. Pour over the whole a mint of
milk which has been mixed with four well-beaten eggs. Cover the basin closely, and boil or steam the pudding. Time
to boil the pudding, half an hour. Probable cost, 1s. 2d. Sufficient, if made in a quart mould, for five or six persons."<br>

<font color="#003366"><b>What was roly-poly pudding?</b></font><br>
A survey of period cookbooks confirms this particular pudding was popular in Victorian times. It
was most often served up as a sweet dish, but savory recipes exist as well. It was also referred to
by Charles Dickens (<i>Bleak House</i>) and Beatrix Potter (<i>The Tale of Samuel Whiskers
or The Roly Poly Pudding</i>).
<p>
"Roly-poly pudding, a widely used name for a suet pudding made in a roll shape. The name is
generally given to a pudding with a sweet filling such as jam, or treacle and breadcrumbs, or
mixed dried fruits with marmelade; in each case spread over a flat sheet of dough and rolled
up...Formerly roly-poly pudding was boiled in a pudding cloth; but the skill of enclosing a
pudding of this shape in a cloth has now mostly been lost. Since it could not be adapated to a
basin as could a round pudding, it is now almost invariably baked."<br>

<b>Selected historic recipes</b><br><blockquote>

<b>[1845]<br>
"Rolled pudding.</b><br>
Roll out thin a bit of light puff paste, or a good suet crust, and spread equally over it to within an
inch of the edge, any kind of fruit jam. Orange marmealade, and mincemeat make excellent
varieties of this pudding, and a deeplpayer of fine brown sugar, flavoured with the grated rind and
strained juice of one very large, or of two small, lemons, answers for it extremely well. Roll it up
carefully, pinch the paste together at the ends, fold a cloth round, secure it well at the ends, and
boil the pudding from one to two hours, according to its size and the nature of the ingredients.

quite sufficiently boiled in an hour and a quarter."<br>

<p>

<b>[1875]<br>
"Roly-poly Pudding.</b>--The pastry for this favourite pudding may be made in three or four
ways, according to the degree of richness required. For a superior pudding mix a pound of flour
with a half pound of very finely-shred suet, freed from skin and fibre. Add a good pinch of salt, an
egg, and nearly half a pint of milk. Roll it out three or four times. For a plainer pudding, mix five
or six ounces of suet with a pound of flour, add a pinch of salt, and make a paste by stirring in a
half a pint of water. When suet is objected to, rub six ounces of butter or six ounces of sweet
dripping into a pound of flour, and proceed as before. When a similar quantity still of dripping is
used, the addition of a spoonful of baking-powder sill help to make the pastry light. Roll out the
pastry to a long thin form, a quarter of an inch thick, and of a width to suit the size of the
saucepan in which it is to be boiled. Spread over it a layer of any kind of jam, and be careful that it
does not reach the edges of the pastry. Begin at one end, and roll it up to fasten the jam inside,
moisten the edges and press them securely together. Dip a cloth in boiling water, flour it well, and
tie the pudding tightly in it. Plunge it into a saucepan of boiling water, at the bottom of which a
plate has been laid to keep the pudding from burning, and boil quickly until done enough. If it is
necessary to add more water, let it be put in boiling. Marmalade, treacle, sliced lemon and sugar,
lemon-juice and sugar, chopped apples and currants, either separately of together, may be used
instead of jam for a change. Time to boil the pudding, one hour and a half to two hours, according
to the size."<br>

<p>
<b>What is Zabaglione"</b><p>
"Zabaglione, or zabaione as it is also spelled, is an Italian dessert consisting of egg yolks,
     sugar, and wine (typically Marsala) whisked together over heat until it froths, and generally
     served in glasses."<br>
     ---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 374)
     <p>
     "French borrowed the word sabayon from Italian zabaglione, and the concept too:
     it is a sweet confection made from whipped egg yolks and wine. A fashionable
     late twentieth-century application of it was as a sauce for fruit, flashed briefly
     under the grill. The word sabayon is also used for a sort of whipped-cream sauce
     served with fish."<br>
     ---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford]
     2002 (p. 291)
<p>
<b>Where did the name originate?</b>
     <p>
     "Zabagione is the Anglicized (and internationally current) form of the Italian word which is
     correctly spelled zabaione and which became at the beginning of the 19th century
     sabayon in French. It deontes one of the most luxurious dishes of the caudle type, and is
     generally supposed to have been invented in the early 16th century at the Florentine court
     of the Medici. Egg yolks, Marsala wine, and sugar are beaten vigorously in a double boiler
     until thick and foamy. There are later versions with cream, including a frozen one. Lesley
     Chamberlain...remarks that a version of zabaglione was popular among the Russian
     aristocracy in the late 19th century under the strange name of 'gogol mogol'.  This was at
     the height of Russian-French imperial cuisine, so...presumably arrived in St. Petersburg
     with a French chef who was accustomed to making sabayon. In France the name
     sabayon is also applied to a sauce, which belongs with the sauce called mousseline and is
     often made with champagne, for serving wtih fish or crustaceans."<br>
     ---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999(p.
     863)<br>
     [NOTE: according to this source, "caudle" was originally a hot drink made from ale or
     wine, thickened with egg yolks and sweetened with sugar or honey. It was popular in
     Medieval Europe. By the 16th century the term came to denote a custard-like dessert.]
     <p>
     "Zabione...There are several stories as the name's origin, which seems to be
     Piedmontese. The most common contends the dessert was originally called sanbajun, the
     Piedmontese pronunication for San Giiovanni de Baylon, the patron saint of pastry chefs.
     Others believe it commemorates Carlon Emmanuele I of Savoy or may be derived from
     the word sbaglione (big mistake). Clifford A. Wright, in his book <i>Cucina Paradiso</i> (1992),
     belives the word derives from the Sicilian dialect word zabbina (to whip), which in turn
     comes from Arabic zabad, meaning "foam of water and other things."<br>

<b>Brief survey of recipes through time</b>
<blockquote>
<b>[1891]<br>
"Zabaione</b><br>
 3 egg yolks<br>
30 grams (about 1 ounce) of powdered sugar<br>
1 1-1/2 deciliters (about 3/5 of a cup) equal to approximately nine tablespoons of Cyprus, Marsala or Madeera wine.<br>
Double these amounts to serve eight people. If you prefer it more 'spirited,' add a tablespoon of rum; adding one teaspoon of ground cinnamon
wouldn't be a bad idea either. With a wooden spoon beat the yolks with the sugar until they turn almost white, then add the 
liquid, mix well and put over a high flame, whisking constantly and taking care not to let the mixture boil, because in that case
it would curdle. Remove the zabaione from the flame the moment it begins to turn light and fluffy. In my opinion, it is best to use 
a chocolate pot."<br>---<i>Science in the Kitchen and the Art of Eating Well</i>, Pelligrino Artusi, originally

(9 fl oz or 1 1/8 U.S. cups) dry white wine; place in a pan of very hot water on the side of the stove and whisk the mixture
until it becomes thick and frothy. Flavour to taste with vanilla sugar, orange sugar, lemon sugar, or 3 tbs of a good liqueur
such as Kirsch, Kummel or Rum. Note: Sabayon can be made with other kinds of fine wines such as Madeira, Sherry, Marsala, Asti,
 Champagne etx. In this case the selected wine replaces the white wine and there is no need or any other flavouring."<br>

"Zabaglione</b><br>
One of Italy's most famous and favorite sweets is from the Piedmont. Made with beaten eggs and Marsala, it is served either warm
or chilled in small glasses. It's also considered a great restorative, so much so that it's part of the the language: a losing soccer
player is greeted with jeers of 'Go get yourself a zabaglione!'
<br>
6 egg yolks<br>
6 tablespoons sugar<br>
12 tablespoons Marsala wine<br>
A round-bottom copper bowls is ideal for making zabaglione. Use the bowl as the upper part of a double boiler. If you don't have one, simply
use an ordinary double boiler. Put the egg yolks into whichever container you are using, add the sugar, and beat until very pale
and fluffy. Then put the container in hot but not boiling water, keep on beating until the mixture thickens to the consistency
of a light batter. Remove form the heat, beat a few minutes longer, and our into 6 dessert glasses. It can be served lukewarm
or, if we think it's much better, cold. 
<p>
<b>"Zabaglione Biscui/Neapolitan  Zabaglione</b><br>

1/2 cup all-purpose cream<br>
Make the zabaglione as described in the preceding recipe. When it is the consistency of a light batter, beat the egg whites until they
are stiff and fold them gently into the zabaglione. Whipe the cream and fold that in, too. Spoon the mixture into 6 dessert 
glasses or custard cups and place them in the freezer for half an hour."<br>
