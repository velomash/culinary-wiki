Archaeologists tell us humans have been eating crustaceans (lobsters, crabs, shrimp) from
prehistoric
times to present. They know this from excavating "middens," deposits of shells and bones left by
early
civilizations. These foods weren't "discovered" (like early people "discovered" some corn popped
if placed
near the fire) but noticed. The earliest hunter-gatherers took advantage of every available food
resource.
People who lived near water (oceans, seas, lakes, rivers) naturally took advantage of the foods
offered by
these resources.

Culinary evidence confirms lobsters were known to ancient Romans and Greeks. The were highly
esteemed by the British, not so esteemed by American colonists. This sea creature enjoyed a
resurgence
of demand in the 19th century which still holds true today.
<P>
"Lobster, well-armed sea creature. Its most noticeable external traits were its  long hands and
small feet' (Archestratus), its  bent fingers (Epicharmus) and its dark color (Pliny). It is very
good, albeit somewhat complicated, to eat; simpler for the eventual diner if the cook minces the
meat and forms it into cakes, as described in Apicius...The lobster (Homarus Gammarus) is Greek
askakos..., Latin astacus and elephantus; the latter name is seldom attested in classical texts but
was certainly in use, since it survives in modern Italian dialects."<br>
---<i>Food in the Ancient World From A-Z</i>, Andrew Dalby [Routledge:London] 2003 (p.
198)
<p>
"So the Romans who came to Britain [43 AD] and who lived within reach of the sea must have
been very happy to enjoy the local seafhish...seafoods such as crab and lobster were taken.
Shellfish of many kinds became very popular" (p. 21)
"Lobster, crayfish and crab were greatly enjoyed [in mid-fifteenth century Britain], though   they
seldom reached the inland eater...Crab and lobster were also boiled and eaten cold with vinegar,
as were shrimps." (P. 43)
"During the eighteenth century...Lobsters, crabs, shrimps and prawns continued to be enjoyed."
(p. 48-9)
"In Victorian times...Lobster, crabs, shrimps and prawns could be dressed in many ways, but the
commonest was to boil them to eat cold. After being simmered in a brine of water and Bay salt in
a fish kettle, lobsters could either be eaten immediately, or kept as long as a quarter of a year,
wrapped in brine-soaked rags and buried deep in sand." (p. 55)<br>

[Academy Chicago:Chicago] 1991

"Lobster, much as today, was considered especially elegant and appropriate food for lovers, being
an aphrodesiac. There is a common perception that lobster was considered a poor man's food,
and this many have been in the case in colonial New England but not back in Europe. In fact
English man-about-town Samuel Pepys's diary records than an elegant dinner he thew in 1663
included a fricassee of rabbit and chickens, carp, lamb, pigeons, various pies and four
lobsters..Lobster was cooked either by roasting, boiling or by removing the meat from the shell
and cooking it separately."<br>
---<i>Food in Early Modern Europe</i>, Ken Albala [Greenwood Press:Westport CT] 2003 (p.

"The American lobster (Homarus americanus) is today on of the more expensive food items on
the market, owing to the difficulty of obtaining sufficeint quantities to meet the demand. But when
the first Europeans came to America, the lobster was one of the most commonly found
crustaceans. They sometimes washed up on the beaches of Plymouth, Massachusetts, in piles of
two feet high. These settlers approached the creatures with less than gustator enthusiasm, but the
lobsters' abundance mande them fit for the tables of the poor...In 1622 Governor William
Bradford of the Plymouth Plantation apologized to a new arrival of settlers that the only dish he
"could presente their friends with was a lobster...without bread or anyhting else but a cupp of fair
water." Lobsters in those days grew to a tremendous size, sometimes forty or more pounds...The
taste for lobster developed rapidly in the nineteenth century, and commercial fisheries specializing
in the crustacean were begun in Maine in the 1840s, thereby giving rise to the fame of the "Maine
lobster," which was being shipped around the world a decade later. In 1842 the first lobster
shipments reached Chicago, and Americans enjoyed them both at home and in the cities' new
"lobster palaces," the first of which was built in New York by the Shanley brothers...Diamond Jim
Brady thought nothing of downing a half-dozen in addition to several other full courses...By 1885
the American lobster industry was providing 130 million pounds of lobster per year. So afterward
the population of the lobster beds decreased rapidly, and by 1918 only 33 million pounds were
taken."<br>

York] 1999 (p. 186)<br>

Newburg, lobster a l'americaine, and lobster fra diavolo. If you need these ask your librarain to

"In 1621 Edward Winslow reported to a friend back in England concerning the Plymouth settlement that "our Bay is full of Lobsters
all the Summer." In Salem a few years later, Francis Higginson observed that "the least Boy in the Plantation may both catch
and eat what he will of" lobters. Lobsters were not only plentiful in early New England, they were large.Higginson reported some
weighing twenty-five pounds. But lobsters were not always a welcome sight on early colonial tables. As noted above, in 1623 Governor
Bradford complained of having only lobster to serve visitors...Early New Englanders would have been perplexed to find lobsters
grouped, as they were by one twentieth-century writer, with caviar and filet mignon...No delicacy, American lobsters were nonetheless
better received than many shellfish. They were soon being cooked much the same way as their smaller European counterparts, in sauces
for other fish, or as accompaniments to roasts...When not potting lobsters, baking them in pies or using them in sauces, 
eighteenth- and nineteenth-century New England cooks were apt to stew or fricassee them...Boiled lobsters were served cold with dressing, not hot and "in the rough,"
as we are most likely to encounter them today. In the 1840s, [Catharine] Beecher...presented boiled lobster served in this
fashion...The American taste for lobster was on the rise...When nineteeth-century canning methods, developed around 1840 and 
perfected during the Civil War, were redirected toward peacetime activities, lobsters were among the most popular canned
products. By 1880, there were twenty-three lobster canneries in Maine...Fresh lobsters, made more widely available by improved
transportation, were increasingly preferred."<br>

<b>Is it true that in Colonial New England it was against the law to serve lobster more than three times a week to servants? No. Food historian
Sandy Oliver elucidates:</b>
<blockquote>
"The lobster and salmon story is one of the most frequently told about New England seafood. It generally goes like this: Salmon and lobster "used to be so abundant that, it is said, " pick one---the apprentices, servants, boarders, lumbermen, occupants, prisoners, and slaves of-pick another--Newcastle, England, Boston or Lowell, Massachusetts, Puget Sound, Bristol, Rhode Island, Islesboro, Maine, the Maine State Prison, or the South-refused to eat either lobsters or salmon, more than twice a week. Recent versions of the story usually feature lobster, but the vast majority of accounts prefer salmon. 
All the stories have in common some group of people who have no control over their food choices, people who have to eat what is served them. The stories all explain that these sufferers had a meeting to form a complaint presented to an official in charge. The story, substantiated only by reference to an alleged expert who "has it on good authority" or words to that effect, is usually put in the context of former natural abundance. So the tale is reported second hand, refers to a time from fifty to one hundred years earlier than the usual late 1800s publishing date. The most common sources for this particular tale are town histories which abounded in the nineteenth century often written by a local antiquarian, though it appears also in George Brown Goode's The Fisheries and Fishery Industries of the United States published in 1887. Lack of primary evidence is the main reason to doubt this story. No minutes of these indignation meetings, nor ordinances outlawing sea food more than twice a week, have ever emerged. But why salmon, why lobster, why twice a week?
The stories appear when salmon or lobster are becoming historically scarce, when the author wants to recall a distant, more abundant past. Twice a week was for 
many in early England or the colonies, the number of fast days a week on which one customarily ate fish. As Protestantism neglected religious fasts marked by fish 
consumption, the idea of having to eat fish more than one's religion formerly required sounded like an imposition on people who always preferred meat to fish."<br>

<font color="#003366"><b>Rock lobster</b> (aka crayfish)</font>
<p>
Rock lobster is another name for spiny lobster, a popular warm-water crustacaen. In some parts
of the world it is also known as crayfish or crawfish, which accounts for the confusion between
rock lobster and <a href="foodlobster.html#crawfish">American crawfish</a>. Old World crayfish are the primary flavoring in 
<a href="foodsauces.html#nantua">Sauce Nantua</a>. 
<p>
"Rock lobster. Apparently Americans find the name crawfish a gastronomic turn-off, for when
theis crustacean appears on restaurant menus or is canned or frozen for sale, it often goes under
the disguise of rock lobster (originally an alternative name for the spiny lobster)."<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p.
284)
<p>
"Spiny lobster, the correct name for crustaceans of the family Paniluridae, is prefereable to the
name crawfish which is sometimes used by invited confusion with crayfish. Needless to say, using
the name crayfish or cray, as sometimes in Australia, is even more likely to cause confustion. The
spiny lobsters are indubitably lobsters, bu they differ from the archetypal lobsters of the N.
Atlantic in having no claws and in belonging to warmer waters. Indeed they are most abundant in
the tropics...Their size and the excellence of their meat ensures that they are in strong demand,
although the question whether they are better than or inferior to the common lobster is and will no
doubt for ever be debated. Such debate is complicated by the fact that the established recipes for
the Atlantic lobster, generally speaking, have been those of classical French cuisine plus the more
robust tradtitions evolved in N. America; whereas the spiny lobster, with its worldwide range in
warmer waters, has attracted to itself a large number of recipes involving tropical or subtropical
ingredients."<br>

"...millions of other lobsters come from South Africa, South America, Mexico, Australia, and
elsewhere, usually in the form of "spiny lobsters," sometimes called "crawfish" but distinct from
the true native freshwater crayfish...Spiny lobster. (Panlirus argus). A favorite Floridian species,
the spiny lobster ranges from the Carolinas to the Caribbean and is related to a Californian
species., P. Interruptus. At market, spiny lobsters are often called "rock lobsters."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New
York] 1999 (p. 186-7)
<p>
"Rock lobster.  A market name for the spiny lobster. Large quantities of South African and
Australian "rock lobsters" are imported to the U.S. annually, as our demand exceeds the local
supply. They are also imported from Chile and New Zealand. Although these imports represent a
different genus (Jasus), they are of the same family and form a culinary standpoint are no different
from a spiny lobster taken in North American waters...Spiny lobster: In the western Atlantic the
spiny lobster...ranges from North Carolina and Bermuda to Brazil, through the southern Gulf of
Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. It is most abundant in Florida, Bahamas, Cuba and British
Honduras...Closely related species occur in California. Sometimes called crawfish, and
misleadingly crayfish, the spiny lobster like other members of this family (Palinuridae) has 5 pairs
of legs but no claws. Thus, its tail portion provides the bulk of the meat. Compared to the
American lobster its texture is coarser but of good flavor and tender when freshly prepared.
Although 6 species of spiny lobster occur in the western Atlantic, the differences are taxonomical
rather than culinary, and they are all generally similer in appearance; numerous spines cover the
body, with 2 large, hooked horns over the eyes...It is a beautifully marked crustacean with
browns, yellows, orange, green and blue mottled over the upper parts and underside of the
tail...Spiny lobster tails can be boiled, steamed, deep-fried or broiled, or the raw meat can be
removed for the shell and used in any of the prepared dishes such a scurries, thermidors,
newburgs or salads. Never bake it, as the musculature will tighten like a drumhead."<br>

<b>ABOUT AMERICAN CRAYFISH & CRAWFISH</b>
<p>
"Crayfish. Also, "crawfish," "crawdad," crawdaddy," and "Florida lobster." Any of these various
freshwater crustaceans of the genera Canbarus and Astacus. Although considerably smaller, the
crayfish remembles the lobster, and there are 250 species and subspecies found in North America
alone. The name is from Middle English crevise, and, ultimately, from Frankish krabtija. Crayfish
formed a significant part of the diet of the Native Americans of the South and still hold their
highest status among the Cajuns of Louisiana. Louisanans have an enourmous passion and
appetitie for what they call "crawfish" (a name used by Captain John Smith as early as
1615)...The crayfish figures in Louisiana folklore, and the natives hold "crayfish boils" whenever
the crustacean is in season. Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, calls itself the "Crawfish Capitol of the
World" and to prove it, cooking up crayfish in pies, gumbos, stews, and every other way
imaginable. Yet one would not easily find a crawfish on restaurant menus in Louisiana much
before 1960 because they were considered a common food to be eaten at home. Crayfish are
commercially harvested in waters of the Mississippi basin, most of them of the Red Swamp and
white River varieties, with the season running approximately form Thanksgiving Day to the
Fourth of July..."Cajun popcorn" is a dish of battered, deep-fried crayfish popularized by Cajun
chef Paul Prudhomme in the 1980s."<br>

<font color="#003366"><b>Lobster Fra Diavolo</b></font>
<p>

Where did Lobster Fra Diavolo originate? Like many popular Italian-American dishes, there are several theories. What is 
the true evolution of Lobster Fra Diavolo? Our survey of historic recipes suggests it might have been a complicated
mix of Italian ingenuity inspired by French fare demanded by American customers. 
Why? Traditional Italian "diavolo" recipes employ chicken but not tomatoes. French 
"diable"-type recipes combine chicken and tomato puree. Lobster American style employs (in French, Englsih and American cookbooks)
demands tomatoes in some form. Most, but not all, rely on cayenne pepper to invoke the *devil*. About <a href="foodeggs.html#devil">devilled foods</a>.
<p>
"Lobster Fra Diavolo. A recipe of elusive origin. I'd always thought lobster Fra Diavolo Italian, probably southern Italian, but I do not pretend to be an expert on 
thee cookingof that extraordinary country. Then, just as I was putting this book to bed, along comes a New York Times article (May 29, 1996 p. C3) suggesting
 that this rich dish--chunks of lobster, still in the shell, bedded on pasta and smothered with a spicy tomato sauce--was created early this century by Italian
 immigrants in or around New York City. Like spaghetti and meatballs...Florence Fabricant...doesn't proclaim that lobster Fra Diavolo is American. Instead, she 
queries the experts, such respected writers on and teachers of Italian cooking as Marcella Hazan...Hazan remembers eating Lobster Fra Diavolo in 1940 at Grotta
 Azzura, a restaurant opened in New York's Little Italy in 1908..."I remember the dish clearly," Farbicant quotes Hazan as saying, "because it was so heavy and
 typical of Italian cooking in America. We con't eat like that in Italy." Anna Teresa Callen concurs. "It's not an Italian dish,"..."It's really another Italian-American
 invention. I have never seen it in Italy and suspect that it came from Long Island." Bugialli, like Hazan and Callen, scoffs at the notion that Lobster Fra Diavolo is an
 Italian classic. "We don't even have American lobsters in Italy,"..."And a heavy tomato sauce with hot peppers, seafood, and pasta all in one dish is not Italian 
cooking. I think it came from a restaurant that was near the old Met, around Thirty-eighth Street and Broadway. Would that have been the old Mama Leone's?
 It opened behind the Met in 1906. Restauranteur Tony May, a Neapolitan, says he never heard of Lobster Fra Diavolo until he arrived in New York in 1963. He 
thinks Veusvio, a midtown Manhattan restaurant, might have invented it. But Frank Scognamillo, the owner of Pastys'...begs to differ. His father, Pasquale, 
emigrated from Naples to New York in the early 1920s and opened Patsy's in 1944, Lobster Fra Diavolo was a house specialty...Scognamillo says his father told 
him Lobster Fra Diavolo was a Neapolitan dish, and that like many other spicy, tomatoey recipes of southern Italy, it was handed down for generations....With all
 due respect to Scognamillo and Davino---I tend to think Hazan, Bugialli, Callen "and company" nearer the mark."<br>

"Lobster fra diavolo. An Italian-American dish whose name translates as "Lobster Brother Devil" made with lobster cooked in a spicy, peppery tomato sauce. It 
was a creation of Southern Italian immigrants, who did not have American lobsters in Italy (in Itlay dishes termed "alla diavolo" indicate on made with a good deal of 
coarsley ground black pepper), and became a popular dish in Italian-American restaurants in New York by the 1940s."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 187)
<p>
The oldest print reference we have for serving Lobster fra Diavolo indicates the dish may have been served in New York City, 1908:<br>
"One of the best restaurants in the city specializing in Italian food--and one of the oldest, since it was founded in 1908, is Enrico & Paglieri, 66 West Eleventh Stree,
 in Greenwich Village...Back in the days when Enrico and his partner, Paul Paglieri, who died many years ago, started their venture, the menu seldom varied from 
minestrone, lobster diavolo and chicken. This was a concession to the customers of the time, who clamored for those dishes, Enrico explains, and how, incidentally
 paid only 55 cents for a complete meal, including a bottle of wine."<br>
---"News of Food: Italian Meals Served in Outdoor Setting in Restaurant Opened in 'Village' in 1908," <i>New York Times</i>, June 24, 1946 (p. 34)<br>
[NOTE: Is it possible Enrico & Paglieri's
was referring to French cuisine when he said his customers were clamoring for *this* type of food? <a href="foodlobster.html#1961diavolo">
James Beard's classic recipe</a> c. 1961 offers a compelling argument.]
<p>
"One of the most discussed questions on gastronomy is the case of lobster a l'americaine. For a long time specialists have maintained,
since no American dish has ever seen the fire of French stoves, that this dish must be called lobster a l'armoricaine, "Armorique"
being the ancient name for Brittany. Now it would appear that if by definition a regional dish is one composed of local
products--the vegetables, the fish, and the wines--it is difficult to understand why Brittany, with its scarcity of 
tomatoes, not too plentiful Cognac, supplying only the lobster, could claim the credit for the dish. Also, the great chefs have 
continued to baptize the dish homard a l'americaine. If we believe the latter version, accepted in the realm of 
Good Cheer, this fanciful name was one invented on spot to suit the occasion. This dish apparently saw the light of day before
1870, in Noel Peter restaurant in Paris, where chef Fraisse commanded the cooking brigade after the dinner hour and just before 
closing, demanding and insisting that Peters serve them dinner. The only things the kitchen could provide at this late hour
were some live lobsters--and there was no time to cook them in court-bouillon. A flash of inspiration, and a new dish was
born. The enthusiastic and grateful guests demanded to know the name of this new dish. Peters, still under the influence of hsi
recent trip to America, replied off-hand and with out thinking: "Le homard a l'americaine."...it is now proven and accepted
that a Parisian restaurant was the cradle of this dish..."<br>

 Mariani's observations. This books was the "Zagats" of its day. It is interesting to note entries for Enrico & Paglieri's, Vesuvio's, Leone's or Paty's

eats it feels his mouth on fire and is tempted to send both the chicken and whoever cooked it to the devil. I shall give a simplr, 
more civilized way to prepare it: Take a cockerel or young chicken, remove the head, neck and feet, and, after cutting it open
all the way down the front, flatten it out as much as you can. Wash and dry it well with a kitchen towel, then place it on 
the grill. When it begins to brown, turn it over, brush with melted butter or olive oil and season with salt and pepper. When the 
other side begins to brown, turn the chicken over again and repeat the procedure. Continue to baste and season as necessary until
done. Cayenne pepper is sold as red powder, which comes from England in little glass bottles."<br>

<a name="newberg">
<font color="#003366"><b>Lobster Newberg</b></font><br>
Lobster Newburg first surfaces in the 1880s. Its was among the most popular dishes served in the American Pavilion at the
<a href="restaurants.html#1900paris">Paris Exposition of 1900</a> and the <a href="foodlobster.html#newburg1893">Columbian Exposition in
 Chicago 1893</a>.  Where 
did this dish originate and how did it get its name?
There are several interesting versions of the "official" story. Most agree on two points: the restaurant making this dish famous (Delmonico's)
and the person for whom the dish was named (Ben Wenberg). The story of tbe morphing from "Wenberg" to "Newburg" is fuzzy.
 This entertaining yarn provides the most detail:
<p>
"Of all the 'characters' who passed through Delmonico's hospitable doors--at Fourtheenth Street and also at Twenty-sixt--few were as odd,
and none was so unlucky, as the man who just missed having his name on the tongues of millions through generations unborn. Ben
Wenberg was a sea captain engaged in the fruit trade between Cuba and New York. When on shore, he bivouacked at 
Delmonico's. In
regard to his food and attire he was extremely fastidious: no salty pea jacket or rakis nautical cap for him; he was a dandy.
His usual costume was a long Prince Albert coat of fine cloth with a diagonal weave, pantaloons tailored snug and shaped to
his instep, high-heeled boots with pointed toes made of glove leather to his order by Adam Young, the fashionable bootmaker, and the
latest thing on shiny toppers crowning his iron-grey curly hair. Ben Wenberg allowed no one to come between him and the
table; yet though he ate industriously, he was as thin as a rail. One day in 1876, home from a cruise, he entered a cafe at
Madison Square and announced that he had brough back a new way to cook lobster. Calling for a blazer (a chafing dish with spirit
lamp), he demonstrated his discovery by cooking the dish beside his tale, and invited Charles Delmonico ('Old Charley') to taste. Charles
said, 'Delicious!' and forthwith entered the dish on the restaurant menu, naming it in honor of its inventor, or at least its
introducer to New York, Lobster a la Wenberg. It caught the public fancy and became a standby of the after-theater suppers that were
in vogue, and Wenberg preened himself upon having perpetuated his name to the remotest posterity. Unfortunately, he and 'Charley' had
a falling out. The cause is not known, but the consequence was devastating to Wenberg's expectations of gastronomic
immortality. Charles erased the dish from the menu; but since patrons kept calling for it, he was forced to compromise.
By typographical sleight-of-hand, he reversed the spelling of 'Wen" to 'New" and Lobster a la Newberg was born. Such was the
power of Delmonico. A man who witnessed Ben's initial preparation of the dish recounted the scene thirty years afterwards, and recalled
particularly that at the end Wenberg took from his pocket a small flask, and shook into the pan a little of the reddish powder it
contained--the inevitable 'secret ingredient.' Delmonico's cooks were satisfied that the stuff was only cayenne pepper, though
Ben never told. This same witness of Wenberg's first demonstration maintained that the dish, when 'made to perfection,' should
contain only 'lobster, sweet cream, unsalted butter, French congac, dry Spanish sherry, and cayenne pepper.' The recipe
standardized by Charles Ranhofer departed from this formula, and for those who may wonder how Lobster a la Newberg (or a la Delmonico,
as it was interechangeably called) was prepared at its birthplace, here is the Delmonico recipe ver batim." [See recipes below, 1967]<br>
---<i>Delmonico's: A Century of Splendor</i>, Lately Thomas [Houghton Mifflin Company:Boston] 1967 (p. 220-222)
<p>
The more popular version of this story casts Ben Wenburg as a business man who requests his name not be connected
with the dish:<p> "If you are a gourmet you like lobster. The man who made lobster a la Newburg famous refused to have his name to 
with it. He gave Delmonico the recipe, and Del gave the delicacy the name it bears today, while that of the benefactor is never heard
outside of the little circle in which he lived. Well, the creator of the dish was Benjamin Wenburg, a New York broker. He used to take his
luncheons at Delmonico's downtown place, not many blocks from the Battery. When he told Del how to make lobster a la Newburg--it had no name
then--Del put it on his bill and called it lobster a la Wenburg. Wenburg got angy about it and told Delmonico if he didn't remove his
name he would feed elsewhere. The big caterer reversed the first syllable and the title has been what you have been accustomed to see ever
since."<br>
---"Naming a Famous Dish," <i>Monticello Express</i> [IA], April 25, 1917 (p. 10)
<p>
Other "creation" stories credit Delmonico chefs inventing this dish for regular customer Wenberg, naming it in his honor.
Wenberg refused. Presumably, there was a disagreement between Wenberg and someone at Delmonico's but the details are 
lost. 
<p>
What's the true story?
We may never know. It strikes us unlikely that any patron, no matter how talented in the culinary arts, would publicly introduce a 
a dish at Delmonico's. But it was a different time and place and anything is possible. The fact that none of these stories agree 
on the correct spelling of Benjamin Wenburg/Wenberg's (Newberg/Newburg) name
may or may not mean anything. Style manuals with standardized spelling are a relatively new concept in media reportage. 
Sometimes, like familiar tales recounted at family meals, it makes more sense to understand the glory of the story. One fact
is certain: tableside chafing dish recipes reigned supreme in this period. What better way to promote any dish than to engage
a fanciful story featuring one of the world's most renown restaurants? Lobster Newburg's real legacy is staying power. Brilliant!
<p>
We find no print references/recipes for chafing dish lobster Wenberg/Wenburg to date. The New York Public Library's
historic menu collection returns the earliest print reference, for <a href="http://menus.nypl.org/menus/25949">Terrapine
a la Newburg</a>, served at Delmonicos c. 1884. No recipe; we cannot confirm if this item was similar to later iterations. 
The earliest Lobster Newburg recipe we've found to date was published in 1887. Newspapers confirm the popularity of the dish: "The demonstration lesson at the Boston Cooking School Wednesday morning...Lobster Newberg" (<i>Boston
Daily Globe</i>, April 4, 1899 (p. 4). The dish appears regularly on fine dining menus, along with <a href="foodsoups.html#turtle">Turtle Soup</a> and
other delicacies. This article pokes fun at this trendy dish by defining it: "Lobster-Newberg--A dish ordered at hotels by those who

If provision is to be made for six or eight persons, use the meat of a lobster weighing about four pounds, or that of two small 
lobsters, four table-spoonfuls of butter, two of brandy, two of sherry, two teaspoonfuls of salt, one-fourth of a teaspoonful of
pepper, half a pint of cream, the yolks of four eggs, and a slight grating of nutmeg. Cut the meat of the lobster into small, 
delicate slices. Put the butter on the stove in a frying-pan, and when it becomes hot, put in the lobster. Cook slowly for five
minutes; then add the salt, pepper, sherry, brandy and nutmeg, and simmer five minutes longer. Meanwhile beat the yolks of the eggs
well, and add the cream to them. Pour the liquid over the cooking mixture, and stir constantly for one minute and a half. Take from the
fire immediately at the end of that time, and serve in a warm dish. Lobster Newburg may be served as a fish course in a dinner or
luncheon. A garnish of trianguar bits of puff paste may be added, or the lobster may be served on toast. No mode of cooking lobster

popular sauce is 100 per cent French, although its name is American. The Frenc chef of the old Delmonico's in New York was the one who 
originally conceived this culinary creation. The name of the town up on the Hudson River had no connection whatsoever with 
this
sauce. Delmonico's wanted to honor one of its best cash customers, by the name of Wenburg, and named this sauce in his honor. Mr. 
Wenburg accepted only on the condition that the three letters of the first syllable of his name be reversed--hence Newburg. The
original recipe was first intended for lobster, but like many others, this sauce may be used for almost any kind of reheated
food, including fish, meats, eggs, game, and vegetables. Here is the original recipe as prepared by its creater, 
French Chef Pascal of the Old Delmonico's:<p>
Cut a live lobster into small pieces and saute it in 2 generous tablespoons of sweet butter. Remove the lobster to a hot platter and keet
it hot. To the butter and lobster juices remaining in the pan, add 2 tablespoons of sherry wine, and scrape and stir at the same
time, from bottom and sides of the frying pan, so as to remove all the gelatinous particles which may adhere (the French culinary
term for this procedure is called 'deglace'). Then, slowly stir in 1 cup of hot, sweet, heavy cream, blending thoroughly. Let this 
simmer very gently for 15 minutes; strain through a fine sieve into a saucepan; return to a gentle flame, and allow the
sauce to reduce to half its original volume, stirring occasionally; then stir in 1/2 cup of hot Bechamel sauce...Boil up once or twice, taste for seasoning
and stir in the cooked lobster coral, then, when thofoughly blended, the lobster pieces (or any other kind of cooked fish, meat,
eggs and so forth) alternately with 4 tablespoons of Hollandaise sauce...Serve at once, as this sauce cannot wait, and does not keep
long. For a dish supreme, add 1 generous tablespon of finely chopped black truffles."<br>

"Lobster a la Newberg, or Delmonico</b><br>
Cook six lobsters each weighing about two pounds in boiling salted water for twenty-five minutes. Twelve pounds of live lobster when cooked
yields from two to two and a half pounds of meat with three to four ounces of coral. When cold detach the bodies from the tails and cut the latter itno sliceds;
put them inta a sautoir [saucepan], each piece lying flat, and add hot clarified butter; season with salt and fry lightly
 on both sides without coloring; moisten to their height with good raw cream; reduce quickly to half; and then add two or three
spoonfuls of Madeira wine; boil the liquid once more only, then remove and thicken with a thickening of egg yolks and raw
cream. Cook without boiling, incorporating a little cayenne and butter; then arrange the pieces in a vegetable dish and pour
the sauce over."<br>

<font color="#003366"><b>Lobster rolls</b></font>
<p>
Sometimes...the simpler the recipe the more complicated the history. Such is the case with lobster
rolls. When it comes
to lobster rolls, food historians generally agree on two points: 
<p>
1. There is no one single recipe for lobster rolls.<br>
2. Lobster rolls, as we know them today,  are probably a 20th century invention because they
require soft hot dog buns.
<p>
<b>What is a lobster roll?</b><br>
There seem to be two primary versions of the lobster roll: one is a mayonnaise-based lobster salad
sandwich and the other is simply composed of hearty chunks of fresh lobster meat drenched in
butter. Both are traditionally served in long (hot-dog type) buns which may be toasted. Pickles
and chips are the usual accompaniments. Both are considered standard menu items with
shore-based restaurants, diners and lobster shacks (inexpensive family-style outdoor eateries).  
<p>
"ON A ROLL...
Temperature's rising, the surf's pounding, the lobster harvest is at an all-time high. Bring on the
lobster rolls!       
The roll: It must be a stand-alone hot-dog bun, rectangular, flat on both sides, coming to a crisp
right angle at the flat base. If it's oval or toasted, do not touch it. If it's not buttered, do not even
look at it. 
     The meat: It must be fresh and predominantly from the tail. It must be at least three inches
wide at the top, extending at least an inch above the crest of the bun. No less than a
quarter-pound of lobster per sandwich. Some joints boast that they use a full lobster in each
sandwich, but it takes nearly five lobsters to get a pound of meat. 
     The dressing: The lobster may be mixed with a thin lather of mayo but not salad dressing. Dick
Henry, co-owner of the Maine Diner, believes in naked lobster. "All meat," he says. I, however,
will accept celery, if finely chopped. "It gives a hint of the taste," agrees Billy Tower, who has
sold lobster rolls for four decades at Barnacle Billy's restaurant. 
     The temp: Like a hot-fudge sundae, the ideal lobster roll is a contradiction of temperatures:
warm bun, chilled meat. "I'm 60 years old, and that's the way I've always been told it should be,"
says Georgia Kennett of Five Islands Lobster Co. But it has become quite respectable to serve the
meat hot, in which case the lobster should be covered with drawn butter, not mayonnaise, and
eaten with a fork and knife."<br>
---"On a roll," David Shribman, <i>Fortune</i>, 8.13.2001 (p. 198)
<p>
A survey of current online menus confirms there is no distinct geographic boundary that separates
the two versions. You can find both versions in restaurants from the top of Maine to the tip Long
Island.

lobster roll"...According to Carolyn Wyman...lobster meat drenched in butter and served on a
hamburger or hot dog roll has long been available at seaside eateries in Connecticut and may well
have originated at a restaurant named Perry's in Milford, where owner Harry Perry concocted it

cook until it reaches the yellow stage, but not a moment longer. Mix one rounded tablespoonful
flour with a teaspoonful (or more, according to taste) of curry powder and stir into the hot butter.
Add a cup hot milk or thick cream and stir until it thickens and is smooth and creamy. Add two
cups of the diced lobster meat, and as soon as thoroughly heated serve on delicately browned

<p>
According to the <i>Encyclopedia American</i>a [1995 edition] there are approximately 4,500
different
species of
crabs living on Earth. They are distributed throughout the world. This means? It is probably
impossible to tell
for sure who (much less where!) ate the first crabs. Food historians tell us crabs were known to
ancient
Greeks and Romans. How do they know? Art and literature. Historians also tell us crabs were not
well liked
by these ancient Mediterranean people as food.
<p>
"Crab, group of water creatures characterised by their hard, round, flat shells. Several of the

<p>
"Medieval period...The distribution of the more usual forms of fish was carried out mainly by the fishmongers, who had their own guild in London by the middle of
 the twelfth century. The varied range of their merchandise can be gathered from the accounts of Daniel Rough, who was the common clerk of Romney, Kent from 
1353 to 1380 , and a fishermonger as well. His stock included 'oysters, crabs, trout, sprats, porpoise, salmon, haddock, lampreys, mackerel, codling, conger eel,

"The early history of crab consumption reflects highly regional tastes...Because of the
labor-intensive effort of harvesting crabs, in colonial times the meat was used in small amounts (as
was
most shellfish) in soups, stews, sauces, and, like other flaked fish, in small fried cakes. Some
recipes suggested that other shellfish could be substituted for crab. Blue crab fanges from
Delware to Florida but that from Chesapeake Bay is most famous...Snow crab, sometimes called
queen-crab...from the colder waters of the North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans, appeared on
the market in the 1960s...Alaska king crab is highly prized for its large meaty claws and

"Outdoor "crab feasts" are common enough on Maryland's Eastern Shore, the live hard-shell
crabs being forced into a makeshift container...to be steamed in hotly spiced vinegar

delicious of the region's springtime specialties...The soup is based on a combination of the meat

coasts of North America. Stone crabs, common from North Carolina to Texas, remain abundant
in Florida and the Keys, and are trapped around Beaufort, North Carolina, and Charleston, South
Carolina. There antebellum cooks used to stew them in white wine lace with vinegar; then with a
seasoning of nutmeg and anchovy the cook would heat the crab with a good deal of butter and
egg yolks, serving it on a large crab shell as a second course...In whatever way it comes to the
kitchen, crab meat moves inventive cooks to improvise and sometimes to include extenders
among the ingredients for a crab dish...Soft-shell crabs are another matter. They are the blue crabs

Crab cakes, as we Americans know them today, are most often associated with Maryland and the
Chesapeake Bay area.
They are considered a popular traditional specialty. How did this recipe evolve? Food historians
tell us the practice of
making minced meat cakes/patties (seafood/landfood) is ancient. Minces mixed with
bread/spices/fillers came about for two reasons: taste and economy. Primary evidence suggests
recipes for crab-cake types dishes were introduced to the colonies by English settlers. About <a

<p>
A survey of historic American cookbooks confirms crab recipes were popular from colonial days
forward. In the 19th century crab recipes proliferated. Many of these combined bread crumbs and
spices; some were fried. These recipes are variously  called "to stew crabs," "to fry crabs," "to
dress crab," "crab patties" or "crab croquettes." Sometimes they stand alone, others they are
noted as possible variations under similar fish/shellfish recipes. The phrase "crab cake" appears to
be a 20th century  appellation.

<font color="#003366"><b>Crab rangoon</b></font><br>
While fried <a href="foodasian.html#wantons">wantons</a> filled with seafood and vegetables were known to ancient Chinese cooks, crab
rangoon is most definately a very modern convention. Why? Cream cheese (indeed, nearly all dairy
products) is not indigenous to Chinese cuisine.  The earliest mention we find for crab rangoon was
printed in a <i>New York Times</i> (no recipe) April 28, 1958 (p. 18) in a review of Trader
Vic's at the Savoy-Plaza. Decription reads "This is a crab meat deep-fried in a crisp, thin shell."
There is no mention whether the reviewer (Craig Claiborne) liked these or not. The earliest recipe
we have for Crab Rangoon was published by Trader Vics in the 1960s. 
<p>
This makes perfect sense. After World War II Chinese, Japanese and Polynesian foods were considered
exotic and trendy. Many traditional foods were adapted to suit American tastes and ingredients. Some of
these, (possibly because Americans were used to the flavor mixed with crab), included cream cheese.

<a name="shrimp">
<font color="#003366"><b>About shrimp</b></font><br>
Shrimp to some, <a href="foodlobster.html#prawn">prawns</a> to others. These curious crustaceans have been enjoyed by humans from prehistoric
times forward. Cooking methods (boiling, grilling, steaming, deep frying, stir fry), recipes (cold mayonnaise salads, 
spicy cocktails, popcorn-style, cassererole sauce) and meal position (appetizer, sauce, main course, street food) vary through time and culture. 
Where did it all begin?
<p>
"Squilla" is the Latin word for shrimp. According to the food historians, both ancient Romans and
Greeks
had ready access to very large specimens and enjoyed their shrimp prepared many different ways.
Apicius,
an ancient Roman author, collected these recipes in his cookbook.
<p>
"Shrimp and prawn, group of small river and sea creatures. The larger species are easily cooked
and very
easily eaten...In Italy, if Marital is to be believed, the shrimp was at its best in the tidal reaches of
the River
Liris in southern Latium. This river reached the sea at Minturnae. Now it was at Minturnae,
according to
legend, that Apicius lived--eighty years before Marital's time--and enjoyed the local  magnificent
shrimps,
which grow bigger than the shrimps at Smyrna, bigger indeed than the lobsters at Alexandria' to
quote
Athnaeus...Pliny the Younger boasted of good shrimps a little further north, at his Laurentan villa.
Shrimps
danced when roasted on the coals, Ophelion tells us...The were served honey-glazed at the dinner
described by Philoxenus, and in general in ancient cuisine they were roasted, or fried in a skillet,
rather than
boiled."<br>
---<i>Food in the Ancient World from A to Z</i>, Andrew Dalby [Routledge:London] 2003 (p.
301)
<p>
"There have always been customers for shrimp ready to fall upon them whenever and wherever
they could
be delivered. In the ancient Mediterranean world, where fishing was on an artisanal scale and
almost
everybody lived close to the water, the Greeks preferred the larger types of shrimp even to
lobster, and
cooked them wrapped in fig leaves. The Romans made the finest grade of all their all-purpose
sauce,
liquamen, from shrimps. When Apicius heard that there were particularly large, luscious ones in
Libya, he
chartered a ship to sample them on the spot himself, but he was so much disappointed by the first
ones
brought to him aboard ship that he sailed home without ever setting food on shore."<br>

"The word shrimp derives from Middle English shrimpe, meaning "pygmy" or the crustacean
itself. Shrimp
harvesting was known as early as the seventeenth century in Louisiana, whos bayou inhabitants
used seine
nets up to two thousand feet in circumference. Only after 1917 did mechanized boats utilize trawl
nets to
catch shrimp."<br>

<a name="prawn">
<b> Shrimp vs. prawn?</b><br>
The difference between these two items appears to be contextual. There are biologic, semantic and legal definitions. General descriptions here:
<p>
" Shrimp...a term which always refers to certain crustceans...in the order of Decapoda Crustacia...but which, with the assocaited
term 'prawn', is used in different ways on the two sides of the Atlantic--and in other parts of the world, depending on whether
the use of the English language has been influenced by the British or by Americans. Since the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization
of the United Nations) has taken the trouble to produce a comprehensive <i>Catalogue of Shrimps and Prawns of the World</i> (Holthuis,
1980), they may be allowed to explain: 'we may say that in Great Britain the term 'shrimp' is the more general of the two, and is
the only term used for Crangonidae and most smaller species. 'Prawn' is the more special of the two names, being used solely for
Palaemonidae and larger forms, never for the very small ones. In North America the name 'prawn' is practically obsolete and is 
almost entirely replaced by the word 'shrimp' (used for even the largest species, which may be called 'jumbo shrimp'). If the
word 'prawn' is used at all in America it is attached to small pieces."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2nd edition, 2006 (p. 720)
<p>
"Prawn. A Crustacean in the order of Decapoda. Prawns differ in the appearance from shrimps in having more slender abdomens and 
longer leags but the names are used synonymously in commercial trade. Unfortunately, at market "prawn" is univerally applied to 
any off the larger marine shrimps. The less familiar term "freshwater prawn" refers to paleamonid shrimps, specifically 
Macrobrachium of which there are more than 100 species on a world basis. The giant Malaysian prawn (M. rosenbergii) is 
perhaps the bes known and is widely cultured in southern Asia as well as Hawaii and more recently in Puerto Rico. The
Tahitian prawn (M. lar) is also widely distributed in the western Pacific Islands, and other species are indigenous to India, the
Philippines, Africa, Central and South America. A large native from (M. acanthurus) is found in southern U.S. from the Neuse
River in North Carolina to Texas. However, freshwater prawns are only utilized on a local level by individual fishermen at present.
Stricly speaking, prawns are andromonous and not totally freshwater curstaceans, but they are harvested in rice fields, ponds and rivers....
Prawns are more perishable than marine shrimps and must be iced or flash frozen immediately after capture. Only the tail portion
is eaten. The always sweet meat is comparable to lobster in texture and flavor."<br>

<p>
"Prawn (Macrobrachium acanthurus). A Crustacean similar to a shrimp but with a more slender body and longer legs. The name is from
Middle Englsih prayne. At market the term prawn is often used to describe a wide variety of shrimp that are not prawns at all. The
only native American species is found in the South, ranging from North Carolina to Texas. Prawns are cultivated in Hawaii."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food& Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 255)
<p>
"The terms "shrimp" and "prawn" are used almost interchangeably. Americans primarily use the word "shrimp" for large and
small crustaceans in the Penaeidae and Pandalidae families. Elsewhere in the world "prawn" usually describes a smaller
creature."<br>

<p>
<b>First shrimp/prawn recipes?</b><br>
Presumably, prawns have been consumed from prehistoric times forward. Although written recipes did not exist in the earliest times, we can assume prawns were 
boiled (perhaps with seasoning) similar to lobsters and other crustaceans. It is possible tiger (jumbo) prawns were eaten by themselves or as protein part of soups and
 stews. 
The earliest print recipes (Apicius, Ancient Rome) confirm boiling and add mincing (combined with spices, fillers to achieve patties) as popular ways for preparing seafood.
<p>
These modernized recipes originally appeared in Apicus, Book II: Minces. They were served as starters or side dishes. The original [transliterated] text does not specifically state prawn 
or shrimp. Recipes specify sea-onion, crab, lobster, cuttle fish, ink fish, spiny lobster, scallops and oysters. Presumably prawns/shrimp could have been treated similarly. Book IX 
[Seafood] offers recipes for boiled lobster and minced lobster tail meat. These might have been "main" courses. 
<blockquote>
<b>Squill or Prawn Patties (Apicus 44) </b><br>
...Patties of squills or large prawns: The prawns or squills are removed from their shells and ground in a mortar with pepper and the finest garum. Patties are formed with the meat. <bre>
Serves 4 <br>
1 3/4 lb (800 g.) prawns, squills, or shrimp (shelled weight) <br>
1 Tbs. garum <br>
pepper to taste <br>
pork caul fat <br>
These seafood patty recipes are all fairly similar, differing mainly in the type of fish used. This recipe for squills or prawns (you can also use shrimp) is particularly delicate. Scald the 
crustaceans in boiling water so that the heads and shells can be easily removed. grind the meat in a mortar with the garum and pepper and form patties from this mixture. I suggest 
wrapping each of these in caul fat...so that the patties do not fall apart. The boil or fry in a bit of olive oil."<br>

<p>
<b>"Prawn Balls in gydorgarum, Apicius 2.1.1 </b><br>
The prawn balls are cooked in a special cooking sauce made with fish sauce and water known a hygrograum. A modern counterpart would be a 'court bouillon' designed for poaching. 
This hydrograum is flavoured simply with celery leaves and pepper. <br>
300 g raw king prawns <br>
2/3 tsp lovage seeds <br>
1 level tsp cumin <br>
pinch asafoetida resin or powder <br>
generous freshly ground black pepper <br>

1 coffee cup of fish sauce <br>
7 coffee cups of water <br>
a small handful of celerly leaves <br>
freshly ground black pepper. <br>
Peel and clean the intestinal tract from the prawns. Pound or process into a paste. Roast and grind the three spices, mix them with the pepper and add to the prawn paste with the egg 
and bread crumbs. Process until combined. In a small, deep frying-pan place 1 measure of fish sauce to 7 measures of water using a small coffee cup. To this add the green leaves from a 
head of celery. Bring to a simmer. Check the seasoning, adjust with more pepper if necessary. Using two large teaspoons, make egg shaped balls by scooping the mixture from one spoon 
to the other. Drop them in the simmering hydrogarum and gently cook until they have set (no more than 4-5 minutes). Serve warm with salad leaves dressed with an oenogarum."<br>

</blockquote>
<br>
If you are studying ancient prawns in a different culture (Maori?) or period (18th century?) your best bet is to examine period cooking 
techniques/vessels. Prawns might have been steamed, roasted, &c. In the absence of prawn references, substitute crab, lobster & scallop. Shrimp, 
of all sizes are generally treated in the same manner.

<a name="cocktail">
<font color="#003366"><b>Shrimp cocktail</b></font><br>
Although people have been combining fish with spicy sauces since ancient times, the "shrimp
cocktail," as
we Americans know it today, belongs to the late 19th/early 20th century. A survey of American
cookbooks
confirms the combination of shellfish (most typically oysters) and a spicy tomato-based sauce
(usually
ketchup spiced with horseradish, tabasco, and cayenne) served in tiny cups as appetizers was
extremely
popular in the early part of the 20th century. There are several variations on this recipe.
<p>
Oysters were original the "cocktail" shellfish of choice. Shrimp variations were popular in
Cajun/Creole cooking before they begin to show up in "mainstream" cookbooks. Presumably this
is because oysters were "wildly" popular with Americans during the late 19th century. Shrimp,
less so. Tabasco, a common ingredient, is also a product of Louisiana. Avery Island, to be exact.
<p>
Incidentally, "cocktail" appetizers (think fruit cocktail, shrimp cocktail) were extremly popular
during the 1920s, the decade of Prohibition. In the 1920s, these appetizers were actually served in
"cocktail glasses" originally meant to hold alcoholic beverages. It was a creative way to use the
stemware!

Savory Cocktails</b><br>
Savoury cocktails are usually made of raw fish, although combinations of raw and smoked fish are
sometimes used, and in rare instances good-sized bits of broiled mushrooms and sweetbreads are
used instead of the fish. These savoury cocktails should be properly served in cocktail glasses,
which are in turn imbedded in cracked ice-soup plates or the new glass oyster plates being used
for the service. If the cocktail is mixed with the sauce in the glass, a bit of parsley may top it, or
pieces green may be placed, wreath fashion, around the cocktails. If you do not posses cocktail
glasses, hollowed-out green peppers or tomatoes may be used, or the cocktail sauce with the
savoury ingredient may be thoroughly chilled and served in ordinary small cocktail glasses. In this
case the green is placed at the base.

<a name="scampi">
<font color="#003366"><b>Shrimp scampi</b></font>
<p>
Scampi has two meanings: the name of a shrimp (Italian word) and the name of the dish. Shrimp
scampi,
as we Americans know it today, became popular after World War II. This was when many Italian
dishes
went "mainstream." According to our sources, "scampi" is not one set recipe, but a generic name
applied to
several dishes variously composed of shrimp. Notes here:
<p>
"What is scampi?"...is asked frequently of this department, and a quick check disclosed that it is
also asked
of fishmongers and Italian restauranteurs. Although the answers received will probably vary with
every
source consulted, they do fall into two basic categories: a type of shrimp or a preparation of
shrimp.
Howevever, the ramifications within these two categories are bewildering. In an effort to get an
unromantic,
unbiased definition of the word; Italian dictionaries of all sizes were consulted. Unfortunately they
were
peculiarly silent on the subject...Italian cookbooks yielded more relevant, but scarcely more
helpful
information. Most offered recipes for "scampi" or "shrimp scampi style" and such recipes
generally (but not
always) called for jumbo shrimp, olive oil, garilc and parsley.
     "Preparation varies. The methods of cooking, however, varied from boiling to broiling and
from frying to
baking. Some called for shelling the shrimp in advance; others recommended serving the dish only
to
"people who are willing to remove the shells at table." Some called for marinating the shellfish in
advance;
others did not. One even introduced a bread crumb topping. All this would seem to point to the
fact that
scampi is not, after all, a particular method of preparing shrimp. Some cookbooks and most
persons
consulted agreed with this and generally (but, again, not always) deveined scampi as shellfish
native to the
Adriatic (notably the Bay of Venice) that are not available in this country. But the specifications
of the
shellfish varied from that of a small shrimp to that of a lobster tail and a flavor from similar to
Mexican
shrimp to unlike anything else. The most authoritative answer came from Mrs. Hedy
Giusti-Lanham, who
styled herself "practically a scampo--alothough not quite as pink as I should be--because the best
ones
come from Venice, where I am from."
   "Plump little beasts. "What are scampi?" she asked rhetorically..."The are like shrimps in this
country,
only smaller. The larger ones, like the jumbo here, are called scampi imperali; but the normal
scampi are
quite small. The are plump little beasts and are quite round when they sit on the plate, because the
tails
curl in close." "No one where I come from would put a heavy sauce on top, like in shrimp
cocktail." she
commented. "They are usually thrown into heavy boiling water, then deveined and shelled and
served
lukewarm. Or they may be broiled by basting the shells with oil and putting them under the broiled
or over
charcoal and basting them while they cook. The shells get very dark and crack when the inside is
done.
They are served with their shells on. You put a little olive oil and a little lemon on them as you
take them out
of the shells, and a little pepper--but no salt. Garlic? Oh, no, no, no. They have such flavor that
anything
else would be an insult." Asked whether there was a great difference between scampi and
American-style
shrimp, Mrs. Guisti-Lanhan replied: "They are a similar type of person but the accent is very
different."<br>

"In the latter part of the 20th century the Norway lobster became a standard item on British

tourists."<br>

"Scampi is the plural of the word scampo, 'shrimp', a word of unkown origin. It started to filter
into English in
the 1920s, but it was not really until the 1950s and 1960s that it began to make headway. This
coincided
with a boom in popularity of a dish consisting of large prawn tails coated in breadcrumbs and
deep-fried:
scampi and chips became a staple on cafe and restaurant menus. Soon scampi had well and truly
ousted
the native English Dublin Bay prawns."<br>

<font color="#003366"><b>Shrimp wiggle</b></font><br>


Food historians confirm savory quick-cooked combinations of protein, vegetables, sauces and spices have been consumed from ancient times forward. These dishes are economical, portable, flexible and creative. Recipes vary according to culture and cuisine. "Wiggle" recipes, combining minced canned pre-cooked protein (shrimp, salmon, lobster, chicken), white sauce, and peas are generally placed in late 19th-early 20th century United States. The dish's rise (& fall) is connected with the chafing dish, a "dainty" table-top cooking apparatus introduced in late Victorian times. 
Chafing dishes powered by canned combustibles (sterno, etc.) appealed to cooks for several reasons. (1) Ornate design entranced stylish hostesses serving the latest food trends. (2) Portability appealed to cooks without access to kitchens. (3) Adaptability empowered both finicky gourmets, economical cooks, & boarding students to easily create foods of their choice. 
Chafing dishes, like crock pots and casseroles, enjoy cyclical popularity. 
<p>
The first print <a href="foodlobster.html#farmerwiggle">
Shrimp Wiggle recipe</a> we have (so far) was published by Fannie Farmer in 1898. Ingredients and method confirm this is a
convenience dish. 
Our survey of historic USA newspapers uncovered references to the
 resurgence of "old-fashioned" chafing dish cookery in every decade from the 1920s forward. The connecting thread is the "wow" factor. What better way to 
combine simple (generally leftover or canned) ingredients yet impress your guests?

<b>About Shrimp Wiggle</b><p> 
"Shrimp Wiggle...Around the turn of the century college girls kept chafing dishes in their dormitory rooms and cooked on the sly. A favorite production was Shrimp 
Wiggle: canned peas and shrimp heated in a basic white sauce, then served on toast. If the girls were living dangerously, they might sneak in a little 'cooking sherry.' 
The dish remained a ladies' lunch staple well into this century with crisp patty shells replacing toast points."<br>

<p>
<b>Why call it "wiggle?"</b><br>
Our survey of food history books, cookbooks, and historic newspaper articles confirms many interesting notes regarding the genesis and cyclical popularity of this 
dish. It did not, however, shed light on the origin of the name. Food writers, if they acknowledge the name at all, gently state they do not know its origin. 
<p>
"Shrimp Wiggle. A dish of creamed shrimp especially popular in New England and the Midwest. The reason for the name is not known, though it may refer to the 
ease and quickness with which the dish is made."<br>---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food & Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 295) 
<p>
This gives us license to explore the possibilities presented by "educated guess." The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> (2nd edition, online edition) tells us the word 
"wiggle" acts as both verb and noun. The primary definition, in both cases, to lightly move in either a side to side or irregular motion. Such movement applies to the 
general cooking method for accomplishing Wiggle recipes in the chafing dish apparatus. Definitions here: <p>
VERB: "1. intr. To move to and fro or from side to side irregularly and lightly, to waggle; to walk with such a movement, to stagger, reel, also to waddle (now 
dial.); to go or move sinuously, to wriggle." <br>

them. Today they are child's play in comparison--all electrified. And they are beautiful things, too. Made of shining chromium plated wear, which resists tarnish and 
need no polishing to keep them bright and and attractive. Chafing dish suppers are lots of fun: gay, informal affairs, and it seems only right that they would be 
revived. Let us hope that their popularity will be long continued....Almost any sort of creamed dish may be successfully prepared in a chafing dish. Among my

"Every once in awhile someone asks us for a recipe for shrimp wiggle. When we told a friend we didn't know how the dish got its name, or where or whom, it 
originated, she hazarded a guess that it originally arrived witht he chafing dish. She siad her own acquaintence with shrimp wiggle went back to her college 
dormitory days in the 20's when she and her friends prepared it over canned heat with canned peas, canned shrimp and canned milk. Naturally they served it with 
crackers. Sure enough, in Fannie Farmer's 'Chafing Dish Possibilities' published in 1898, we find a recipe for shrimp wiggle composed of a thin white sauce and 
equal parts of cooked shrimp and green peas; salt and pepper are the only seasonings the austere Miss Farmer added. When that other old-time standard work, 
'The Settlement Cook Book' got around to listing the dish, paprika was included. Later recipes, we notice, sometimes include onion. Here's our own latest version 
of shrimp wigge--with a goodly amount of Worcestershire sauce and some Tobasco Sauce, as well as a canned pimiento, to give it extra heat. This recipe is a fine 
one for career girls and busy mothers becuase it should be left in the refrigerator overnight so the sauce will thin and the flavors develop. We like it served with crisp 
buttered toast and a crisp tossed slad. Make the toast as usual, then butter it lavishly and put it in the oven on aluminum foil to get really crisp and have the butter 
soak in. <p>

water to cover, drain; devein. Cut each shrimp in half length-wise. Drain peas thoroughly; add enough milk to the pea liquid to make 2 cups. Melt butter in 
medium-sized saucepan over low heat; sitr in flour. Add milk mixture, all at once; cook and stir constantly over moderately low heat, until bubbly and thickened. 
Stir in salt, Worcestershire sauce, Tobasco sauce (to taste) and minced pimiento. Add shrimp and drained peas. Cover and cool. Turn into container; cover lightly;

Archaeological evidence suggests oysters were consumed from the dawn of humanity forwards. Easy to collect, nourishing and tasty, these versatile molluscs were 
consumed raw, cooked, and preserved. Recipes varied according to place and taste. General notes here:
<p>
"The beginnings of mollusc culturing is lost in antiquity, and although it has been suggested by some that the Chinese were the first to cultivate oysters, it is to the 
Romans that we must look for good evidence. Indeed, there seems little doubt that their energies in cultivating both oysters and snails had an important bearing on the 
food interest of later peoples in these molluscs."<br>

"Oyster, bivalve shellfish which has been an article of food on Mediterranean coasts since prehistoric times. Heaps of oyster-shells were found by Heinrich Schliemann in 
his excavations at Mycenae. The classical Hellespont was rich in oysters, the city of Abydos in particular, according to Archestratus. Latin poets agree...The oysters of
 Britain, which must have been very new to Rome in Mucianus's time, came fro the Kent coast, as they do now...Oysters were a rich man's dish...and wealth was 
demonstrated by the consumption of large numbers of them...The fact that British oysters were available in Rome shows that they were preserved--presumably in brine, in
 barrels or earthenware jars--for dipatch on the long journey from the Channel coast."<br>

"Oyster-farming is only one branch of shell-fish farming in general, which covers the culture of all edible shellfish...From the dawn of time to the middle of the nineteenth 
century, the coasts of France had an almost uninterrupted succession of natural oyster beds; you had only to gather what you wanted. At the time of the Roman
 occupation they oyster culture was so well described by Ausonius in the fourth century had reached a degree of technical perfection almost the equal of today's. Then, 
with the barbarian invasions, both Atlantic and Mediterranean oyster farming ceased. Gastronomic history remains silent on the oyster for 1000 years, but the natural beds
 provided part of the everyday diet of coast-dwelling people. In large inland cities shellfish, difficulty and expensive to bring to market fresh, were the perrogative of the rich
 from the fourteenth century onwards. Pickled oysters were not to be despised, though...Whether as a result of thoughtless plundering of the beds (100 million oysters a 
year were gathered at Treguier and Cancale around 1775), or of a series of destructive storms around 1850 even diligent searching could produce only 83,000 dozen 
oysters. In 1852 Monsieur de Bon, the naval paymaster of Satint-Servan, had the idea of re-seeding the oyster beds in his sector by trying to collect the oyster spawn, or
 'spat', with makeshift catchers. He succeeded, and set up new oyster beds on the emerging reefs."<br>

<b>Oysters in America</b><p>
"In Britain, oysters have been eaten, and undoubtedly loved, since prehistoric times. There were a
particular favorite of the Romans. In fifteenth-century London, oysters were "plentiful, very
popular and on the whole inexpensive."...a sixteenth-century traveler to England said that the
oysters "which were cried in every street" were better than any he had seen in Italy. Oysters were
brined by seventeenth-century husbandmen, who bought them fresh to insure quality. The shells,
rich in lime, were used as fertilizer...As with other fish in medieval and early modern England,
oysters were often baked in heavily spiced pies, or stewed. Like other small fish, fresh oysters were
sometimes fried immediately to prevent spoilage...Despite being inexpensive, oysters were enjoyed
by all classes...Oyster-eating quickly became an American pastime...Oysters were served in
colonial taverns, along with the usual tavern fare of fowl, beefsteaks, ham, and hot bread...Oysters
only became more popular in the nineteenth century...Oyster houses, or saloons as they were often
called, specialized in quick, fresh oyster meals. Richard Pillsbury states that they "began appearing
in the late eighteenth century as some of the first freestanding restaurants in the nation." Advertised
with red and white balloon-shaped signs, they were popular in every coastal city, frequented by
lunchtime crowds of men. Some oyster saloons did set aside curtained booths or special rooms for
women and faminlies. Commercial oyster eateries were organized along class lines...Nineteeth-century New England cookbooks abounded with "escaloped" oysters, oyster sauce, oyster soup, pie,
and patties, stewed oysters, roasted oysters, and fried oysters. Nut oysters were also used in more
esoteric recipes. For instance, Mrs. Lee offered "Oyster Attlets," which was a sweetbread, cut into
small pieces, a slice or two of bacon, and oysters, seasoned with parsley, shallot, thyme, salt and
pepper, then skewered, covered with bread crumbs, and broiled or fried. Oysters also became a
condiments...Yankee tavern owners went to great lenghts to have supplies of oysters on hand
throughout the winter months. In late autumn they stocked their cellars with oysters...burying them
in beds of damp sea sand mixed with cornmeal. To theel their buried treasures alive, they watered
the beds twice a week. The mollusks would be dug out of the pile as needed. Oyster pies and patties
were favorite ways of serving cellar oysters, perhaps becuase oysters that ascended from the tavern
depths were not as fresh as those from the briny deep...At midcentury, oyster parties were the rage
among New England aristocracy, as they were in every sophistiscated metropolis...Like many
popular foods, oysters were also considered medicinal...Despite the low price of oysters, recipes for
mock oysters, made of salsify, the "vegetable oyster," as Lydia Maria Child called it, or of corn,
often seasoned with mace, appeared in cookbooks throughout the nineteenth century...The oyster's
association with New England, while never exclusive to the region, was strong enough to endur in
nostalgic cookbooks."<br>

"Oysters have long been considered a delicacy and have been cultivated for at least two thousand
years. The American Indans of the coastal regions enjoyed them as a staple part of their diet, and
the earliest European explorers marveled at oysters that were up to a foot in length. Cultivation
began soon afterward, and Virginia and Maryland have waged "oyster wars" over offshore beds
since 1632. Although the oyster may have been an expensive delicacy in Europe, it was a common
item on eveyone's table in America. Bt the eighteenth century the urban poor were sustained by
little more than bread and oysters. Coonia citizens dined regularly on chicken and oysters, and the
mollusk was an economical ingredient for stuffing fowl and other meats. By the middle of the next
century English traveler Charles Mackay could write in his book Life and Liberty in America
(1859) that "the rich consume oysters and Champagne; the poorer classes consume oysters and
large bier, and that is one of the principal social differences between the two sections of the
community." Americans were oyster mad in the nineteenth century, and as people moved and
settled westward, the demand for the bivalves in the interior regions grew accordingly. This
demand was met by shipping oysters by stagecoach on the "Oyster Line" from Baltimore to Ohio,
followed after the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 by canal boats laden with oysters. Canned or
pickled varieties were available as far west as St. Louis, Missouri, by 1856...Every coastal city had
its oyster vendors on the streets, and "oyster saloons," "cellars," or "houses" were part of urban
life...Throughout the middle of the century oysters remained plentiful. Even when other foodstuffs
were scarce in the Civil War, Union soldiers in Savannah sated their hunger with buckets full of
oysters brought to them by the slaves they had liberated...Nowhere was the oyster more appreciated
than in New Orleans, where several classic oyster recipes...were created...The demand for oysters
was so high that by the 1880s the eastern beds began to be depleted."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999
(p. 226-7)
<p>
"The changing role of that oysters played in American cuisine, from the wigwams of the
Wampanoags to the famous New York City oyster saloons and gradually to the dining rooms from
Boston to San Francisco, is a saga that progressed from sheer necessity to serendipity. The Indians
taught the colonists to harvest and cook oysters in a stew that staved off hunger, and in 1610 food
shortages in Jamestown, Virginia, led settlers to travel to the mouth of the James River, where
oysters sustained them. Two centuries later, a feature of the American diet became a between-meal
snack at a vendor's stand, and a dozen or two half shells became a prelude to a more substantial
oyster pie or, on the West Coast, an oyster omelet known as Hangtown fry. Another dish utilizeing
the mollusk was roasted fowl stuffed with oysters. By 1840, annual shipments of oysters from the
Chesapeake Bay to Philadelphia had reached four thousand tons. By 1859, residents in New York
City spent more on oysters than on butchers' meat. The oyster craze of the nineteenth century
spread across the country by stagecoach, by boat when the Erie Canal opened to barges, and by rail
when the railroads traveled westward. By the 1880s the demand for oysters was so great that the
beds that stretched along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts began to be depleted..."<br>

<font color="#003366"><b>Angels on horseback</b></font><br>
Angels on Horseback is a popular 19th-early 20th century appetizer composed of skewered broiled oysters wrapped in bacon.
Recipe synonyms include "oysters and bacon" and "pigs in blankets." Modern American readers think of 
<a href="foodmeats.html#pigblankets">pigs-in-blankets</a> as pastry wrapped mini sausages. 
An excellent lesson in how words, like recipes, change meaning over time.

<a href="foodlobster.html#devilhorse">Devils on Horseback</a>
is a later recipe, generally substituting stuffed prunes for oysters.
 
<p>
"The angels are oysters wrapped in rashers of bacon, cooked quickly under the grill, and riding on slivers of toast. The dish
is a British contribution to gastronomy, and it was popular as a hot savoury postlude to a meal in the later nineteenth
century and early part of the twentieth century. It seems first to have been mentioned in the 1888 edition of Mrs.
Beeton's <i>Book of Household Management</i>, which gives an alternate French name, anges a cheval. Now that oysters are
decidedly on the luxury list, angels on horseback are often encountered in more downmarket version as party
snacks, with cocktail sausages substituting for the shellfish."<br>

<font color="#003366"><b>Oysters Kirkpatrick</b></font><br>
Modern food historians generally agree the dish called "Oysters Kirkpatrick" was first served in San Francisco's Palace Hotel in the second decade of the twentieth 
century. Of course, most dishes are not invented. They descend from a long line of related items. Recipes combining broiled oysters and bacon were very popular in 
the late 19th and early twentieth centuries. They range from traditional fare (Angels on Horseback) to spicy selections (Devilled oysters). Oysters Kirkpatrick fall
 neatly between the two extremes. Notes & recipes here: 
<p>
"Oysters Kirkpatrick. New Orleans, with its Oysters Rockefeller, has nothing on us, with our Oysters Kirkpatrick. This dish was named in honor of John C. Kirkpatrick, onetime manager of the Palace, in San Francisco. It was, of course, conceived in their kitchen. Like all recipes of renown, this one has many versions--but who am I to quibble with the Palace Hotel's own recipe, graciously sent for inclusion in this book. 
"Open oysters on deep shell, put in oven for about 3 or 4 minutes until oysters shrink, Pour off the liquor, then add small strip of bacon and cover with catsup and place in a very hot oven for about 5 or 6 minutes (according to oven) until glazed to a nice golden brown."
Here's another way it's done, or am I quibbling? Allow pieplates or deep ovenproof plates, one for each serving, and fill them with rock salt within an inch of their tops. Put them into the oven to become very hot. The oysters, usually 6 to a serving, are opened and left in their deep shells, which are placed in little indentations made in the hot salt. On top of each oyster is spread a spoonful of tomato catsup whcih has been mixed with finely minced green pepper. On this goes a piece of partially cooked bacon, next some grated cheese, awith a small dab of butter as the finishing touch. The pans are returned to the oven (450 degrees F.) until the cheese is nicely browned.
NOTE: Apparently this entire--and very good-business of roasting oysters in a pan of salt was originally just that--an oyster salt roast. But chefs were bound to 
add their distinctive touches, it's the artist in them. One was called "Oysters a la Mali," and was a bit more elaborate than most. A sauce made with 1/4 cup of 
cooked chopped spinach, a tablespoon of minced parsley, a tablespoon of minced tarragon, a clove of garlic, 1/4 cup of butter, a teaspoon of salt, and a cup of
 white wine, was mixed with 12 ground and drained poached oysters. This mixture was spread on the oysters in their shells (see above). They were then sprinkled 
with buttered crumbs and baked until brown."<br>
---<i>West Coast Cook Book</i>, Helen Brown, 1952 facsimile reprint [Cookbook Collectors Library] (p. 148-9) 
<p>
"Oysters Kirkpatrick. A dish of baked oysters, green pepper, and bacon. The creation of this dish is credited to chef  Ernest Arbogast of the Palm Court (later the 
Garden Court) of San Francisco's Palace Hotel. named after Colonel John C. Kirkpatrick, who managed the hotel from 1894 to 1914, the dish was already well
 known by the end of his tenure, when Clarence E. Edwards wrote in Bohemian San Francisco (1914) that the dish was merely a variation on the "oyster salt roast" 
served at Mannings' Restaurant on the corner of Pine and Webb streets."<br>
---<i>The Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 228)<br>

A1 sauce, 1 t. chopped parsley, and half a small chopped green pepper. Cut bacon slices into thirds, and cook halfway. Shuck oysters, dip them into sauce, and place them in shells. Place oysters on a bed of rock salt, cover with bacon, and sprinkle on Parmesean cheese. Bake at 400 degress F. until bacon is crisp."]

each. Bake in the oven until the edges of the oysters curl."<br>

<font color="#003366"><b>Oysters Rockefeller</b></font><br>
Oysters figure prominently in traditional New Orleans cuisine. They are featured in a variety of
recipes. Oysters Rockefeller is attributed to Jules Alciatore of <a href="http://www.antoines.com/history.html">Antoine's</a>. Notes here: 
<p>
"Oysters Rockefeller. A dish of oysters cooked with watercress, scallions, celery, anise and other
seasonings. It is a specialty created in 1899 by Jules Alciatore of Antoine's Restaurant in New
Orleans...The original recipe for oysters Rockefeller has never been revealed...There does appear a
recipe, however, in a 1941 compilation by Ford Naylor called the <i>World Famous Chefs' Cook
Book</i>, in which the author contends, "Every recipe in this book, with few exceptions, is a secret
recipe which has been jealously guarded..." The recipe for "Oysters a la Rockefeller" is given above
the name "Antoine's Restaurant, New Orleans"..."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999
(p. 228) 
<p>
"Oysters Rockefeller was created in 1899 by my great-grandfather Jules Alciatore. At that time there
was a shortage of snails coming from Europe to the United States and Jules was looking for a
replacement. He wanted this replacement to be local in order to avoid any difficulty in procuring the
product. He chose oysters. Jules was a pioneer in the art of cooked oysters, as they were rarely
cooked before this time. He created a sauce with available green vegetable products, producing a
richness that he named it after one of the wealthiest men in the United States, John D. Rockefeller. I
have estimated that we have served over three million, five hundred thousand orders--quite a large
number, considering that they have all been served in a single gourmet restaurant. The original
recipe is still a secret that I will not indulge. As many times as I have seen recipes printed in books
and articles, I can honestly say that I have never found the original outside of Antoine's."<br>
---<i>Antoine's Restaurant Since 1840 Cookbook</i>, Roy F. Guste, Jr. [Norton:New York] 1980 (p. 32) 
<p>
Why the name? In Alciatore's own words: "Oysters Rockefeller was one of his most famous dishes, named, he told his patrons, 'because I know no
other name rich enough for their richness.'"---Jules Alciatore, obituary, Associated Press, <i>New York Times</i>, 
September 13, 1934 (p. 23)
<p>
<b>Might this be the "secret" recipe?</b>
<blockquote>
"To dine at Antoine's is, after all, to learn by contrast that you would rather have simpler things, but that a name means a
great deal when it comes to foods...We had had oysters Rockefeller elsewhere, but the ony recipes we brought away with us were the
one for this and one for the soup we had. These were the only ones printed on the great sheet, giving a history of the house,
which we received as a souvenier. The last section of this begins: 'Monsieur Jules has invented many dishes which have added to the 
name of his house, chief among them being huites en coquille a la Rockefeller. Rockefeller's name sugests the golden flavor, that's
why it was added to the huitres, which is French for oysters....Jules is extremely reluctant about giving away the secrets of
his kitchen, but after some coaxing he was induced to part with the following while slowly sipping his cognac after 
luncheron.
<p>
<b>"Huitres en Coquille a la Rockefeller</b>--Raw oysters whtih a dressing made as follows, the quantity of the ingredients to 
depend upon the size of the order. One bunch of shallots, one bunch of parsley, two pounds of butter, one bottle of Spanish walnuts, half
a bunch of tarragon leaves, two stale loaves of French bread, salt and pepper, and a liberal sprinkling of tabasco sauce. All of 
these things are pounded into a pulp in a mortar, and then ground in a sausage machine, the mass being finally passed through a 
needle sifter. The oysters on the half shell are covered with the sauce and then placed in a hot oven to bake just three minutes.
The oysters must be served at once."<br>

<a name="scallops">
<font color="#003366"><b>Scallops</b></font><br>
Archaelogical evidence suggests people have been eating <a href="foodlobster.html#mollusks">mollusks</a> since the dawn
of human time. Scallops belong to this edible family. Food historians confirm ancient Romans enjoyed these delicious morsels.
By the 17th century, one of the more popular methods for serving this particular bivlave mollusk was to slice it up, mix it with
a sauce, add some bread crumbs and bake it in its shell. Other foods readily adapted to this method and were similary 
prepared.
<p>
Tracing the evolution of scallop cookery is challenging because the word is used in several contexts with different spellings.
Dishes titled scallop, scollop, collop, and escalope can be referring to the mollusk. They can also be describing a method for preparing any kind of minced meat
baked in cream sauce, sometimes presented in a scallop shell. Recipes reflect local place and taste. Indeed,  definitions of
<a href="foodlobster.html#scalloped">scalloped dishes</a> are all over the culinary map. 
<p>
<b>What is a scallop?</b><br>
"Scallop, an edible mollusk which exists in many species around the world and is highly esteemed in almost all regions, 
although not in Southeast Asia...Scallops do not crawl or burrow, so do not have a large 'foot'. Instead, they have a 
highly developed adductor muscle, by means of which they can open and close their shells and so propel themselves through 
the water. The Japanese name for scallop means, literally, 'full-sail fish'. from the manner of its movement with one 
shell raised. Not all scallops exercise this ability. Some remain anchored by a byssus to some solid object..." <br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.703-704) 
<p>
<b>Ancient world culinary applications</b><br>
"Scallop, a group of bivalve shellfish. They are among the best of shellfish gastronomically; their flavour is finest in
 spring when they spawn, as observed by Aristotle, These were cooked as a separate dish; 'grilled and served with vinegar 
and silphium they tend to loosen the bowels owing to their excessive sweetness; they are juicier and easier to digest is 
they are bake,' according to Xenocrates. They were also used as an ingredient, for example, in the souffle-like dish 
spumeum for this Anthimus gives a recipe. Scallops...belong to the family Pectinidae. Several species are common in the 
Mediterranean, and Xenocrates goes into some detail on their qualities. Other ancient authors focus on two kinds, each of 
which was at its best in a specified locality." <br>

<b>English food notes</b><br>
"Scallops. The scallop is a shell-fish somewhat larger than an oyster, and somewhat resembling it in shape. It is somethign like a crab
in taste. It may be served in two or three ways, and is generally highly esteemed where it is known. The scallop may enter appropriately
into any fish pie, though it should be boiled previously. It is best when scalloped. The deep shells of the scallop should be carefully
 preserved after they are used, and will be used when it is wished to 'scallop' the remains of dressed fish of any kind."<br>
---<i>Cassell's Dictionary of Cookery with Numerous Illustrations</i> [Cassell, Petter, Galpin & Co.:London]  1875 (p. 841)
<p>
"Scallop. This is a fish somewhat similar to an oyster in shape, but larger; it tastes rather like a crab. It may be served in 
various ways, and may enter into the composition of fish pies. The deep shells should be preeserved, as they are useful for sending
'scalloped fish' to table; any kind may be prepared and served in them. We would add that scallops, when not in good conditino, are
most objectionable in flavour, and also very unwholesome. Cost, about a penny each."<br>

"Scallop...The most familiar species in British waters if the great scallop...which has radially ribbed shells with an undulated edge the top shell being
cruved and the bottom one flat. It is commonly found on the coasts of the English Channel and the Atlantic. There are also several other
varieties, form the small bay scallop to the larger deepwater scallop...There are many ways of cooking them. They can be fried in batter
 or baked in white wine, sauce mornay, or sauce creme, but the simpler methods are best for preserving the delicacy of the flesh. They are
particularly good poached in a little sherry and water, then drained (the liquid being reserved) and turned in butter; 
then the stock and the butter are poured over and drecuded over a hot flame, and the scallops are seared in the sauce. Scallopes served ina sauce
mornay have come to be known in English-sepaking countries as coquilles-St.-Jascuqes, which in France is simply the common general 
name for all scallops. The deeper, rounded scallop shells, well scrubbed, may sometimes be used as a container for the scallop
dish, which can then be cooked in the shell and served from it, if it is large enough. In the U.S. scallops are smaller than thouse found off
British coasts; they also have no coral but only a small bluish-white roe, and they do not have as good a flavour."<br>

flouirs south of Cape Cod in areas with abundant eelgrass, on which the larvae settle temporarily...The scallop was a relative latecomer
to the market. Although Catharine Beecher mentions scallops in 1846, they did not regularly appear in New England cookbooks until the
1870s...Connecticut oystermen first tapped the scallop resources of Long Island's Peconic Bay in the 1850s, eventually creating a 
demand in New York for this fall delicacy. By the time scalloping was recognized as a distinct fishery of the 1880s, commercial scallopers
generally employed openers--often women--to pick out the meats and pack them for market. Yet this fishery did not take off until the 1920s
and 1930s, when sea scallops were discovered on Georges Bank and improvements in transportation and marketing made it possible to get both bay
and sea scallops to more people, in the coast and inland."<br>

"The seas is full of both fearful and beautiful things--but none lovelier than the fluted shellfish, the scallop. The scallop is also, I believe,
a misrepresented fish. The scallop is of two kinds, the large deep-sea scallop and the lesser size bay or cape kind, found in the the general
North Atlantic waters, includise of some water off Long Isalnd. Long Island Bay Scallops are a preferred item. Most of us think a scallop
 looks lke what we see for sale, but waht we see is onlyt the abductor muschole which holds this mollusk's shells together. There are 
gourments who like the body part of the scallop. At Tome Moore's restaurant in Bermuda, and a t certain European places, it is served as
a delicacy. But the muscle of the scallop is itself surely good eating--even raw (which is not usually known)."<br>

"Scallops, like oysters and clams, are mollusks. The single large muscle that opens and closes the shell is the edible portion. The most
popular fresh scallops are Bay Scallops which are small, pinkish white 3/4" cubes coming from bays. These are sold only during the
oyster season. The large scallops, known as Sea Scallops are cubes of 2" or more, which come from the sea and are not quite so finely flavored
as the bay scallops. They are in season the year round. In using these sea scallops, they may be split across the grain to a 
thickness of about 3/4". Packaged quick-frozen bay scallops may be purchased all year round in many parts of the country."

"The choicest scallops to be had are the small bay scallops, about 1/2 inch thick and a pinkish white. They are in season from early fall until
late spring. The larger, or deeo-sea, scallops are in season the year round. Scallops may be either sauteed in butter, dipped in fritter
batter and fried in deep hot fat (380 degrees F.), or dipped in melted butter and broiled very quickly. They are often served with crisp
bacon or in combination with other seafood dishes. Tiny bay scallops, served raw with a cocktail sauce, will be found very
palatable."<br>

<b>What does it mean when a dish is "scalloped?"</b><br>
"Scallop," as verb, refers to the method introduced by the French for serving finely minced
protein mixed in cream sauce, topped with breadcrumbs then baked in an oven. Presumably, the practice descends from
ancient minced dishes. Scalloped dishes may be served as hors d'oeuvres or side dishes. <a href="foodfaq1.html#gratin">"Au
Gratin"</a> dishes are related.
<p>
Fish, oysters, chicken, vegetables, and 
even <a href="foodlobster.html#scallops">scallops</a> can be scalloped. 
Some recipes are actually baked in real scallop shells purposely saved or purchased for "authentic" presentation. The use of
real scallop shells ("en coquilles") varies according popular culinary trends, cycling between economical to artful to vulgar and back again.
Silver dishes shaped like scallop shells were highly prized in the 19th century. Most scalloped dishes are simply baked en 
casserole. What's the difference between scalloped dish and casserole? The latter, at least on modern American tables,
generally includes a grain starch (rice or pasta). 
<p>
Linguists confirm <a href="foodlobster.html#escalope">escalopes, scallopini and collops</a> also descend from this etymological line. 
These terms, however, have very different meanings. They refer to a thin, breaded sauteed fillet of "white" meat, typically 
veal, chicken or other fowl. Think: <a href="foodmeats.html#wienerschnitzel">Wiener schnitzel</a> & <a href="foodmeats.html#countryfriedsteak">country fried steak</a>.

"Scalloped. A culinary term originally used to describe creamed dishes cooked in a scallop shell. In the U.S., however, it is now used particularly
to describe sliced vegetables, fish, poultry, fruit, etc., cooked in a sauce or liquid in the oven and served from the dish in which they
are cooked. Scaloppe, Italian for large ecalopes (scallops) of veal...Scaloppine, and alternative name for piccate or small

"Scalloped dishes are generally those made with a cream base such as scalloped oysters, scalloped

dishes, after they are assembled--frequently in layers--and dotted with butter, are baked until
bubbling hot and golden brown. The term "scalloped" presumably came about because such foods
were served in scallop shells."<br>

Our survey of historic recipes confirms the word "scallop" (aka scollop) meant different things at different times. Context
clues are key, because recipes often assume the reader/cook understands what is meant. In the selected recipes below,
the term scollop/scallop can refer to the mollusk, a fillet of boneless fowl, and baking creamed minced fish in a scallop 
shell. Vegetable scallops first surface in the early 19th century. Most popular versions are potatoes, corn, tomatoes and spinach.

<a name="escabeche">
<font color="#003366"><b>Escabeche</b></font><br>
Escabeche presents several challenges for food historians based on linguistic, culinary, and social factors. Variant spellings
through time and place require researchers to examine method and meal placement to determine the exact recipe. Generally,
Escabeche is fried fish that is treated with acids (vinegar, citrus) to achieve a stable preserving pickle. The recipe
orginated in the hot Mediterranean region, where it was a practical solution for fish preservation. <a href="foodlobster.html#ceviche">
Ceviche</a>, a raw fish pickled in similar ingredients descends from the same linguistic root but the recipe may not.

<b>What is escabeche?</b><br>
"Escabeche, a preparation for fried fish which has been allowed to cool and is then soused with a hot marinade of vinegar and other ingredients. The dish may be served hot, but it is 
more commonly kept and served cold. Indeed, the technique may well have originated as a means of preserving fish. The term occurs not only in its Spanish form, as here, but also in 
French (escabeche), Italian (scapece), Algerian (scabetch), and so on; and it appears in 17th- and 18-century English cookery books as 'caveach', a word which could be either a noun 
or a verb. Barbara Santich...gives a good account of the probably etymology of the term (from the Persian/Arabic sikbaj, meaning 'vinegar stew', vulgarized into iskebey) andof the 
medieval ancestors of the dish. One of the earliest mentions in Europe is in the Catalan treatise Sent Sovi (14th century), where there are several recipes for scabeig, escabeyg, and 
esquabey. The simplest of these calls for a midly vinegary and spicy sauce, thickened with toasted bread, onion, etc.; but other require nuts and raisins and fall into the category of
 sweet and sour. Santich points out that they correspond closely to some medieval English dishes with names like egurdouce (aigre-douce, sweet-and-sour). Indeed escabeche can be
 found, in past centuries and now, lurking under other names in various countries and context. In Italy there are many regional variants of the name scapece, but perhaps the most 
famous of all Italian versions of the dish, the Venetian Pesc in saor, is under a quite different name. Escabeche has migrated, under the same name, to the Philippines...where...'it is
 always fish, fried first. When it is taken out of the pan, vinegar, onions, ginger and garlic...'what has happened in Europe is that the escabeche has lost its medieval sweet-and-sour 
aspect, shedding the sweet ingredients such as sugar, raisins, dates, and becoming more 'streamlined.'..The essay by Santich ends with a suggestion that the term ceviche may be 
derived from escabeche. Certainly, if it could be established that the two terms are directly and closely related, and not just coincidental lookalikes, this whole subject area should be
 greatly clarified."<br>

"Contemporary escabeche consists of meat or fish fried in olive oil and them put into a marinade of vinegar or sour citrus juice for preservation and flavor. Ruperto de Nola
[<i>Libro de Cozina</i>, 1529] mentions this form of escbeche but he also give a another variety, where the object to be preserved, in his case fish, was boiled and then cooled and covered with a sauce of bread 
soaked in vinegar, ground with nuts and raisins, spiced, and cooked. Ruperto de Nola comments that it eats beter cold, but is not bad hot."<br>

"Caveach--Name and dish come from the Arabs (iskebey, to pickle with vinegar, according to Cormomnas (by way of Spanish escabeche. OED [<i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>] assigns a West Indain origina to

flour and frying in olive oil before pickling, had long been known in England. A highly detailed recipe, To Pickle mackrell, Flounders, Soles, or Sprats, appears in <i>Martha Washington's Booke of

Way of preserving Salmon, and all Sorts of Fish</a>, also a true escabeche; it is possible that Jews fleeing the Inquisition had brought the recipe from Spain to England. But the dish had long before penetrated 
France, showing up as espinbeche de rougets in <i>Le Menagier de Paris</i> (about 1393); name and dish persist in regional cookery to this day, demonstrating once agin the difficulties of pinning down

After that take round onions that are four fingers thick and slice them thin, and fry them with oil that is scarcely boiling. Then, when the onion is fried, when it crunches a bit, put it in with the 
sauce when it boils, and some of the oil from frying, so it is not too noticeable; and flavor it with sweetening, verjuice, salt and spices. You can put in raisins ground with wine or vinegar, and put it on 
top of the hot fried fish. It should be cooled before it is served. I have seen that with the seasonings, they ground toasted almonds and hazelnuts and toasted bread soaked in vinegar, and that they
mixed it with wine and vinegar."<br>

cebiche (fish stew)...Escabeche...is something different but comparable...When fish is cooked by heat, the main effect in terms of food chemistry is that its protein is 'denatured'. The 
citric acid in lemons or limes has a similar effect, although this is not called 'cooking'. At the time of writing, ceviche is experienceing a wave of popularity in North American restaurants
 with many variations being worked on the original. The Japanese-Peruvian community has also developled a dish called tiradito (from the Spanish tirar, to throw)...The same technique

food. It has different names in different parts of Spain: chocos in Galicia, jibiones in Santander, chiripua in San Sebastian, and calamares in Castile;
likewise calamari in Italy. In England it is also called sleevefish and inkfish or penfish because of the black liquid that it
squirts out at enemies, and which is used in the sauce with herbs and garlic. Cuttlefish is related and is served in the same way. The
ink is used in painting, as sepia. The calamary is known as tantonnet in Provence, where it is fried in oil with garlic. Other French
names are calmar, encornet, and seiche."<br>

<b>Octopus</b><br>
"Octopus, a genus of edible marine cephalopod mollusc with eight suckered arms. it is found in the more temperate coastal waters of the
Atlantic, and in the Mediterranean, where it is eaten a great deal. It is related to the squid and the cuttlefish. After being beaten for
some time, the tentacles or arms are cut in pieces, coated with flour and egg, and fried in hot oil. In Marseilles the pouch is washed
and sutffed with a mixture of onions, the finely chopped tentacles, garlic, parsley, and egg yolks; then it is simmered until tender in a
mixture of half oilive oil and half white wine. In Brittany it is known as minard and pieuvre."<br>

<b>How was squid cooked in the early days?</b><br>
<blockquote>
<b>[Ancient Greece]<br>
"Squid,</b> marine cephalopod, good to eat whatever its size. Little ones could be fried, and could be
part of a mixed fry-up or hepsetos, as Dorion says. Philoxenus writes with enthusiasm of a dish of
epipastai teuthides, squid with something--perhaps breadcrumbs--sprinkled over. A character in a
play by Sotades talks of teuthis onthyleumene, a stuffed squid, and a cook in Alexis explains in more
detail  As for the squids, I put up their fins, mix in a little fat, sprinkled a few fresh herbs and stuffed
them.' They were to be found a Dium, the Macedonian ceremonial centre, and also at ambracia in
northwestern Greece, according to Archestratus; but indeed they are widespread in the
Mediterranean. The general Greek term for squid is teuthis; the Latin equivalent is loligo, lolligo."<br>

"The satisfying small-fry and squid that are so simply cooked in olive oil are a ubiquitous preparation
in Greece and most of the coastal Mediterranean. Fry, meaning "young fish," derives from the Old
Norse, while fry, "to cook," derives from the Sanskrit through the Greek and Latin. Interestingly,
Greek food writers, while claiming all kinds of false provenance for other foods, neglect to mention
that kalamarakia tiganita and marides tiganita do indeed have a classical history. The first mention
I am familiar with for fried squid is found in Aristophenes' (455-388BC) lay The Acharnians, where
there is the tortuous image of a dish of sizzling squid being pulled away from the hungry Choregus.
We also know from Atheneus that fried squid, although not as common as boiled squid, was eaten."<br>

wine, thus squeezing out the squid's ink with these things, which is used to make its sauce, take an ounce of toasted almonds that have been
toasted in hot ashes, crush a bit of toasted bread--or omit, if you prefer--and crush these things together. Thin all these things with the

Tuna hot dogs? Certainly! Aka Tunies, Sea Dogs, Tuna Franks, Ham of the Sea. This 20th century novelty meat hasn't quite caught on, but not for lack
of trying. Target market appears to be thrifty households and observant Catholics. The earliest
mention we find in an American source is this brief note published in the New York Times circa
1949:
<p>
"The American hot dog is going to sea. A Gloucester firm said today a fish-filled version of the
hot dog will soon be on the market. Tuna fish will be the basic ingredient. The company lists
these proposed names: "Sea dogs," "fish dogs," "Friday Franks" and "tuna maid frankfurters.""<br>

<p>
"'Friday Franks', a tuna fish hot dog claimed by its sponsors to look and taste like the conventional beef and pork frankfurter--
will hit the retail food market today. "Friday Franks" are composed of 100% tuna meat with a small amount of vegetable oil and spices
for flavoring. No filler is added. The franks can be eaten either hot or cold. The tuna now being used is caught in New England
waters. First National Stores has obtained exclusive distribution rights for the first two weeks in its more than 1,000 outlets in 
New England and eastern New York. A 12-ounce can of "Friday Franks" trade name for the product contains about nine tuna frankfuters and retal for
59 cents. Davis Bros. Fisheries Co. Inc of this city [Gloucester Mass] is currently producing and canning around 500,000 sea dogs a day. John F. O'Hara, president of
Davis Bros. said that with consumption of regular hot dogs running between two million and five million pounds daily but tropping to 500,000
pounds on Friday, the need for a meatless variety was apparent, he asserted. The idea for a sea dog originated with two
Bostonians, Robert A. Poling, a spice expert and Pasquale Fraticelli, and attorney. Davis Bros., acquired the rights to the product
and further developed the process of spicing and smoking the tuna meat."<br>

almost every Friday night. There were five children in our house and four adults. They

Print references to tuna franks exist through the 1960s, then stray from the radar. Tuna franks
resurface (again, as *new*) in the late 1980s. "Bounty of the Sea" and "Ham of the Sea" were
catchy names but not enough to hook the American palate. Notes here:
<p>
<b>BOUNTY OF THE SEA</b><br>
"Houstonian Jerry Grisaffi has hooked a publicly traded shell company that he plans to use to flip
his local tuna hot dog company onto the Over-The-Counter exchange. Grisaffi's privately held
Bounty of the Sea expects to complete the acquisition of publicly traded Falcon Investment Co.
before the end of this month. Falcon is a Delaware corporation without ongoing operations,
whose stock trades in the pink sheets. Bounty of the Sea will be the surviving name of the
combined companies, and Grisaffi hopes to list his stock under the symbol BOTS or, possibly,
TUNA. As soon as the acquisition is completed, Bounty of the Sea will conduct a public offering
of 2 million new shares through which Grisaffi hopes to raise $ 3.5 million...Bounty of the Sea
was formed in late 1987 to manufacture and sell a line of hot dogs and assorted cold cuts made
from tuna fish. Grisaffi got the idea for the product on a Caribbean fishing trip when a local cook
served him fish that had been spiced and reshaped to look like ham. Nutritionally, tuna franks
contain twice the protein, half the calories and 70 percent less fat than hot dogs made from beef
or pork. The company also sells a tuna luncheon loaf and a tuna bologna and plans to debut a line
of tuna breakfast sausage in June. Grisaffi plans to market his tuna meats to the public through
retail grocers and to the institutional health market through major food brokers. His tuna franks
have been available in selected Houston grocery stores since the end of 1988, but the company's
products were only picked up last month by two major suppliers to the institutional food trade."<br>

"Tuna hot dogs just didn't float. Bounty of the Sea, a publicly traded company based in Sugar
Land, claimed it had the potential of luring health-conscious consumers into spending $ 25
million a year on hot dogs and lunch meats made from -- of all things -- tuna fish. Jerry Grisaffi,
a
former manager of a Houston car dealership, says he trolled venture capital sources for $ 1.2
million in start-up money. Supermarkets in Texas started selling the smelly food stuff in late
1988. And an over-the-counter offering later surfaced on the pink sheets pricing the company at $
1.75 a share. But neither the company nor its products caught on. Consumers turned their noses
up at tuna wieners. And, by and large, investors didn't bite at Bounty's stock. Now the company's
odd
selection of tuna dogs and tuna bologna is gone from the supermarket shelves. Although the
company's president says he wants to avoid bankruptcy, correspondence filed with court
documents indicate the tuna business has considered filing for Chapter 7 liquidation. And
shareholders are squabbling in court."<br>

<p>
<b>HAM OF THE SEA</b><br>
"For years, canned tuna, frozen fish sticks and pickled herring constituted the bulk of processed
seafood products available to consumers. Today, more imaginative offerings are being introduced
by both domestic and international firms eager to capitalize on the public's heightened interest in
fish. Many such new and unusual items debuted at Sea Fare '88, a recently concluded trade show
at the Long Beach Convention Center. The latest entries ranged from exotic tropical fish species
to the next generation of surimi, the highly processed seafood analog used primarily for imitation
crab. Certainly, the most ingenious new brand name to surface was Ham of the Sea. At present,
the line consists of tuna frankfurters and a ham-like luncheon meat made entirely from fish. The
frankfurters are a blend of the yellow fin and skipjack tuna varieties while the deli-style meat is
made from mahi-mahi. The products, manufactured in Costa Rica, are both low in calories,
sodium and fat. Jerry Grisaffi, Ham of the Sea president, said he just came up with the
catchy title without so much as mentioning that somewhat similar-sounding brand of canned
tuna. Response to Ham of the Sea, he said, was extremely positive. And to prove the point,
Grisaffi claims the U.S. Navy has agreed to become one of his first customers. The rest of the
country can expect to see Ham of the Sea by April."<br>

"The consumption of frogs is not, as is very often supposed, confined to the French. It is also indulged in, to a considerable extenty, 
by Americans; frogs appear to command a high prices in the New York market. An enthusiastic writer tries to convince us, that the only
objection to frogs as an article of diet is the mere prejudice on the part of those who have never eaten them. 'In what respect are they
worse than eels?'...The <i>Athenoeum</i>...recently came out in favour of frogs. 'There is no reason,' it remarks, 'why we should
eschew frogs and relish turtle.'...The green or edible frog...is a native or Europe, some parts of Asia, and also of Northern
Africa. It is in high request on the Continent for its flsh, the meat of the hind quarters, which is alone used, being delicate
and well tasted. In Vienna, where the consumption of these frogs is very considerable, they are preserved alive, and fattened in 
froggeries...constructed for the express purpose. In America, the flesh of the huge bull-frog...is tender, white, and affords
excellent eating. Some bull-frogs weigh as much as half-a-pound, but the hind legs are the only parts used as food. They make excellent

considerably reduced its [green frog] numbers, but it can still be found in the Dombes (hence its fame in
Lyonnais gastornomy), in Auvergne, Cologne, Brittany and Alsace...Most of the frogs eaten in France are
imported from central Europe and Yugoslavia. They tend to be larger and have more meat than local
species...The delicate flavor of the meat is enhanced by seasoning, and frogs' legs are often prepared
with herbs, garlic and chopped parsley. The are also made into blanquettes, soups, omelettes and
mousselines, and can be fried or sauteed. The most highly regarded recipes come from Lyons, Alsace
and Poitour. The Menangier de Paris contained recipes for cooking them in soups and in pies. Frogs' legs

Food historians confirm sardines have been consumed for thousands of years. Members of the herring family, sardines take their name from the tiny island country 
of Sardinia, in the Mediterranean. Sardine cuisine is traditionally popular throughout this region. <a href="foodlobster.html#pilchards">Pilchards</a> are sometimes called
"Cornish Sardines."
<p>
"In commerce "sardine" is not the name of any one fish but rather a collective term for a number of small soft-boned species in the herring family...The cannning
 industry began on the island of Sardinia with a Mediterranean species Sardina pilchardus, thus the name had historical acceptance. However, there are some 
difference in texture and flavor between the various fishes and often extreme variations in the quality of the pack...Large fresh sardines may be split and cooked 
over charcoal while butter basting, then served with generous splashes of lemon juice. In the Sicilian style they are baked in white wine, Sarde al Bino Bianco, or
 baked with a stuffing made from bread crumbs, anchovies, pine nuts, white raisins, onions and parsley in making a Sarde a Beccafico."<br>

"Sardine. A small, delicately flavored, salt-water fish. It is found everywhere, but especially off the shores of Brittany, where the sardine fisheries are a source of 
wealth for the inhabitants. It is said that in the eighteenth century they already produced an immense revenue, and in the city of Port-Louis alone, four thousand 
barrels were put up each year. Sardines are abundant in the Mediterranean, especially around Sardinia, form whihc they derive their name. Only inhabitants of the 
coast can eat fresh sardines, and even so the sardines must be salted as they are taken from the water, for of all fish these keep the shortest time. Sardines are
 prepared by salting and smoking. Those from the North are the most highly esteemed because aromatic herbs and spices are added to their brine, giving them a 
very pleasant flavor. But these sardines do not keep very long. When they have spoiled, they are used as bait for mackerel and other sea fish. Pisanelli claims that 
sardines love the sound of musical instruments, and will stick their heads out of the water to listen. Drinkers especialy fond of saridens, which stimulate their thirst

Pilchards (aka Cornish sardines & Gypsy herring) are native to Cornwall and Devon England. They figure prominently in the local
fishing industry and cuisine. <a href="christmasfood.html#stargazypie">Stargazey Pie</a>, featuring local pilchards, is a 
Christmas dish from the old days.
<p>
"Pilchard (Sardina pilcsarsdus), a fish of the herring family. Its name in England of the 16th century was 'pylcher' or 'pilchar,' the origin 
of which is unknown. Sardine is simply another name for a young pilchard; the sardines that are tinned in France and Portugal are immature fish of the same stock as the pilchards 
taken off the coast of Cornwall. Pilchards are also called 'gypsy herring.' Because of their high fat content they travel 
very badly, which is why, like sardines, they are only to be bought fresh in the neighbourhood of the ports at which they are 
landed. The shoals appear without warning and only briefly, and often almost the whole catch is tinned. However, in Cornwall it is 
possible to buy them fresh after a catch, and then they are baked, grilled, or, particularly prepared as the famous Cornish dish 
star gazey pie. Pilchards used to be salted and smoked all over the West Country and were known there as Cornish 'fair maids,' 
a corruption of fumado, the Spanish word for smoked, which no doubt became current when Spanish fishing fleets used to assemble off the Cornish 
coast in the 18th century. It is possible that some of the curious sunken pits to be seen in Cornwall were used for the smoking of the these 
fish in early times. In the 18th century and earlier, oil was extracted from pilchards. The best season for pilchards is the 
latter half of the year. They are chiefly obtainable canned in a strong tomato sauce which entirely destroys their original
 flavour." <br>
---<i>Food of the Western World: An Encyclopedia of Food from North America and Europe</i>, Theodora Fitzgibbon [Quadrangle New York Times 
Book Company:New York] 1976 (p. 340) 
<p>
<b>[1875] </b><br>
"Pilchards are rarely found on the British shores except on the coasts of Cornwall and Devon, particularly the former, where 
the are captured in great numbers from the middle of July to the end of November, or even the middle of December. Cornish fishermen 
say that the pilchard is the least fish in the sea for size, the most in number, and the greatest for gain taken from the 
sea. The principal seats of the pilchard fishery are St. Ives, Mount's Bay, and Mevagissey. The fish are captured either by seans or by 
drift-net. A sean is a net 200 to 300 fathoms long, and over ten feet deep, having cork buoys on one edge and lead weights 
on the other. Whenever the fish are brought on shore they are carried to cellars or warehouses, and piled in large heaps, a sufficient 
quantity of salt being placed between the layers. After remaining in this state for about thirty-five days they are carefully 
washed and cleaned, and then packed in hogsheads, containing on an average 2,600 fish. They are then pressed, so as to extract the oil, of which each 
hogshead yields about three gallons, provided the fish be caught in summer. Those taken late in the season do not yield above a gallon 
and a half. The fresh fish in a hogshead of pilchards weigh about six hundred-weight, and the salt about six hundred-weight and a 
half; the weight of the hogshead, however, when cured and pressed, is reduced to about four and a half hundred-weight, including the 
weight of the cask, which ranges form twenty to twenty-four pounds. The quantity of pilchards taken at one time is sometimes 
extraordinary. Mr. Yavul, in 1841, mentions that an instance has been known where 10,000 hogsheads have been take in one port in a single day, thus 
providing the enormous multitude of over 25,000,000 of living creatures drawn from the ocean for human sustenance. Pilchards are not used in 
England except in Devon and Cornwall. They are principally exported, and are largely consumed in some parts of the continent 
during the season of Lent. The taste of the pilchard is very like that of the herring, but it is more oily. Even after much of the oil has been 
removed by pressure, it is still as rich as could be wished." <br>

[NOTE: This book offers a recipe for Pilchard and Leek Pie (A Devonshire Dish), instructions for cooking pilchards and a line 
drawing of the fish.] 
<p>
<b>[1877] </b><br>
"Pilchard, called also the gipsy herring, is a fine fat fish most abundant on the Devonshire and Cornwall coasts; but it is to be found 
all over the Channel, and on the French coast it goes by the name of sardine. They are large for sardines, but they are treated as such 
in Devonshire and Cornwall, and are now sold in tins under the name of Cornish sardines. The result is worthy of praise, and ought to be the beginning of a 
successful industry. It is the first attempt in England to preserve fish in oil. It would be too much to say that they are equal 
to the best French sardines--that was not to be expected in a first experiment; but still they are good, well-flavoured sardines; 
and when the Cornish men--Tre, Pol and Pen--have thoroughly mastered the are of preserving fish in oil, their fat little 
pilchards should be known as the finest sardines in the world, and the perfection of preserved herrings. We know little of the pilchard 
in London, or anywhere far from Land's End. The fact is, that being the most sublime of herrings, with a richness which 
raises him almost to the nobleness of a salmon-trout, the pilchard, with all his fatness, begins to spoil much too soon after he has bidden 
adieu to his native element; and he is by no means sublime--he is even rancid--when he reaches the glorious Walhalla of fish in Billingsgate. 
Whenever a pilchard is found fresh, he is to be cooked as a herring of high degree. His season is between July and 
Christmas. It is singular, considering the goodness of the pilchard, that he is of no repute when cured, and is not to be named beside 
the bloater of Yarmouth, the salt erring of the Dutch, or the red herring of Scotland. Probably the larger pilchards, with their salmon-trout 
flavour, might make a name for themselves in the form of kipper; and there is now every prospect that the smaller pilchards will 
spread their renown in the guide of Cornish sardines." <br>

"Pilchards. Those are found in great numbers on the coasts of Cornwall and Devon. They are very oily, and are only eaten in the uncured 
state in or near the places where caught; but they are cured in large quantities after the oil has been extracted by pressure; even 
then, they are very rich. While fresh, they may be dressed like herrings, and the pilchards in oil--sold in tins, the Cornish 
are the best--are very useful as a breakfast dish, or they may be converted into little savouries in the same way as sardines. The cost 
in the fresh state is uncertain; tinned ones are about 1s for the best brands. In Devonshire, a pie is made of pilchards and 
leeks, but the taste is an acquired one, and it would probably not prove palatable to those unaccustomed to such a combination. The fin of 
the pilchard is just in the middle of the back; it is thus easily distinguished from a herring."<br>

According to the Cornish Sardine Management Association, <a href="http://www.cornishsardines.org.uk/historical-background.html 
">"Cornish Sardines"</a> was coined in 1997. Our research confirms this appellation was used for pilchards in the 19th 
century.

"An edible mollusc found in all the oceans of the world, especially in cold regions." <br>
---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i> [Crown Publishing:New York] 1961 (p. 638) 
<p>
<b>Why do we call them "mussels?" </b><br>
"...that delicious mollusk in the blue-black, hinged double shell, which we call mussel because the Romans called it musculus...Musculus literally means 'little mouse' (mus). Evidently the household rodent and the edible coastal shellfish struck the ancients as similar... In the flexing of the bicep, Romans saw an even that reminded them of the movement of a mouse...In English, we now make an orthographic distinction between the two, but modern Italian continues to reflect the ancient confusion. It uses the same word, muscolo, for thews and for mussels. From the gastronomic (not to mention physiological) point of view, there is no real confusion here at all.When we eat mussels, we are eating muscles (as well as other tissue). Adjuctor muscles hold the two shells of the mussel tightly together. The cook's job is to make those muscles relax so that he or she can get at the little 'mouse' inside."

<p>
<b>When did mussel farming (aquaculture) begin? </b><br>
"Among European mussel eaters, the French claim to have possessed the first mussel farm, in 1235, their national pride no whit diminished by the fact that it was an 
Irishman who established it, and his achievement, if it can be called that, was the result of a series of mistakes. His first error was to become so unpopular with the police that it 
seemed advisable to leave Ireland in a hurry. His second was to do so in a boat unequal to its task. His third was to become wrecked on the coast of France. His fourth was to 
try to feed himself by trapping sea birds. To this end he drove a few stakes into the water at the edge of the beach, in the form of a W, his initial (his name was Patrick 
Walton), and stretched nets among them. The sea birds declined to fly into the nets, but after a time he noticed that mussels had attached themselves to the stakes and were growing 
famously there; he shifted from game to seafood. He is also credited for having invented a flat-bottomed boat, name an acon, capable of navigating on a heavy dew, to harvest 
his mussels from their shallow-water habitat. The stakes are called bouchots, and in France today the most prized mussels are moules de bouchots, smaller, tenderer, paler and 
tastier than other kinds, and twice as expensive. Assuming that the tale is true, it does not make Patrick Walton Europe's first mussel cultivator, even if it is not 
exact, as some writers allege, that the ancients were raising mussels at Taranto about 500 BC, lowering bundles of branches or ropes into the water for mussels to cling 
to. The ancient Gauls seem to have been cultivating mussels before the Romans came; and when the Romans arrived they did the same (but in beds, not on stakes); Patrick Walton's 
acon is mentioned in the capitularies of Charlemagne only about AD 800." <br>

Mussels can be skewered with bacon and broiled. They fry beautifully when breaded or when coated with yeast or beer batters. Italians open them raw, discard one shell, and sprinkle them with grated cheese, parsley, minced garlic, and a little olive oil before running them under the broiler. Mussels lend themselves beautifully to fish soups. A bouillabiasse parisienne is a bouillabaisse with mussels in it. Mussels go well on pizzas.

"Mussels are the oysters of the poor, said Grimod de la Reyniere, and they ought to be favoured also by the rich, for there is scarcely a shell-fish which surpasses them in 
flavour. Especially in these days, when oysters are dear, mussels might occasionally take their place in sauces and stews. The French are wise, for they still hold the mussel in regard--it is one of the 
chief attractions of that noble ragout, the Normandy Matelote. In England--be it said with shame--the mussel is chiefly used for bait; it is rarely seen at any good English 
table--it is only in houses where the French style of cookery reigns that it is to be had. People are afraid of mussels because once or twice they have proved to be 
hurtful. So have mushrooms; so have melons: but still mushrooms and melons are eaten. Mussel-poisoning must be extremely rare--or we should know more about it. Our 
science is not so backward that if, among the myriads of mussels which the French consume, the cases of poisoning were numerous." <br>

"The Atlantic coast Indians had non-poisonous mussels and were afraid to eat the; the Pacific coast Indians had poisonous mussels and ate them all the same. Nearly half of the flesh 
food consumed by prehistoric Pacific coast Indians was provided by shellfish; and among shellfish, in a kitchen midden found on Catalina Island dated ate 4000 to 
3500BC, two kinds dominated all the others--the abalone and the mussel." <br>

"In most of North America, mussels were almost ignored as a food source until the last half of the twentieth century. Mussels were known in Europe and Great Britain as edible, although some cookery literature pointed out that people sometimes became sick after eating them...There was very minor commercial gathering of mussels for the New York market, and an effort was made around the turn of the twentieth century to persuade consumers to use them. In the last few decades of the twentieth century, with clams becoming scarce and expensive and with the public becoming more aware of various ethnic mussel dishes, the shellfish grew in popularity."

"In the past, freshwater mussels have been gathered commercially in the United States, and Illinois has always been a leader in the harvest. During the 1800s, mussels were used to manufacture tons of pearly buttons. The button industry continued to grow here and abroad and, in 1932, some 54.2 million pounds of mussels were gathered nationwide by professional fishermen."

"Among the lesser-known prizes available to New Yorkers are mussels, known in France as the poor man's oyster. Throughout the winter months they are relatively plentiful at first-class fish markets here and the cost is relatively low. Although mussels are the base for some of the most delectable dishes known, some cooks forswear them on the grounds that they are difficult to clean. And indeed they well may be. Mussels spend their existence clinging to rocks and piers with enormous tenacity and a fiber-like tuft outside the shell is a characteristic...Perhaps the best known of all mussel dishes is the simplest. It is called mussels a la mariniere. "One of the sublime creations of all time, however, is billi bi, a cream of mussel soup. It is made with the cooking liquid of mussels, egg yolks and heavy cream. After the dish is made, the mussels may be reserved for another use or they may be taken out of thsell and served in the soup."

<b>Clams</b><br>
"Though not an English mollusk, the clam was sufficiently similar to the English mussel and
cockle to be readily adopted into the colonists' diet. On occasion, it was even admired...There
were practical reasons why there was little enthusiasm fo rshellfish. On the simplest ground, the
settlers, coming mostly from the middle levels of European society, would have considrered a
hardship any diet that relied exclusively on one food, if only seasonally. Also, while they
employed Indians as shellfish gatherers, the English were sometimes forced to collect this
resource themselves, and this was no easy task. Obtaining enough shellfish to sustain a family was
exhausting work...It was during the eighteenth century that the clam began to escape its old
associations for the colonists and to assume a new identity as an agreeable food. But the process
was a slow one...the clam was becoming a symbol not only of the scarcity of the early years but
rather of the natural abundance that fed the revered founders...In fact, many different seashells
"were being incorprated regulary in physcial as well as symbolic form in American
commemorative celebrations by the end of the eighteenth century...The shell had...become a
symbol of American cornucopia...As the nineteenth century progressed, the new notion of
shellfish, especially clams, as symbols of bounty and celebration took firmer hold...Clams were
entering the cuisine in chowders, soups, stews and pies. But clams also retained older
associations with simple sustencance and were till eaten as inexpensive everyday fare..."<br>

<b>Clam bakes</b><br>
The history of the "traditional" New England clam bake might surprise you. <a href="foodlobster.html#clams">Clams</a> were indeed
plentiful, but the early American settlers considered them starvation food. The practice of the New England clam bake,
as we know it today, began after the Civil War.<p>
  
  "Indians, it is said, discovered clambaking first. Back before history, they had learned how to cook
  clams and other seafood in pits dug on the beach, usuing hot rocks for heat and wet seaweed for
  steam. When the Pilgrims arrived, the Indians taught them how to do these clambakes, along with
  a lot of other useful things, and this tradition was passed along, unbroken, in Yankee culture form
  generation to generation, down to the present eay. Or at least that's how the story usually goes,
  asserted and "proven" time and time again in the reports of archaeologists and antiquarians, in
  various culinary histories, in journalistic, literary, and poetic renderings, and in the testimonies of
  enthusiastic modern-day clambakers and clam eaters. A statement such as "The Pilgrims learned
  the ingenious technique [of clambaking] from the Indians" is a succinct presentation of an idea
  that is not only commonly accepted but that has also substituted for other, more rigorous attempts
  to chronicle the presence of this unique foodway on American soil. The fact that there is no direct
  proof for this particular history of clambaking marks the beginning of the story I will try to tell. 
       A close study of the evidence suggests that instead fo being a seamlessly organic
  development, the transmission of a clambake tradition has been uneven, at best, and, at worst,
  shows signs of having been extremely "unnatural." However we may ultimately judge its role within
  native American cultural practices, the clambake within a Yankee contect has been consistently
  manipulated for a variety of proposes. Particularly during the late nineteenth century,when
  clambaking reached the zenith of its popularity, the clambake appears to be a by-product of a
  combined romantic and capitalistic fervor. "Invented tradition" is the term historians Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger have given to
  phenomena like this--revered folk customs and ritual complexes that appear to be based on older
  social orders but that are, in fact, constructed and reconstructed by different groups and
  generations in such a way as to legitimate existent institutions and values."<br>
  ---<i>Clambake: A History & Celebration of An American Tradition</i>, Kathy Neustadt [University of
  Massachusetts Press:Amherst] 1992 (p. 15-16)
  <p>
"Generations of historians incorrectly record that the New Rngland clambake is the survival of a native custom learned by the first
English colonists. Archaelogidal and hsitorical evidence supports clam eating by Native Americans, but not by the newcomers, who
identified them with 'savagery.' Clams were a starvation ration to the Europeans, who used the abundant shellfish to feed pigs. The
clambake myth arose from the social and political changes grough about by American independnce. The new nation needed an icon of its
unique cultural identity, and an 'ancient ritual' featuring indigenous food provided it. It is no accident that the popularity of the
clambake exploded after the Civil War, when a new national myth was again created. Plymouth replaced Jamestown as the cradle of
America, and the 'New England' clambake became an American institution. The advent of mass transportion in the late nineteenth century
gave businessmen the opportunity to turn the clambake into a tourist industry...No longer exclusive to New England, clambakes seem to require only that the clams
be cooked by setam. A 'traditional' calmbake occurs in a pit dug in the sand of the beach where the clams are gathered. The pit is
lined with rocks, and a fire is built over them. Then the rocks are white hot, they are covered with layers of seaweed, clams, and other
foods. A wet tarp is laid over all until the food is cooked. Items typically included on the menu are lobster, corn, white
potatoes, clam chowder and cold beer."<br>

"A Clam Bake.</b><br>
An impromptu clam bake may be had at any time at low tide along the coast where clams are found. If you wish to have genuine fun, and to know what an appetite 
one can have for the bivalves, make up a pleasant party and dig for the clams yourselves. A short thick dress, shade hat, rubber boots,--or, better still, no boots at 
all, if you can bring your mind to the comfort of bare feet,--a small garden trowel, a fork, and a basket, and you are ready. Let those who are not digging gather a 
large pile of driftwood and seaweed, always to be found along the shore. Select a dozen or more large stones, and of them make a level floor; pile the driftwood
 upon them, and make a good brisk fire to heat the stones thoroughly. When hot enough to crackle as you sprinkle water upon them, brush off the embers, letting 
them fall between the stones. Put a thin layer of seaweed on the hot stones, to keep the lower clams from burning. Rinse the clams in salt water by plunging the 
basket which contains them in the briny pools near by. Pile them over the hot stones, heaping them high in the centre. Cover with a thick layer of seaweed, and a 
piece of old canvas, blanket, carpet, or dry leaves, to keep in the steam. The time for baking will depend upon the size and quantity of the clams. Peep in 
occasionally at those around the edge. When the shells are open, the clams are done. They are delicious eaten from the shell, with no other sauce than their own 
briny sweetness. Melted butter, pepper, and vinegar should be ready for those who wish them; then all may "fall to." Fingers must be used. A Rhode Islander would laugh at any one trying to use a knife and fork. Pull off the thin 
skin, take them by the black end, dip them in the prepared butter, and bite off close to the end. If you swallow them whole, they will not hurt you. At a genuine 
Rhode Island clam bake, blue-fish, lobsters, crabs, sweet potatoes, and ears of sweet corn in their gauzy husks are baked with the clams. The clam steam gives
 them a delicious flavor. Brown bread is served with the clams, and watermelon for dessert completes the feast."<br>

seriously; their was probably the first civilisation in which snails were kept and fattened for the table. The made a suitable

"The first French snail recipe was given around 1390 (by the author of the Menagier de Paris [a
cookbook]), but was not echoed in other medieval French cookery texts such as the Viandier of
Tallevent. The only reference to snail-eating in the 15th century seems to imply that it was
practised in Lombardy rather than in France. In the 16th century there are numerous signs of a
more positive attitude and it is clear that they were served at banquets. Of particular note is their
inclusion in a little booklet published in 1530, whose title translates as A Noteworthy Treatise
Concerning the Properties of Turtles, Snails, Frogs, and Artichokes by Estienne Laigue. The
author criticized four foods that he felt were all equally bizarre but popular with his
contemporaries. Of the four, he was kindest to this snail...After 1560 snails went into a decline
for about 90 years, culminating in a virtual banishment from refined tables for almost 200 years
thereafter. The evidence for this was abundant. If a cookery book gave a recipe for snails, it
would be with an apology for introducing such a distasteful foodstuff...not a single one of the
best restaurants in Paris in 1815 had snails on the menu...although snails were absent from
Parisian tables at the beginning of the 19th century, they were being eaten in the eastern
provinces...When the great comeback began, in the 1840s, and turned into what, despite the slow
locomotive habits of snails, might be called a flood in the 1850s and 1860s, it could be seen to be
linked to the spread of brasseries in Paris; and there were typically opened by Alsatians,
neighbours who doubtless shared the taste of the snail-eaters in Lorraine...Certainly, the
comeback was very noticeable and achieved so complete a reinstatement of the snail that it has
stayed in place ever since."<br>

Sharks have been relished in many cultures and cuisines for hundreds of years. In China, <a href="foodasian.html#sharksfin">

In the United States shark consumption is a 20th century phenomenon. We were surprised to

<p>
"For aestetic reasons sharks have never been a popular food in America, at leat not under their correct name. Yet, both primitive
and sophisticated cultures have utilized sharks as food since ancient times. Although the flesh of some sharks is known to have a strong
purgative effect on man (the cow sharks) and in some instances may be toxic, as in the case of the Greenland shark which is perfectly edible when
allowed to ferment in making Eskimo tipnuk or the Iceland hakarl, other species are an excellent food. The factor that prevents 
large-scale marketing in America is largely psychological, and not indicative of an inferior product. In 1916 the U.S. government embarked
upon a campaign to promote a small shark known as the 'dogfish' as a source of protein, and a substantial market existed until the
end of World War I. This diminished until the period from 1937 to 1941 when an intensive commercial fishery was conducted for high-potency
vitamin A shark livers. The flesh was purveyed under the name 'grayfish,' which did not promote sales, nor did later use of the already
popular 'whitefish' gain currency. Nevertheless, as much as 9 million pounds of shark was landed in one year in California
alone. After begin processed for liver, the edible parts were sold. This was the peak of shark consumption in the U.S...Along the
coast of Maine old salts called the dogfish harbor halibut."<br>

"Shark steak will be the piece de resistance at the annual banquet of the Society for the Propagation of the Truth About
Sharks. Which is soon to be held. The society includes no vegetarians in its circle, and, as far as we know, has not a single
member who has any qualms about eating the fair game that is sought by the human species. It is chiefly concerned with reduing the
sum total of human fear, by showing that the shark is far from being the frightful creature so often pictured by the human
imagination in its mood of distortion. Not a little of this fear of sharks is a pure psychological reaction. To be beautiful is
to be good, and to be ugly is to be damned."<br>

"'I know a fellow who prefers a nice mako shark steak to swordfish...I'm not an enthusiastic fish-eater, but mako and dogfish
(a species of sharl)...are very tasty...[John G.] Casey, acting director of the Narragansett Marine Gamefish Laboratory,
is convinced that sharks are a significant United States fisheries resource, a resource that is currently neglected. In
Japan, Europe and Africa hundreds of tons of shark are consumed annually. Commercial landings in the United States are about six
or seven million pounds annually...To this writer's knowledge, few, if any, of the shark steaks or fillets retailed for human
consumption in the United States are labled shark. Although some people migh turn up their nose at shark meat, most Americans who
served in the Euopean Theater during World War II probably didn't realized the dish of England's famous fish and chips was usually
dogfish or school shark."<br>

"It seemed only fair that a beast responsible for the dark paranoia of millions of moviegoers should now supply some sustenence
 in the shape of Shark Steak, Shark Benedict, and succulent Shark Marseille. Eating shark, apparently, is the latest spin-off from
"Jaws," and while the sophisticates along the Eastern seaboard and in Florida and California will no doubt lay claim to eating it all
the time, it is just beginning to find a market in Chicago...'The trend has created an instant demand...Even then there are only a 
few sharks that are edible. The most popular one is the Mako.'And fly it in from the coast they did...First Shark Steak, grilled over
charcoal, then Shark Benedict...Shark Marseille--thin strips of shark cooked in butter and sherry, with all manner of 
seasoning...Part of the shark shortage problem is that there is no industry set up for catching shark for the table. Recently, 
fishermen who have caught them have take only the jaws and teeth, which then are sold at inflated prices. The meat has been
thrown away. Now, as the food becomes more and more popular, the fishermen are selling to restaurants all over the country...
Most people...approach eating shark apprehensively, and it certainly looks formidable as it is being cut up...The popular opinon
tha shark tastes like swordfish...it is a clean, dry taste with virtually no fish smell. It is also rich in vitamins and
minerals and has almost as much protein as canned tuna. One big disadvantage is the price. It retails at around $2.95 a 
pound."<br>

  "Shark meat, once disguised under names such as flake and steak fish, has become an
  acceptable alternative to higher-priced tuna and swordfish. Fishermen say they get $2 to
  $2.50 a pound at the dock for prized mako shark steak and about 50 cents a pound for
  the less desirable species. A shark fin brings $5 to $10 a pound. The Fulton Fish Market
  Retail Store at the South Street Seaport in New York sells mako shark to consumers at
  $5.95 a pound, swordfish at $8.95 a pound and tuna at $9.95 a pound."<br>

  Street Journal</i>, September 20, 1990 (p. A1)

  "For years swordfish was relegated to the role of token fish offering on meat-oriented
  restaurant menus. Now it seems forgotten in the throng of more exciting-sounding and
  less expensive fish. Swordfish likely never will be inexpensive because the large,
  dramatic-looking fish with the swordlike upper jaw is caught by time-consuming longline
  harpoon rather than nets. Indeed, the high price of swordfish tempts some dealers to pass
  off similar-looking mako shark steaks as the real thing."<br>
  ---"Swordfish may be pricey but its good qualities make it ideal for fast meals," Patricia Tennyson,
  <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, August 1, 1991 (p. 10)
  <p>
<b>[1993]</b><br>
  "At one time the cry "shark!" quickly brought panic and mayhem. Now, it's more likely a
  call to the dinner table. If seafood is part of your regular diet, there's a good chance you've
  unknowingly dined on this fish more than once. For instance, a "swordfish steak" may
  actually be mako shark; "scallops" are sometimes sharkfin plugs. In many locales, "Fish
  'n' Chips" might be more appropriately called "Shark 'n' Spuds." Certainly, shark by any
  other name still tastes as good, but why not choose to eat it for its own sake? With a
  minimum of preparation and proper cooking, it provides excellent, firm steaks; if you
  don't go offshore yourself, it's usually reasonably priced at retail fish markets; and your
  local fish purveyor has already done the hard work. Once it reaches retailers, shark meat
  has been bled, cleaned, and is nearly ready to cook. If you buy over the counter, select
  shark steaks or fillets that have a clean, white color and no yellowing, blood spots, or
  freezer burn (if the steaks were frozen). Whether the meat had to be thawed, is "fresh
  local," or came from your own efforts, soak it in milk for at least 1 hour before any other
  preparation takes place. A milk marinade tames the gamey flavor and readies the meat for
  just about any savory whitefish recipe. Once soaked, shark can be grilled, broiled, baked,
  fried in strips, or used in chowders, stocks, stews, and soups."<br>
