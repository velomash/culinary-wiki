<font color="#003366" size="+1"><b>Manhattan</b></a></font><br>
"Because of its unrivaled tonic qualities as a restorative and element for firming the moral fiber, as well as because of the prevailing
American taste for drinks with whisky bases at this time, the classic and standard Manhattan cocktail, precisely as it is served at this red
hot minutes at the Stork Club, was an almost universtal rite until the end of the nineteenth century.
<blockquote>
<b>Manhattan Cocktail</b><br>
2/3 oz. rye whisky<br>
1/3 oz. Italian vermouth<br>
Decorate with maraschino cherry, stir, and serve in 3 oz. cocktail glass." (p. 19)
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="martini">
<font color="#003366" size="+1"><b>Martini</b></a></font><br>
"There are, of course, a good many redactions and vatriations of the Martini which depends for its sweetness or dryness on the proportions
and which gin and vermouth are used, but the standard and universal dry Martini is still the simplest and most effective mixed
drink ever devised:
<blockquote>
<b>Dry Martini</b><br>
2/3 oz. Londons or dry gin<br>
1/3 oz. French vermouth<br>
Stir, decorate with olive and serve in 3 oz. cocktail glass.
</blockquote>
The Perfect Martini, somewhat smoother and less potent to the taste, is achived by using the same proportions of gin and
vermouth, but equal parts of French and Italian vermouth are used...A vast deal of bother has from time to time been raised over the 
almost fanciful advantages of stirring over shaking Martinis. The almost universal custom is for stirring them, but Marco, head barman
at New York's celebrated Colony Restaurant, makes a practice of shaking them vigorously and candor compels the admission that the
only discernable difference between the two products is that a spooned Martini is crystal clear while a shaken one inclines to a 
clouded appearance. Bar practice at the Stork favors the noncontroversial stirring or spooning, but the management will oblibe by
having them componded in a cement mixer or butter churn if that is what the customer wants." (p. 20)
<p>
<a name="alexander">
<font color="#003366" size="+1"><b>Alexander the Great</b></a></font><br>
"In improvement, as some may think, on the conventional Alexander cocktail is the brainstorm child of Nelson Eddy and he calls it
'Alexander the Great.'
<blockquote>
<b>Alexander the Great:</b><br>
1/2 oz. creme de cacao<br>
1/2 oz. coffee liqueur<br>
1/2 oz. fresh cream<br>
1 1/2 oz. vodka<br>
Shake until cold as Siberia. Watch ytour Steppes, because more than three of these gives the consumer a wolfish appetite." (p. 33)
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="commando">
<font color="#003366" size="+1"><b>Commando Cocktail</b></a></font><br>
"Sometimes the name of the drink has nothing to do with its content, occasison or potentialities and represents nothing more than
a dead hand of tradition or the momentary whim of its originator or popularizer. On other occasions, however, it is indicative of the nature of the 
consequence of the potation, and such would seem to be the case with several of the absinthe arrangements hereinafter catalogued...
<blockquote>
<b>Commando Cocktail</b><br>
1 1/2 oz. bourbon<br>
2/4 oz. triple sec<br>
2 dashes pernod<br>
juice of half lime<br>
Shake and serve in a 3 oz. cocktail glass." (p. 37)
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="champagne">
<font color="#003366" size="+1"><b>Champagne Cocktail Gloria Swanson</b></a></font><br>
"Glamourous and worldy Gloria Swanson, a celebrity unabashed in her tastes and determined on the best, likes to start the day with what, within
the memory of the author used to have been known on the Continent as 'Kings Ruin,' because it was the traditional favorite of so many of the old,
bearded kings of Europe who used to frequent Foyot's, the Cafe de Paris, Maximes and the Ritz in the days when the going for kings
was good. Miss Swanson prefers to call it more elegantly a champagne cocktail even though she commands it served in a tall
Tom Collins glass:
<blockquote>
<b>Champagne Cocktail Gloria Swanson</b><br>
1 pint iced champagne, very dry<br>
2 oz. the best cognac<br>
twist of lemon peel<br>
Served in a tall Tom Collins glass with a cube or two of ice." (p. 44)
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="french75">
<font color="#003366" size="+1"><b>French 75</b></a></font><br>
"In the same family as the various versions of champagne cocktail is the celebrated French 75, and elixer which, if it did not actually
have its origin in the first of the German wars, at least come to the general attention of American drinkers at that time and was
immediately enshrined in the pharmacopoeia of alcohol artistry in the United States upon the conclusion of hostilities in 
1919.
<blockquote>
<b>French 75</b><br>
2 oz. gin<br>
1 tsp. powdered sugar<br>
juice of half lemon<br>
cracked ice<br>
Top with champagne and serve in a tall glass." (p. 45)<br>

<a name="ward8">
<font color="#003366" size="+1"><b>Ward Eight</b></a></font><br>
"Generally speaking, the history of the origins and evolution of a particular drink are lost in the shades of antiquity or of last
evening as the case may be. Not so the Ward Eight. Perhaps because it came into being in a community noted for the orderliness of
its thoughts and its fastidious devotion to history, perhaps because of the circumstance that it first saw the light of  day in 
premises particularly favored by newspaper men and other literati, we knwo where and approximately when the Ward Eight first leaped at the throat of an 
astonished world. Lock-Over's Winter Place Wine Rooms, a venerable Boston institution and still to this day the town's foremost
restaurant, taproom and resort of masculinity, was locateed in the eighties as it is today in Winter Place, a short news running between 
Temple Place and Winter Street...But a stone's throw from the Massachusetts State House on Beacon Hill and famed for its lobster 
Savannah and planked steaks, it was natural that Locke's should be a resort of politicans and followers of the political
scen. Locke's was not and is not in Boston's Ward Eight, but in the peirod under consideration Ward Right was a cominant
political subdivision of the community and it was natural that a new drink should be christened for this powerful arrondissement.
Although the fame of the Ward Eight was carried afar, it remained and is to this day a particular favorite in Boston and,
if the thirsty enquirere is in the vicinity of the Brimstone Corner, he can conveniently drop by Locke's and admire the oldest
cash register in North America, the Tom and Jerry machine...
<blockquote>
<b>Ward Eight</b><br>
2 oz. rye<br>
juice of half lemon<br>
4 dashed grenadine<br>
Shake and serve in tall glass with cracked ice, fruit." (p. 52-53)
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="daiquiri">
<font color="#003366" size="+1"><b>Frozen Daiquiri</b></a></font><br>
"The Stork will compound as many drinks with Cuban rums as there are days in the year, but the three which are dominant in their field...are...
Frozen Daiquiri...Cuba Libre...& 'MacArthur' Cocktail.
<blockquote>
<b>Frozen Daiquiri</b><br>
2 oz. silver rum<br>
juice of half lime<br>
1 tsp. sugar<br>
dash of maraschino<br>
shaved ice
Use electric mixer. Serve unstrained in champagne glass with short straws." (p. 56)
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="sidecar">
<font color="#003366" size="+1"><b>Sidecar</b></a></font><br>
"The Sidecar was, to the best of the knowledge and belief of the author, invented by Frank, steward and senior barkeep of the 
celebrated Paris Ritz Bar during the golden age of the early twenties. In an era when Joe Zelli's, Harry's New York Bar and the men's  bar 
on the Cambon side of the Ritz were probably the three best known tillping Taj Mahals in the world and when every Atlantic
liner set down hundresds of solvent and thirsty Yanks full of devalued francs, Frank of the Ritz Bar was a sort of universally 
recognized king of saloonkeepers and was, in fact, a very pleasant, generous and understanding friend to thousands of Americans.
There was nothing either cheap or popular about the Ritz and there was no dandruff on the morning jackets of its customers, who
included Evander Berry Wall, the then King of Spain, the Prince of Wales, Phil Plant, William B. Leeds and the Russian 
Grand Dukes living in exile in Paris. The men's bar was also the hally romping and stomping ground, in summer, of most of
Harvard, Yale and Princeton withan occasional democratic leaven of Williams or Dartmouth. The Sidecar was invented by Frank, so far as
fallible human memory can determine, about 1923 as a sort of companion piece to the Stinger only with even more expensive
ingredients. It was always built by Frank for favored customers with the Ritz's own bottling of a Vintage 1865 Cocnac and set one back, in this 
redaction, the then equivalent of five American dollars.
<blockquote>
<b>Sidecar</b><br>
1 3/4 oz. brandy<br>
3/4 oz. cointreau<br>
juice of half lime<br>
Shake and serve in 3 oz. cocktail glass." (p. 73-74)

<a name="zombie">
<font color="#003366" size="+1"><b>Zombie</b></a></font><br>
"Although of comparatively recent origin and evolution, the Zombie is a drink the precise source of which, like its exact economy,
is subject to controversy. The author first encountered it as an aid to practical alcoholism in the celebrated premesis of Trader
Vic in Oakland, California, and almost immediately after that in a bamboo bar frequented by Hollywood script writers in search of
inspiriation for more than customary intellectual chaos. It may ber well, as adverstised, have been imported from the far isalnd places or it may just
as palusibly have been the fevered brainchild of Trader Vic himself, an opportunist whos ethics are unmuffled by any consideration of 
human well-being, but, whencever it came, the Zombie exploded into fullest flower at the New Yor World's Fair. It was the principal
stock in trade of the Hurricane Bar in Flushing Measows and was retailed one to a customer at a dollar a sample by a management at
once thrifty and mindful of municipal ordinances. Actually it as not as lethal as advertised, but expediency will limit its
consumption by the inexperienced, as the variety and proofs of the rums involved are both chancy elements in the human
reckoning. As will be apprarent from the complexity of its ingredients, a Zombie is subject to multiple variations...
<blockquote>
<b>Zombian</b><br>
1 oz. amber rum<br>
1 oz. silver rum<r>
1 oz. Jamacia rum<br>
4 dashes cherry brandy<br>
4 dashes apricot brand<br>
1 dash papaya juice<br>
juice of half lime<br>
Serve in tall glass with cracked ice. Top with 1/2 pz. 151 proof rum. Stir. Decorate with green and red cherry and slice of orange. Serve
with straws." (p. 77-78)

"Don Ameche frowns a masculine frown upon mixed liquor in any form on the understandable grounds that he is an admirer of straight
bourbon whisky and no nonsense about a chaser. But Bonita Granville offers what she contents to be the barkeep's answser to the atomic bomb:
<blockquote>
<b>Snow White</b><br>
5 oz. Southern Comfort<br>
1 oz. vodka<br.
1 oz. fresh pineapple juice<br>

3 oz. 151 proof Rum<br>
3 oz. vodka<br>

<b>What was the Stork Club like in the 1940s?</b><br> 
This popular restaurant review sums it up best: "These are the places where syndicated columnists and the people they write about pretend they could live without each
other. <br>
<b>Stork Club</b> 
3 East 53rd: PLaza 3-1940<br>
Sherman Billingsley's 'glammer school,' strict in it standards; any infraction of good manners is punishable by quite but
prompt expulsion and permanent blacklisting. Even the atmosphere you breathe is specially cleaned and filtered. Lighting 
is just right and service incredibly wonderful. Food? Anything you desire. Drinks? Any brand hyou hame. If your party is
sizable and squired by someone of the successful business-executive type, the waiter will look surprised if no champagne is
ordered. Layout consists of: islanded bar confronting you as you enter; cocktail lounge, off which are the glassed-in main 
dining room (dining and dancing) and the Cub Room (small, quite, seating only about 100); and, upstairs, a small Loners' Room for 
singleton eating, and the Blessed Event Room for private-party occasions. The Stork Club opens at 11 A.M. for the benefit of 
late breakfasters. Packed at luncheontime, with the Cub Room operatingon a men-only basis. Cocktail time, crown has a choice of the bar,
the lounges, or the main room, where there's music for cocktail dancing--followed by music to eat to. If you're elegantly thrifty in a leisurely
sort of way, you'll take the flat-priced five course BT ("Before Taxes") Dinner. Should you prefer to be fed faster, there's a
BC Diner at stepped-up tempo for theater curtain beaters. Dance tempos (and cabaret tax) resume at 9, with never a skipped beat till closing,
and with a continuous two-way traffic of Stork glamorites arriving and departing. Attire is optional, but when tables are
scarce, strangers may find itto their advantage to present themselves at entrance chain (solid gold)in their best evening
togs. A young college man escorting a dazzling goddess is sure to get in, because Mr. Billingsley is proud of having his
tables embellished by the fairest. Sunday opens at 1 P.M."<br>

<b>What kind of food was served at the Stork Club in 1946?</b><br>
Lucius Beebe's <i>Stork Club Bar Book</i> (1946) groups contents in to sections titled: Morning, Noon & Night. There are no food notes in the
morning section. Noon & Night menu notes follow. This book does not divulge recipes but we do learn Madeira & mushrooms were favored
ingredients.
<p>

<b>[Noon]</b><br>
"Should the matter of food, at an appropriate pause in the rounds of restoratives rear its dainty head at this juncture, the management of the Stork stands ready and 
willing to purvey certain dishes which have become favorites with luncheon patrons and half a dozen of which are here briefly mentioned. All standard variations on 
the luncheon theme may be taken for granted as avialble on the ample house menu: these are specialties and indigenous to the premesis at No. 3 East Fifty-third
 Street. Omelette Steve Hannagan was named for one of the Stork's first patrons, oldest inhabitants and the closest confident of the management for no more 
elusive reason that Mr. Hannagan favors his omelette garnished with diced mushrooms, fried eggplant and stewed tomatoes. Shirred Eggs Bibesco are compounded
 with a julienne of tongue, mushrooms and the best Perigordine truffles in a Madeira sauce, while Scrambled Eggs Divette are lovingly chafed in fresh butter and
 thick cream and garnished with sliced Louisiana shrimps of outsize porportions in a shrimp sauce with asparagus tips. If something more robust is in order, there is 
Minced Chicken Montlord: whole slices of thick white meat in cream sauce, illustrated with truffles and mushrooms and interlaced with Virginia ham in long slices. 
Calves Liver Hommil is a familiar saute of liver and the added feature supplied by sauce Smitaine, while Veal Sweetbreads Rose Marie are broiled with half tomato, 
French fried Eggplant, the heads of fresh mushrooms and Madeira sauce." (p. 49-50)
<p>
"If, by the time this point is reached in the Stork's catalogue of vinous and spiritous offerings, either the reader of the bar patron is inclined, in the interest of complete equilibirum, to command solid food, the chef's suggestion for the day may variously embrace:<br>
<b>Bluefish Saute Sherman or Stork Club</b><br> Bluefish saute with plain spinach, sliced mushrooms and Meuniere Sauce.<br>
<b>Veal Chop Saute Concorde:</b> Veal chop saute in butter. garnished with carrots Vichy, mashed potatoes, new peas, Madiera Sauce.<br>
<b>Baby Lamb Boulangere:</b> Roast Baby Lamb, Garnished with glaced small onions and salted pork and potatoes Rissole. Mint sauce.<br>
<b>Noisette of Lamb Lavalliere:</b> Noisette of Lamb in butter garnished with julienne of mushrooms and truffles. Puree of celery., Madeira Sauce.<br>
<b>Veal Cutlet Gismonda:</b> Breaded Veal Cutlet with half bread curmbs and half grated Parmisan cheeese, saute in butter, garnished with plain spinach, sliced mushrooms. Madeira Sauce. <br>
<b>Lamb Kidney Saute Cabaret:</b> Lamb Kidney Saute, Red Wine Sauce. Garnished with small onions, mushrooms, and salted pork." (p. 61-62)
<p>
<b>[Night]</b><br>
"It is possible that long before the thirsty reader or patron as the case may be has exhausted this overwhelming catalogue or potables, or vice versa, the inner man or inner woman may be clamoring for solid nutirment and, whether they are served adjacent to the dance floor, in the Cub Room, the Blessed Events Room or elsewhere on the Stork premisis, these are a few of the house specialties which make it difficult for Jinx Falkenberg to retain her figure:<br>
<b>Filet Mignon Capuchine:</b> Garnished with broiled stuffed mushrooms, creamed spinach, Bernaise Sauce.<br>
<b>Guniea Hen:</b> Breast of Guinea Hen-Saute of garnished asparagus tips. New peas. Madeira Sauce.<br>
<b>Tournadas Baltimore:</b> Small Tenderloin Saute with mushrooms smothered with onions. Sliced veal kidney, stewed tomatoes, German fried potatoes.<br>
<b>Lamb Chop Saint Hilaire:</b> Lamb chop stuffed with chicken hash, garnished with sliced green pepper, stewed tomatoes.<br>
<b>Minced Tenderloin of Beef a la Deutsch:</b> Sliced Tenderloin, garnished with green peppers. Tartlet of cream corn. Chateau Sauce.<br>
<b>Pheasant Casserole Derby:</b> Roast Pheasant stuffed American style. Garnished wtih dried truffles and floie gras, Madeira Sauce.<br>
<b>Royal squab Knickerbocker:</b> Roast Royal Squab in casserole garnished with artichokes. Bottom Parisienne potatoes covered over with chopped hard boiled egg, bread crumbs, and parsley. Madeira Sauce.<br>
<b>Squab of Guinea Hen--Steve Hannagan</b> Squab of Guinea Hen, split and saute in butter, garnihsed with sliced oranges, black cherries. Porto Sauce<br>
<b>Broiled Chop of Venaison Ground Veneur:</b> Brouiled chop of Venaison garnished with puree of chestnut, Sauce Poivrad and currant jelly.<br>
<b>Aiguilette of Duckling Florida:</b> Aiguilette of duckling in top of crouton of hominy, garnished with stewed pears, oranges and apples and pineapple. Porto sauce.<br>
<b>Minute Steak Chez Toi:</b> Steak Saute, garnished with diced potatoes, small glace onions and mushrooms.<br>
<b>Breast of Chicken Rimini:</b> Breast of chicken-Pique with truffle--serve in crustade. Puree of mushrooms. Supreme Sauce.<br>
<b>Squab Chicken Louisiane:</b> Fried squab chicken breaded. garnish with sweet fried potatoes, stewed corn, fried bananas Rue Pilaw, Maryland Sauce." (p. 83-85)
