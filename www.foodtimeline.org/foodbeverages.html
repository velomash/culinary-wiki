The question "Which came first: beer or wine?" does not have a definitive answer. Food historians tell us progenitors of these items likely happened by "accident" long before mankind began producing them. Both are predicated on stable, stationary civilizations. The Archaeological evidence confirms wine and beer were regularly consumed by the Neolithic period. While none of our historians state outright one predates the other, brewing may present some older evidence. 
<p>
<b>About the origin of alcoholic beverages</b><br>
"Like so many discoveries, the creating of most fermented liquors probably came about by accident. As certain types of sweet fruit, and also honey, will ferment on
 their own accord, it was inevitable that any attempts to collect such fermentable substances in containers would on more than one occasion encourage alcohol
 formation...Certainly the fermented drinks of the Old and New Worlds represent independent discoveries, and it could well be that the development of rice 
beverages in eastern Asia was quite unconnected with that of the varied cereal and wine concoctions in the European area."<br>
---<i>Food in Antiquity: A Survey of the Diet of Early Peoples</i>, Don Brothwell and Patricia Brothwell, expanded edition [Johns Hopkins University Press:Baltimore MD] 1998 (p. 164-165) 
<p>

<b>Beer</b><br>
Ancient brew & <a href="foodbeverages.html#beerrecipes">recipe ingredient</a> too. 
<p>
"No one has yet managed to date the origins of beer with any precision, and it is probably an impossible task. Indeed, there are scholars who have theorized that a 
taste for ale prompted the beginning of agriculture, in which case humans have been brewing for some 10,000 years...Most archaeological evidence, however, 
suggests that fermentation was being used in one manner or another by around 4000 to 3500 B.C. Some of this evidence--from an ancient Mesopotamian trading 
outpost called Godin Tepe in present-day Iran--indicates that barley was being fermented at that location around 3500 B.C....We know that not much later the
 Sumerians were...making beer...At approximately the same time, people of the ancient Nubian culture to the south of Egypt were also fermenting a crude, ale-like 
beverage known as bousa."
<br>---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kenneth F. Kiple & Conee R. Ornelas [Cambridge University Press:Cambridge] 2000, Volume One (p. 620) 
<p>
"The brewing of beer may well have occurred soon after the production of cereal crops, and no doubt for a long time beer was home-produced and in the hands of 
the housewives responsible for preparing the 'gruel' or bread. Malting the grain is the first step in beer-brewing, but malting--that is, allowing the grains to germinate
--was initially carried out to make the grains more palatable. After malting, besides being mixed into a nourishing gruel, the grains could also be dried, milled and 
baked into a more easily preserved kind of bread. Thus, the first production of beer may be reasonably considered as an accidental discovery resulting from the
 malting of grain for other purposes. When cereals came to be more often baked into bread and less often turned into gruel, malting was not so necessary and 
became part of the brewer's trade only. By the third millennium BC, Mesopotamia was already well versed in beer-brewing and old Sumerian texts mention eight
 barley beers, eight emmer beers and three mixed beers. Aromatic plants were added to the beer to improve the flavour and to assist in its preservation, and extra 
honey, cereals and malt gave varying added strengths. Up to the millennium, the grains were de-husked, but husked grains then began to be brewed and beer was 
drunk through the drinking-tubes to be seen in several relief carvings...Brewing followed much the same pattern in Egypt, where too it originally went hand in hand 
with baking...As early as the Pyramid Age five kinds of beer were noted...Indeed, it is considered that the ancient brewers probably made stronger beer than we 
now know, owing to the wild yeast which caused the fermentation that produced a greater alcohol content...Beer, to the Greeks and Romans, was a barbarian 
drink...The North European peoples of those days such as the Celts and the Germans did not yet know the wine-grape and the art of viticulture, so after the 
introduction of cereal agriculture their drink remained beer for a very long time."<br>---<i>Food in Antiquity</i> (p. 166-167) 
<p>
"...much of the artistic evidence of the early days of brewing in the Near East, the commencement of which we believe to be around 8,000 years ago, suggests a 
strong link with bread-making. This relationship seems to have been perpetuated by the time that the ancient Egyptians started to brew..."<br>

<a name="beerrecipes">
<b>Beer an ingredient in food</b><br>
The yeasty connection between beer and bread/cereal grains (batter!) is as old as human agriculture. Beer
as an ingredient in cookery is a specialty of northern European countries, most notably Belgium, the
Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, and Great Britain. Beer is most often employed as a rising agent,
steaming medium, thinning ingredient, and flavoring additive. Some of the more famous beer/food recipes
are carbonnades flamandes, beer soup, <a href="foodfaq1.html#fondue">fondue</a>,
batter encrusted cheese, <a href="foodbeverages.html#beerbatter">beer batter</a>, and 
<a href="foodfaq1.html#rabbit">Welsh rabbit</a>. Beer Waffles are included in <i>A Belgian Cookbook</i>,
Juliette Elkorn [Farrar Strauss and Cudahy:New York] 1958 (p. 210).
<p>
<a name="beerbatter">
<b>Beer batter</b><br>
Our survey of country-specific cookbooks and beer history texts suggests beer batter, as we know it today, descends from
 <a href="foodbeverages.html#beerrecipes">northern Europe</a>, possibly in the middle ages. 
Beer batter seems to gained popularity in the USA during the 1970s and 1980s. Several articles printed in the
<i>New York Times</i> review restaurants featuring a variety of beer batter/deep fried vegetables and meats. Three
of the most popular recipes are for onions, mushrooms and shrimp.
<p>
"Beer is one of the world's most favorite drinks, and most Americans think of it as just that and nothing more.
Curious, because it is by no means a novelty in cooking. In the world of international cuisine, perhaps the best
known of all beer dishes is the carbonade flamande of Belgium, a dish made with cubed beef, a lot of onions
and a conspicuous quantity of light beer. Books have been written on cooking with beer...it is not at all
surprising to find it used in recipes that call for a leavening agent. We are not all that enthusiastic about the
universal use of beer in the kitchen with one exception, and that is as a beer batter. A batter containing beer
as a leveaning agent is perhaps the finest of all. It is also one of the easiest of deep-frying batters to prepare,
as it has a multitude of applications."<br>

<b>Wine</b><br>
"The earliest archaeological evidence indicating wine that might have been made from domesticated vines comes from a pottery jar, dated between 7400 and 7000 
years ago, which was found at the Neolithic site of Hajji Firuz in the northern Zagros Mountains."<br>
<br>---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kenneth F. Kiple & Conee R. Ornelas [Cambridge University Press:Cambridge]
 2000, Volume One (p. 730) 
<p>
"Whilst the Greeks on the whole are responsible for initiating specialized viticulture which ultimately spread throughout the Mediterranean and into France and 
Germany, the vine is indigenous to Asia Minor and it was probably among the people of that area that viticulture had its true beginnings. We know from their texts 
that the Hittites were enthusiastic vine-growers and wine-producers. Viticulture was known in Mesopotamia as early as the third millennium BC, and was probably 
well under way in Egypt even before dynastic times. Although the vine is not indigenous there, pictorial representations appear in tombs of the earliest dynasties and
 the Pyramid Texts indicate at least six varieties. All large gardens grew grapes along with dates and figs, but the wine still had to be imported from Syria and 
Palestine, where viticulture was of primary importance. So wine remained in Egypt a drink for the rich, with beer and water for the peasants, until the arrival of the 
Greeks in the Hellenistic period. Mesopotamia too, whilst producing wind from a very early date, did not make sufficient for the masses...There is some dispute 
about the antiquity of wine-drinking in Crete and the Aegean, and it has been postulated that beer was probably drunk prior to wine...Wine-production in Italy is
 thought to have been initially introduced by the Etruscans."<br>
---<i>Food in Antiquity: A Survey of the Diet of Early Peoples</i>, Don Brothwell and Patricia Brothwell, expanded edition
 [Johns Hopkins University Press:Baltimore MD] 1998 (p. 167-169) 
<p>
"Unlike brewing, wine-making is a natural process which does not strictly require any human intervention--in fact, apes Often seek out fermenting fruits. To make 
wine, all that is needed is for the juice of a ripe grape to come into contact with airborne yeast. Wine-making, then, was not 'invented' by man: humanity's role is a
 more modest one, to refine and guide...From prehistoric times onwards, wine could be made wherever people and grapes coincided. Yet there is little doubt that, 
of all the vitis species, vitis vinifera is the most suitable for wine. Vitis vinefera is believed to have originated south of the Black Sea in Transcaucasia, now the 
disputed territories of Georgia and Armenia, since this is the area that had the greatest variability of human population at the time and was therefore where humans
 were most likely to have started using it...Archaeologists assume that by 7000 BC previously nomadic farmers in the Near East had taken up grain-farming and
 stock breeding. Domesticating fruit trees involves a different kind of existence. The first wild fruits to be domesticated in the Near East were the fig, the date, the
 olive and the vine...Deliberate cultivation of fruit trees such as the vine therefore presupposes a fully sedentary way of life and a complete social and economic 
system, with one generation leaving property to the next. This stage was probably reached in the 4th millennium BC or possibly the 5th...However, cultivation of 
Vitis vinifera is not necessarily the a same thing as wine-making...Archaeologists have found remains of presses dating from the Bronze Age (i.e. c. 3000 to 1050 
B.C.). Finds of empty grape skins together with pips and stalks at Myrtos, Crete, from the early Minoan period (i.e. c. 3000BC) are proof of wine-making as 
opposed to the production of table grapes. That the earliest piece of evidence is not a grape skin or a stalk or a pip at all; it is a wine stain. In the early 1970s a 
Persian amphora dating from 3500BC was found at Godin Tepe, Iran. Recent chemical analysis of the red stain inside has shown that it contains both tannins and
 tartaric acid, suggesting that the amphora must have had wine in it."<br>

<b>What is a “library wine?”</b><br>
  

“Such a "library wine" can prompt stories about earlier days of the winery that made it, or remind a winemaker of what seemed to be a minus in the weather one year 
that ended up a plus in the bottle…A library wine, despite some wineries using the phrase as a marketing tool, by definition is one that is no longer available 
commercially. What remains of the vintage is collectors' cellars or several cases the winery holds back for private tastings and to serve as a product record.”<br>

<b>What’s the difference between “library wine” and a “wine library?”</b><br>

A wine library can mean several things. <ul>

<li>One is a traditional [special] library devoted to the topic of wine. These generally collect books, magazines, media, and archival documents supporting the mission. St. Helena Public Library [CA] partners with the group below.

<li>A wine library can also mean a collection of old wines for the purpose of retaining notes on vintage, vintners, and other historic notes. The <a href="http://www.foodtimeline.org/%94http://www.napawinelibrary.com%94">Napa Valley Wine Library Association</a> is a prime example.

<li>The name in commercial/retail application can mean a store offering an extensive array of wine, typically over and above the standard liquor store. Example: Wine Library (NJ-based retail wine store) was trademarked in 1994.

<b>Hot, non-alcoholic</b><br>
<a href="foodbeverages.html#coffeeamerican">Coffee</a>, tea and <a href="foodbeverages.html#hotchocolate">chocolate</a> were popular non-alcoholic hot beverages during American Colonial times. These imports were expensive, but not beyond the reach of 
the average person. Folks too poor to afford the real thing brewed hot beverages from herbs, flowers, bark, roots, and woody stems. Alas, there was no ready 
substitute for chocolate! Presumably, cider could have been served warm too.
<p>
"The slave labor system and the expansion of international trade that brought sugar, molasses, and rum into prominence also led to the rise of three new 
nonalcoholic drinks: chocolate, tea, and coffee. "Groceries" was the term used in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries for newly imported consumable 
commodities from distant places."<br>
---<i>America's Founding Food: The Story of New England Cooking</i>, Keith Stavely & Kathleen Fitzgerald [University of North
 Carolina Press:Chapel Hill NC] 2004 (p. 266)
<p>
"...chocolate was a popular drink for all ages. The beverage was simple to prepare for the imported cocoa beans were merely ground and then brewed for the 
desired thickness with water or milk. As Americans moved further into the eighteenth century, chocolate and coffeehouses became popular in seaport towns such as
 Boston, New York, and Phildelphia...The taste of coffees, teas, and chocolates was unpredictable at best. Today's beverages are a smooth blend of leaves or 
beans of many types. However, in colonial times, a ship's cargo usually included not a mixture of several strong and mild beans, but only the products of a single 
plantation. Past experiences with the crop of a particular producer were of little value in judging later shipments, for changing climatic and soil conditions altered the 
tastes of a particular grower's crop from year to year...When coffee was not available or was beyond the means of the poor farmer, parched rye, chestnuts, or
 grape seeds were substituted for coffee beans and brewed into hot drinks...Tea substitutes were also popular, particularly on the frontier where imported 
merchandise was difficult to purchase. Sassafras tea was considered particularly pleasing..."<ber>

<b>What did patriots drink instead of tea after the famous Boston party?</b><br>
"Colonial tea addicts were sorely tested when the nationwide tea strike
 began about ten years before the Revolutionary War. Supporters of the boycott against British tea published numerous testimonials by patriotic doctors who
 claimed that tea-drinking not only shortened the life of a drinker, but weaked his spleen and stomach...High prices as well as patriotism discouraged many from 
drinking tea...Rhubarb, goldenrod, strawberry, and blackberry leaves were also collected for brewing into tea during the long show of solidarity against the British. 
The later revolution saw a great decreas in the amount of American tea-drinking, and in the first years of the new republic, coffee became the overwhelming favorite 
drink. Though never to regain its prewar popualrity as a general beverage, tea remained popular as a medicinal home remedy for various illnesses, a turnabout from
 the boycott claims to the opposite effect."<br>
---<i>ibid</i> (p. 202)
<p>
"The young ladies of Boston signed a pledge, 'We the daughters of those patriots who have, and do now appear for the 
public interest, and in that principally regard their posterity, as do with pleasure engage with them in denying ourselves 
the drinking of foreign tea, in hope to frustrate a plan that tends to deprive a whole community of all that is valuable
 to life.' They were joined by others around the country, drinking instead 'Balsamic hyperion' made from dried raspberry 
leaves, or infusions of other herbs. The Boston Tea Party did not destroy the American taste for tea, although few 
retailers in Boston dared to offer it for sale for a number of years. George and Martha Washington continued
to serve the best quality tea"<br>

<b>What is beef tea?</b><br> 
A concentrated protein beverage extracted from the essence of beef used to restore human health from the 18th century forwards. Early recipes provided instructions 
using real beef. Variations permitted other animal proteins (veal, lamb, chicken) and occasionally included vegetables. Florence Nightengale used
beef tea to restore fallen Crimean War soldiers. American Civil War soldiers were likewise treated. In the 1880s commercial beef extracts 
were employed to make a quick beef tea. Some concoctions proved more healthful than others. A survey of late 19th/early 20th century 
USA newspapers and cook books confirm the popularity of homemade beef tea for the general malaise called "what ails you."
<p> 
<b>What were the healthful properties of beef tea?</b><br> 
"Beef tea may be used to advantage <br> 
1. To give variety to a liquid diet. <br> 
2. When much water is to be ingested. <br> 
3. On account of the warmth that it gives. <br> 
4. In cases of weakened digestion. <br> 
It stimulates the appetite. Meat extractives are the greatest know stimulants to gastric juice." <br>

<b>How to make beef tea?</b><br> 
<blockquote> 
<b>[1769]<br> 
"To make Beef Tea</b><br> 
take a pound of lean beef, cut it in very thin slices, put it into a jar, and pour a quart of boiling water upon it. Cover it very close to keep in the steam, let it stand by the fire. It is very good for a weak constitution. It must be drunk when it is new milk warm."<br>

[NOTE: This book also offers a recipe for Chicken Water, different from Chicken broth.] 
<p> 
<b>[1849] <br> 
"Beef tea.</b>--Cut a pound of the lean and fresh juicy beef into small thin slices, and 
sprinkle them with a very little salt. Put the meat into a wide-mouthed glass or 
stone jar closely corked, and set it in a kettle or pan of water, which must be 
made to boil, and kept boiling hard round the jar for an hour more. Then take out 
the jar and strain the essence of the beef into a bowl. Chicken tea may be made 
in the same manner." <br>

Hart:Philadelphia] 1849 (p. 414)

<b>[1865]</b><br> 
"-- The waste of beef in making beef tea is enormous. 62,000 lbs. a year are used in one London hospital alone; and if any 
head of a household, where there has been long illness, will just sum up the addition to the Butcher's bill in the shape 
of beef tea meat, he will be able to form some notion of the quantity used, and (many of the doctors are beginning to tell 
us) more than half wasted, throughout the country. At the present price of meat this is a very serious matter. It is
 LIEBIG's theory that in beef tea, properly made, you get all the nutritive part of the beef, and leave nothing but a 
worthless mass of bouilli behind. The <i>British Medical Journal</i>, on the other hand, asserts that fibrine is absolutely 
insoluble in water, and that a dog fed on beef tea dies as soon as one who gets nothing but mere water. If this be true, 
LIEBIG is as great a romancer in his way as the cook who, when asked by his noble master what use he could find for some 
thirty hams for one dinner, replied, "I shall put them all into no bigger as my thumb." We believe the safest way for the 
patient is to drink up that red meaty sediment which the "purists" so generally strain out. The fact is, LIEBIG's pint of 
tea, made from a pound of beef, yields by evaporation less than half an ounce of solid matter; and though we cannot admit
 that this "represents the whole nutritive matter contained in the pint of fluid," (for do not gases feed us?) the result 
is certainly startling. The <i>Medical Journal</i> makes two suggestions -- first, eat the bouilli, which, of course, can 
only be done by a stomach capable of digesting boiled beet; next, use more wine and less, beef tea in fever cases and the 
like. Wine is seldom rejected by the feeblest stomach, and it contains all the elements of the blood -- alkalies, iron, 
albumen, traces of most of the acids; besides, wine by itself will support life for a very long time. We heartily agree 
with this latter suggestion. Wine, by all means, for sick poor as well as for sick rich. But how, if you please, are
 middling folks to get it? Where is the parson, for instance, to buy it for his poor and for himself? Madeira is not; port 
is not -- i. e., not within the means of ordinary people. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has, they say, given us cheap
 claret; but will he make his gift doubly precious by telling us where we may obtain it sound? -- <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>."<br>

Take a slice of beef weighing half a pound, cut it in pieces half an inch thick, half 
broil it, put it on a plate, sprinkle it with a little salt, cut it in pieces an inch square, 
put it into a pitcher, and turn in it a pint of boiling water. Cover it up tight; let it

"Beef Tea from Fresh Meat</b> (Baron Liebig's Recipe)<br>Take one pound of lean beef, entirely free from fat and sinew; mince it finely and mix it well with one pint of cold water. Put it on the hob, and let it remain heating very gradually for two hours. At the end of that time, add half a teas-spoonful of salt and boil gently for ten minutes. Remove the scum as it rises. This is beef tea pure and simple. When a change of flavour is required it is a good plan to take one pound of meat composed of equal parts of veal, mutton, and beef, and proceed as above. Or, instead of using water, boil a carrot, a turnip, an onion, and a clove, in a pint ot water, and when the flavour is extracted strain the liquid trough a fine sieve; let it get quite cold, and pour it upon the minced meat, soaking and boiling it for the same time.

recipe: <br> 
"You take one pound of absolutely fatless silver tip of beef and on a double sheet of 
butcher paper or a wood board cut it into tiny dice. Place it and any juices the meat has 
yielded in the top of a double boiler and gently cook, covered, over simmering water for 
several hours. Do not use salt or pepper. Simply leave the meat alone to give off its 
juices. After several hours you will be left with pure essence of beef, perfectly digestible 
and nourishing. Strain into a warm bowl, then press out any additional juice from the 
meat." (p. 109)

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Bloody Mary cocktail</b></a></font><br>
Bloody Marys (<a href="foodbeverages.html#tomatojuice">tomato juice</a> & vodka), like Mimosas (<a href="foodbeverages.html#orangejuice">orange juice</a> & 
champagne), are generally classed today as socially acceptable morning cocktails. 
The restorative properties of vitamin C fruit juices infused with the "hair of the dog that bit you" has been 
debated for many years. Morning after <a href="foodbeverages.html#redeye">beer and tomato juice drinks</a> also descend from this
tradition. 
<p>
<b>Who can we thank for inventing the Blood Mary?</b><br>
Fernand Petoit & George Jessel. Each in his own way. Classic "origin" stories here:
<p>
"The Bloody Mary is a cocktail made with vodka, tomato juice, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, cayenne pepper and salt. Folklore
attributes the origin of the Bloody Mary to Ferdinand 'Pete' Petiot, a bartender at Harry's Bar in Paris. Petiot purportedly first
mixed vodka with tomato juice in 1921. After Prohibition ended in 1933, Petoit moved to the United States and became a bartender at
the King Cole Bar at New York's St. Regis Hotel, where he added Worcestershire sauce and pepper to the recipe. Petiot named the
drink either after a girlfriend called Mary or after Mary Tudor, the mid-sixteenth-century Catholic queen of England...While the
story is plausible, it is unlikely. An essential Bloody Mary is tomato juice, which was not available commercially until 1929...
It may never be known who first paired tomato juice with vodka, but the other two claims have some plausibility. The first is that it was
invented in the 1930s at New York's 21 Club by a bartender named Henry Zbikiewcz...A second claim attributes its invention to the comedian 
George Jessel, who frequented the 21 Club. The first known recipe for the Bloody Mary was published in Lucius Beebe's <i>
Stork Club Bar Book</i> (1944). Beebe, a columnist for the <i>New York Herald Tribune</i> mentioned the Bloody Mary in December
3, 1939: 'George Jessel's newest pick-me-up which is receiving attention from the town's paragraphers is called a Bloody Mary: half
tomato juice, half vodka.'...The Bloody Mary made its national debut in a magazine advertisement that appeared in late 1955 featuring
George Jessel, who declared he invented the cocktail."<br>
---<i>Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America</i>, Andrew F. Smith [Oxford University Press:New York] Volume 1, 2004 (p. 104-105)
<p>
"In its earliest incarnation, the Bloody Mary was little more than tomato juice and vodka in equal measure employed as a hangover
cure. John Steinbeck would later describe its curative powers in terms that embrace the drink's ruddy name and appearance: 'It is elixir,
it is pretty close to a transfusion.' Comedian, songwriter, moveie producer and raconteur George Jessel--the 'Toastmaster General
of the United States'--laid claim to having created the cocktail. In the '50s, he even appeared in Smirnoff ads, declaring 
'I, George Jessel, Invented the Bloody Mary.' In his 1975 autobiography, Jessel told a fantastical story about the morning in Palm
Beach when--after a nonstop night of drinking--he devised the first Bloody Mary...Given Jessel's knack for self-promotion, many
doubted his claim, and that opened the door for the head barman at New York's St. Regis Hotel. Fernand 'Pete' Petiot was serving
Bloodies--under the alias 'Red Snapper'--at the hotel's King Cole Bar by the start of the 1940s. Once the Bloody Mary became a national
senation in the 1950s, Petoit would claim that he had invented it while working at Harry's Bar in Paris in the 1920s. But dogged
etymololgist Barry Popik, a consulting editor of the <i>Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America</i>, has found that the 
earliest references to the Bloody Mary all credit the drink to Jessel. The first was...1939...<i>New York Herald Tribune</i>...
Petoit qualified his own claim in a 1964 interview with the <i>New Yorker</i>. 'I initiated the Bloody Mary of today,' he declared. 
'George Jessel said he created it, but it was really nothing but vodka and tomato juice when I took it over.'"<br>

<p>
<b>[1955: Jessel connection]</b><br>
"I, George Jessel, invented the Bloody Mary.' I think I invented the Bloody Mary, Red Snapper, Tomato Pickup or Morning Glory,' reports
George Jessel. 'It happened the Night before a Day and I felt I should take some good, nourishing tomato juice, but what I really wanted
was some of your good Smirnoff Vodka. So I mixed them together, the juice for the body and the vodka for the spirit, and if I wasn't the
first ever, I was the happiest ever. The Recipe: To a glass of the best tomato juice you can get add a jigger of mellow Smirnoff 80

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Cappuccino</b></a></font><br>

We are intrigued by the origin & evolution of cappuccino. Much information is available on espresso (beverage, machines, foodservice establishments) but precious 
little regarding this particular coffee offering. The connection between cappuccino and the Capuchin monks is tenuous at best. Mostly repeated legend. We 
have no proof these folks actually consumed this beverage. 
None of our historic Italian food history resources mention Cappuccino. Our survey of historic USA newspaper confirms the popularity of cappuccino in the early 
1950s. After WWII, many "foreign" foods, many of the Italian, were embraced by Americans. Older references mention ingredients (including cinnamon) but not 
proportions. 
<p>
"Cappuccino is the Italian term for coffee made with a head of hot frothy milk or whipped cream. The word means literally 'capucin', and its application to coffee is 
generally taken to be a reference to the colour of the habit work by monks of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchins, an independent branch of Franciscans (the 
word capuchin itself is derived ultimately from Latin cappa, 'hood', which comes from caput, 'head'). Cappuccino probably established itself in English in the coffee
 bars of the 1950s..."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 56) 
<p>
"Cappuccino...A traditional beverage of Italy, cappuccino is made by forcing steam through milk or cream to form a creamy topping for the coffee, though in 
America it may be served simply with whipped cream on top. The drink is supposedly named after a Capuchin monk in whose garden coffee was grown in Brazil in
 1774. Others say the name derives from the drink's resemblance to the tonsured heads of Capuchin monks."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food & Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 58) 
<p>
"Cappuccino is said to be named for the Capuchin monks for one or both of these reasons: the cafe au lait hute of the beverage resembles the monks' robes, or the
 recipe originated with the monks. Those who once taste it invariably order it again, and it is as popular as any of the coffees served in the [coffee] houses."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Carnation Instant Breakfast</b></a></font><br>
"Instant" was a popular term applied to several breakfast products in the 1960s. Our survey of historic newspaper ads
revealed instant orange juice (<a href="foodbeverages.html#tang">Tang</a>), cereal (oatmeal, wheat) and coffee. One of the most unusual 
combinations (by today's standards) was a product called Tren, "...a mixture of apple juice and egg." (<i>New York Times
</i> September 3, 1962 p. 9). Presumably, milk-based nutritient-fortified breakfast drinks descend from 
<a href="foodbaby.html">infant formula</a> and child-friendly 
<a href="http://www.ovaltine.co.uk/en/article.asp?chco_id=23">Ovaltine</a>. Powdered addition or pre-mixed in a can, 
these drinks were positioned pefectly for the unpenetrated adult market.
<p>
According to the records of the US Patent & Tradmark Office, "Instant Breakfast," a nutrient rich meal alternative products targeting adult consumption, was
introduced by  La Lanne Inc., Hollywood California, December 15, 1961. Jack La Lanne, the popular television "physical culturist" created his own
personal product line. Then, as today, nutrition claims were challenged by the US Food & Drug Adminstration.

The earliest print reference we find to Carnation brand Instant Breakfast 
Drink is 1964. The article indicates this product was test marketed prior to 
flooding the national market. This is a common practice in the food world. Many similar products (Metracal) were introduced in this period. They were aimed at 
busy, middle-income American women who wanted to lose weight.

Food historians confirm people have been making cider from <a href="fruit.html#apples">Apples</a> for a millenium. 
While most Americans today know the non-acloholic kind, "hard" ciders were favored in earlier times because they
could be preserved. 
<p>
<b>What is cider?</b><br>
"Cider, a term with two meanings. In N. America since Prohibition it refers to unfermented, unpasteurized, and usually unfiltered
apple juice...Alcoholic cider is now described as 'hard' cider...In Britain, cider is an alcoholic drink, for which special
cider apples are used."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2nd edition, 2007(p. 186)
<p>
<b>How old is cider?</b><br>
"Cider-making in England is already a consequence of 1066. No doubt apple juice had been fermented to make an alcoholic drink
in Anglo-Saxon times, but it was the Normans who introduced it in a big way. At first much of it was imported from Normandy...but
soon cider-apple orchards were being planted in Kent and Sussex, and it was not long before the apples, the technology, and the
taste of the drink spread throughout the more southerly parts of England...The Normans brought the word with them too: cider (or cyder, as
it is sometimes spelled in Britain) comes from Old French sidre, which was adapted from medieval Latin sicera. This in turn came
from Greek sikera, an approximation used in the Septuagint for Hebrew shekar 'strong drink', a derivative of the verb shakar 
'drink heavily'. As this potted history suggests, cider denotes etymologically any intoxicating beverage, and indeed that meaning 
survived in English as late as the fifteenth century...A drink made by watering and repressing the pulp from with the original
apple-juice for cider was pressed was known in former times as ciderkin or water-cider."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Atyo [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 77-78)
<p>
"The Anglo-Saxons had had some knowledge of 'apple-wine', but there is nothing to suggest that it was either made or drunk to any
extent in England before the Norman Conquest. Cider making was introduced from Normandy about the middle of the twelfth century, and
was at first confined mainly to Kent and Sussex. Sometimes Normandy cider itself was imported...The new beverage soon spread to
other parts of the country...Cider could be made from apples mixed with pears, but if the drink was prepared largely or entirely
of pears, it was usually called perry...Both cider and perry helped to save the grain for brewing, as did other country 
drinks."<br>
---<i>Food and Drink in Britain From the Stone Age to the 19th Century</i>, C. Anne Wilson [Academy Broadway:Chicago] 1991 (p. 382-383)
<p>
"Fruit juice was not really an option for the Tudors. Unfermented grape juice, 'must', was importd but would surely have been
a luxury as it cannot have lasted long...Citrus fruits were also expensive, and even though apples and pears were widely grown, 
preserving the juice was impossible. The only option was to turn it into cider and perry so that the alcohol would act as a
preservative. Cider and perry were still only widely drunk in certain areas of England, and...tended to be a special 
occasion drink."<br>

<a name="cocoa">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Cocoa</b></a></font><br>
Ancient Central American peoples celebrated religious ceremonies with <a href="foodmaya.html#hotchocolate">chocolate drinks</a>. 
19th century Dutch, British, and Americans drank <a href="foodbeverages.html#hotchoclate">hot chocolate</a> for breakfast. The staple pantry powder we take for granted today
is the perfect convergence of technological advancement, marketing savvy, and human quest for simple food that tastes 
good. The powder lends well as a recipe ingredient. Think: <a href="foodcandy.html#hersheyscocoafudge">Cocoa fudge</a>.
<p>
Our survey of historic cookbooks, newspapers and corporate texts confirms the word "cocoa" had three distinct meanings in 
the 19th century: <br>
<b>A. Raw food/commodity</b>--nut from a New World tree used to create several different products of different grades and processes, including chocolate. 
NOTE: It is important for researchers to examine early descriptions closely so not to confuse 
cocoa nuts (from the cocoa tree) with <a href="foodfaq.html#coconuts">cocoa nuts</a>
 (tropical fruit). <br>
<b>B. Commercial product</b>--manufactured by several companies, 1828 forwards under different names (breakfast cocoa, prepared cocoa, Broma (enriched
 product), ground chocolate, powdered chocolate, granulated cocoa. Not all cocoa was powder: cocoa nibs & cocoa shells are prime examples. <br>
<b>C. Recipe</b>--19th century <a href="foodbeverages.html#cocoarecipes">cocoa recipes</a> (& related beverage, (hot) chocolate) are all over the map. The two most prevalent recipes employ chocolate scrapings (boil with milk/water) or chocolate shells (brew like coffee/tea). Cookbooks did not generally include recipes for cocoa made with chocolate powder, as instructions for these preparations would have been on the company's package or advertisements. 
<p>
<b>About cocoa</b><br>
"Cocoa, a brown powder produced by grinding the roasted seeds of a topical American evergreen tree, has had a checquered linguistic 
history, owing to its confusion with the coconut. When the Spaniards first encountered cocoa in Central America in the early 
sixteenth century, they named it cacao, and adaptation of cacahuatl, the term for 'cocoa bean 'in the Nahuatl language. English 
adopted the Spanish word in the mid-sixteenth century,, and used it quite happily for the next 150 years or so. But then, around 
1700, we begin to see the first signs of cacoa, and the coco of the coconut...becoming associated in speakers' minds. Early 
intermediate forms were cacoa and cocao, which were still pronounced with three syllables, but by the end of the eighteenth 
century coca seems to have become firmly established, its -oa spelling revealing its exotic origin, but its pronunciation showing its 
complete phonetic assimilation to coco. The drink made from the product of the cocoa tree was originally called chocolate...The term 
cocoa was not widely applied to it until the end of the eighteenth century...And the drink we would recognize as cocoa today appeared 
later still. The process of manufacturing it, by removing a large proportion of the fat content (cocoa butter) to produce a 
lighter drink, was invented in 1828 by the Dutchman Coenraad Van Houten. This cocoa, often adulterated with flour, potato starch, 
and even earth, became a staple beverage of the nineteenth-century British working class, enthusiastically promoted by the 
temperance societies." <br>

<p>
"'Cocoa,' which is British English is often used to refer to what Americans call 'cacao' and 'chocolate.' in American English refers only 
to the defatted powder invented by the Dutchman Coenraad Van Houten in 1828...to confuse matters, the New York Commodities Market 
calls the unprocessed seeds 'cocoa'!" <br>

<a name="1828chocolate">
<b>Modern chocolate begins in 1828</b><br>
"1828 marks the beginning of the modern era in chocolate making and production. In that year, a Dutch chemist named Coenraad Johannes 
Van Houten took out a patent on a process for the manufacture of a new kind of powdered chocolate with a very low fat content. 
As early as 1815, in his own Amsterdam factory, he had been looking for a method better than mere boiling and skimming to remove most 
of the fat of the cacao butter from chocolate. For this, he eventually developed a very efficient hydraulic press untreated 
chocolate 'liquor'--the end result of the grinding process--contains about 53 percent cacao butter, but Van Houten's machine managed 
to reduce this to 27 or 28 percent, leaving a 'cake' that could be pulverized into a fine powder. This was was we know as 
'cocoa.' To cause this product to mix well with water, Van Houten treated it with alkaline salts (potassium or sodium 
carbonates). While this 'Dutching,' as it came to be known, improved the powder's miscibility (not, as some believed, its 
solubility) in warm water, it made the chocolate darker in color and milder in flavor...At any rate, in the year 1828, the age-old, 
thick and foamy drink was dethroned by easily-prepared, more easily digestible cocoa. Van Houten's invention of the defatting and alkalizing 
processes made possible the large-scale manufacture of cheap chocolate for the masses." <br>

"In the United States the increased consumption in recent years has been no less striking. The amount of cocoa retained for home 
consumption in 1860 was only 1,181,054 pounds; in 1885 it was 8,426,787 pounds (that is, cocoa, crude cocoa and shells, not including 
chocolate, which is classes, in the official returns of imports, under the general head of 'farinaceous articles')--and increase

FBEDERICK EVAN'S AND THOMAS DYSON, OF NEW YORK, N. Y. 
IMPROVEMENT IN APPARATUS FOR PREPARING CHOCOLATE AND COCOA. 
Specification forming part of Letters Patent No. 153,325, dated July 31,1874; application tiled June 30,1874. 
To all wliom it may concern : 
Be it known that we, Frederick Evans and Thomas Dyson, of the city, county, and State of New York, have invented a new and useful Improvement in Bolls for Preparing Chocolate and Cocoa; and that the following is a full, clear, and exact description of the same, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, and to the letters of reference marked thereon, making a part of this specification. 
This invention is in the nature of an improvement in rolls for preparing chocolate and cocoa; and the invention consists in a series of hollow rolls or drums, arranged and constructed so that a continuous current of cold water or steam may pass through them, in the manner and for the purpose hereinafter fully described. 
In the accompanying sheet of drawings, Figure 1 represents an end view of our rolls, partly in section; and Fig. 2, a side view of same, partly in section. 
Similar letters of reference indicate like parts in the several figures. 
As is well known, in the preparation of the cocoa-beau for the purpose of rendering it marketable as cocoa or chocolate, expensive and complicated machinery has heretofore been employed for this purpose; and in addition to this machinery, it has always been found necessary to subject the cocoa to repeated grinding, mixing, scraping, and melting, in separate operations, before it was rendered in a marketable condition as cocoa and chocolate. By our invention, however, this process is simplified and the cocoa-beans prepared as cocoa or chocolate without the use of expensive machinery or the loss of time in its preparation. 
A series or train of rolls, A, are constructed with hollow interiors, and are provided with hollow journals, a, and the necessary couplings, 1). These rolls are supported in suitable bearing-frames, B, and they are placed in pairs, one above another. To the end of each roll are secured gear-wheels e, that mesh into one another, and into the gears of a drivingwheel, E. Immediately over the surface of the upper rolls is provided a hopper, /, and between the rolls A, and also below the under 
rolls, are affixed scrapers g. These scrapers are adjustable by set-screws, and the rolls themselves are rendered adjustable by means of the adjustable bearings H, which, by the operation of the set-screws i, permit the rolls to be moved nearer to or farther from each other. 
Our rolls being constructed substantially as above described, they are operated as follows: Power being applied to the driving-wheel E, the rolls are caused to revolve, and if it is designed to prepare the cocoa-bean for merchantable cocoa, suitable pipes are attached to the couplings Z* and a current of cold water directed into the several rolls, filling them and finding exit through the couplings c at the other end of the rolls, keeping the rolls at all times thoroughly cooled. The cocoabeans, having been roasted in the ordinary way and deprived Of their shells, are cracked and introduced into the hopper/, whence they come in contact with the upper pair of rolls, A, and being crushed and ground between them, they pass to the second pair of rolls, (which may be brought closer together than the upper pair of rolls,) and in this way the cocoa is reduced until it emerges from beneath the rolls in a fine, granulated state, and it is at once ready for market and for use. If the rolls were not kept cool by the current of cold water through them, the friction created by the passage of the cocoa-beans between the rolls would heat them to such an extent as to partially liquefy or soften the oleaginous principle in the bean, and the cocoa would mass together in a stiif and almost unyielding substance, rendering it difficult to pass between the rolls and destroying its granulated form. 
When the rolls above described are to be used for the manufacture of chocolate, live steam, instead of a current of water, is passed into the rolls A in precisely the same manner as was conducted the water above mentioned, and by this means the rolls are heated to the temperature of the steam, so that when the cocoa-beans pass between them the heated rolls at once liquefy the oleaginous principle contained in the cocoa, and the heat, together with the pressure of the rolls, at once melts, as it were, or dissolves the cocoa into a homogeneous, ungranulated, and smooth mass, so that when it finally issues below the rolls it is iu the form of an unctuous paste, and is at once, and without farther preparation, ready for the market. If sweet chocolate is desired, sugar or other saccharine substance may be added to the chocolate, either as it passes through the rolls or afterward. To prevent the rollers becoming choked or clogged when in operation, scrapers <7, which are adjustable, as before mentioned, are secured to the frame B of the rolls, and these remove any surplus cocoa that may adhere to the surface of the rolls. 
153,325 
Having thus described our invention, what we claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is— 
Rolls for the manufacture of cocoa or chocolate, constructed with hollow interiors, in combination with steam or water pipes, substantially in the manner and for the purpose described.

IMPROVEMENT IN GRANULATED CHOCOLATE. 
Specification forming part of Letters Patent No. 215,341, dated May 13, 1879; application filed February 27, 1879. 
To all whom it may concern: 
Be it known that I, John Geokoe Finke, of the city, county, and State of New York, have invented a new and useful Improvement in Granulated Chocolate, of which the following is a specification. 
The object of this invention is to furnish chocolate so prepared that it may be ready for immediate use without scraping or grating, and so tbat one cup or more may be made ready at a time, as may be desired. 
The invention consists in granulated chocolate prepared by coating the grains of granulated sugar with melted chocolate, and in the process of preparing granulated chocolate by melting the chocolate cakes in a water-bath to which the heat is applied, stirring the granulated sugar into the melted chocolate until the grains of sugar are thoroughly coated, and then pouring the mixture upon a stone and stirring it until cold, as hereinafter fully described. 
In preparing my improved granulated chocolate, one or more cakes of chocolate, as found in market, are placed in a water-bath, to which the heat is applied. When the chocolate cakes are melted, granulated sugar, in the pro 
portion of ten pounds of sugar to one and three-fourths pound of chocolate, is poured in, and allowed to stand until the sugar is thoroughly heated, usually about two hours. It is then thoroughly stirred until every grain of sugar is coated with chocolate. The mixture is then poured upon a stone and stirred until cold. The granulated chocolate thus prepared is then sifted, and is then ready for use, or to be put up for market. 
I am aware that it is not newto form a chocolate-powder by triturating roasted cocoa or •chocolate beans or nuts to a paste in a heated mortar with sugar and aromatics, cooling this in molds, and, finally, grinding to a coarse powder. 
Having thus described my invention, I claim as new and desire to secure by Letters Patent— 
A chocolate breakfast-powder consisting of sugar coated with chocolate and in a granulated form, as described.

"Cocoa is from the seed of the fruit of a small tropical tree. There are several forms in which it is sold, the most nutritious 
and convenient being chocolate, the next cocoa, then coca nibs, and last cocoa shells. The ground bean is simply cocoa; ground fine 
and mixed with sugar it is chocolate; the beans broken into bits are 'nibs.' The shells are the shells of the barn, usually removed before 
grinding. The beans are roasted like coffee, and ground between hot rollers." <br>

"Cocoa, or chocolate nuts, are the seeds of the Theobroma Cacao, a handsome tree from fifteen to twenty feet in height, growing 
in Mexico, the West Indies, and South America. These seeds, or cacao beans, are roasted the same as coffee until the aroma is brought 
out. They are then pounded into a paste in a hot mortar, or ground between roller. The preparation thus produced, when mixed with sugar, starch, 
cinnamon, and vanilla, forms the chocolate of commerce. Cocoa is the bean ground fine, the oil partly extracted, and the remaining powder 
mixed with a small quantity of sugar. Cocoa Nibs is the bean deprived of its husks, and then broken into small rough pieces. This is the 
purest and best cocoa in our markets. The shells or husks are also used to make a weak decoction for persons with delicate stomachs." <br>

"Cocoa, The ground cocoa bean, from which part of the oil or fat has been extracted, sold in powdered form. Because of the smaller quantity of oil cocoa 
is more acceptable to many digestions than the richer chocolate. It may be added that the fact that the cocoa tin is not full when 
opened does not necessarily imply short measure. The tins used by manufacturers are larger than required for the weight called 
for, as cocoa fresh from the machines bulks a little larger than after it has been shake down in commercial handling." <br>

<b>Was powdered cocoa used in baking (cakes, cookies, puddings, candies, etc.) in the 19th century?</b><br>
Our survey of 19th century USA cookbooks does not suggest/confirm powdered cocoa was used in cooking. Primary push in those early days was drinkable 
chocolate easily digested by infants and invalids. Mid-19th century USA chocolate cake recipes were in fact white cakes with chocolate icing achieved by scraping
 chocolate. Evidence suggests powdered cocoa substitutions were early 20th century, most popular during the leanest of years when real chocolate was scarce.
 Think: Great Depression & WWII. Subsequent cocoa cake recipes were purely a convenience. Early chocolate cake recipes

According to the food historians, coffee was highly prized for its taste and perceived medicinal qualities. Some speculate
it was adopted as America's "unofficial" brew of choice as a gastronomic statement against British tea. <a href="restaurants.html#americancoffeehouses">
Coffee houses</a> lodged in urban areas.
<p>
<a href="foodbeverages.html#cowboycoffee">American pioneers</a> improvised 
creative methods for achieving drinkable pot of coffee. Success varied according to supplies and the exprience of the
cook. A person who could brew a delicious pot of coffee was highly respected. <a href="foodeggs.html#coffeeshells">
Eggshells</a> were commmonly employed as clarifying agents. <a href="foodbeverages.html#civilwarcoffee">Civil War soldiers</a> craved real
coffee. When the real deal was unavailable, a variety of creative <a href="foodbeverages.html#coffeesubs">substitutes</a> were employed.  
<p>
<b>Early American brewing methods</b><br>
"In the predominantly rural United States of the mid-nineteenth century, people bought green coffee
beans (primarily from the West or East Indies) in bulk at the local general store, then roasted and
ground them at home. Roasting the beans in a frying pan on the wood stove required twenty minutes of
constant stirring and often produced uneven roasts. For the affluent there were a variety of home
roasters that turned by crank or steam, but none worked very well. The beans were ground in a
manufactured coffee mill or a mortar and pestle. Housewives usually brewed coffee just by boiling the
grounds in water. In order to clarify the drink, or "settle" the grounds to the bottom, brewers employed
various questionable additives, including eggs, fish, and eel skins...The routine American ruination of
coffee must have surprised sophisticated European visitors. During the first half of the nineteenth
century there was a veritable explosion of European coffee-making patents and ingenious devices for
combining hot water and ground coffee, including a popular two-tier drip pot invented around the time
of the French Revolution by Jean Baptiste de Belloy, the Archbishop of Paris. In 1809 a brilliant,
eccentric expatriot named Benjamin Thompson--who preferred to be known as Count Rumford--modified the de Belloy pot to create his own drip version. Rumford also made a corred brewing
pronouncement: Water for coffee should be fresh and near boiling, but coffee and water should never
be boiled together, and brewed coffee should never be reheated. Unfortunately for American
consumers, however, Rumford's pot and opinions did not travel back across the Atlantic. Nor did the
numerous, elegant brewers from France and England...Typical North American coffee of the period
was boiled until it was a bitter brew badly in need of milk and sugar to make it palatable."<br>

"Virtues of Coffee: Coffee accelerates digestion corrects crudites, removes colic and flatulencies. It mitigates headaches, 
cherishes the animal spirits, takes away listlessness and languor, and is serviceable in all obstructions arising from languid
circulation. It is a wonderful restorative to emaciated constitutions, and highly refereshing to the studious and sedentary.

temptation of spiritous liquors. It will be found a welcome beverage to the robust labourer, who would despise a lighter

a most wholesome and pleasant jentacular beverage, first ordered by an able physician. Let one ounce of fresh ground coffee be
put into a clean coffee-pot, or other proper vessel well thinned: pour a pint and a quart of boiling water upon it, set it on

<b>Pioneer coffee</b><br>
According to primary documents pioneer (aka "cowboy") coffee was a hit or miss affair. Same as today,
everyone had their own idea as to correct proportions and cooking time. Filters ranged from fine
cloth to non-existent. Coffee grinders were often carried, and beans were ground on site. Ground
coffee was also available for purchase (in towns, packed in tins), but would probably not have
produced as fresh a brew. 
<p>
"Although Peter Burnett advised his family, "If you are heavily loaded let the quantity of sugar and coffee be small, as milk
is preferable and does not have to be hauled," his counsel was the exception. Most emigrants took the advice of Anna Maria
King: "Fetch what coffee, sugar and such things you like, if you should be sick you need them." By the time the travelers were nearing
either Oregon of California, coffee was sometimes the only provision left. Catharine Amanda Scott Coburn, and Oregon pioneer, 
recalled those times: 'We still had coffees, and, making  huge pot of this fragrant beverage, we gathered round the crackling
camp fire--our last in the Cascade Mountains--and, sipping the nectar from rusty cups and eating salal berries gathered during
the day, pitied folks who had no coffee.' A  story about coffee illustrates the relationship between Ellen Tootle and her husband,
newlyweds on their way to Colorado to look over the possibilities of expanding their dry-goods business to Denver: 'Mr. Tootle says I
cannot do anything but talk, so would not trust me to make the coffee. Boasted very much of his experience. He decided to make it
himself, but came to ask me how much coffee to take, for information, I know, but he insisted, only out of respect. The coffee pot
holds over 1 qt.; I told him the quantity of coffee to 1 qt. He took that, filled the coffee pot with water then set it near, but not
on the fire. I noticed it did not boil, but said nothing. When they drank it, they both looked rather solemn and only took one
or two sips. I thought it was time to have an opinion upon it. As Mr. Tootle would not volunteer one, I inquired how the coffee
tasted. He acknowledged it was flat and weak, but insisted I did not give him proper directions. He consented to let me try it
at supper time.' Later that evening Ellen Tootle had her chance to prove her culinary skills: 'I was all impatience to try my s
skill in making coffee. I watched it anxiously until it was boiling and waited with the greatest solicitude and I must
acknowledge some misgiving, for them to taste it. Oh, but I was rejoiced and relieved when they pronounced it very good.'
Before making a cup of coffee, the green coffee beans had to be roasted in a skillet and then ground in a grinder. The names of 
the beans indicated their place or origin, and we find Rio, Havana, and Java coffee beans listed for sale in the mid-
nineteenth century. If tea was preferred, the buyers chose from a list of brands that featured Gunpowder, Imperial, Young Hyson, 
Souchong, and Poushchongre. Not until after the Civil War did manufacturers devised good way of preserving the flavor of preroasted
or ground coffee, sometiems referred to as essence of coffee. But from March 30, 1850, St. Louis Missouri Republican this
ad suggests that they certainly tried. 'California Outfits. Ground Coffee--Put up in water-proof and air-tight packages and 
guaranteed to retain its strength and flavor for years.' The credit for a good roasted coffee goes to Arbuckle Brothers, whos
offices were in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The company patented a method of sealing in the roosted flavor by coating the
beans with a mixture of egg white and sugar. Roasted coffee beans in paper bags were then shipped throughout the West, and 
Arbuckle coffee was the most popular brand."<br>

Coffee beans were on the list of rations for both North and South. Primary accounts confirm they were highly prized. <a href="foodbeverages.html#coffeesubs">

"Coffee wes issued to Yankees rather steadily, in the form of raw beans that the men first had to roast without burning and
then crack with their rifle butts or somehow grind before boiling with water. At every meal the coffee came out, and if there 
was a halt of more than a few minutes on a march, some men were bound to start a fire and begin making the brew, often mmerely
to be told to throw it out unfinished as they resumed the march. While the coffee's caffeine may have been stiumulating to their 
spirits, the boiling also providentially killed much of what inhabited the poor water usually to be had. Confederates, by 
comparison, cut off from sources of importation, usually had to substitute chicory, burnt corn and peas, and even potatoes and 
peanuts, with far less satisfactory results. "Our coffee when we first went out was issued to us green, so that we had to roast
and grind it, which was not always a success, some of it being burnt, while some would be almost green," said Bellard. "In roasting
it we put a quantity of it in a mess man, and placing the pan over the fire would have to keep stirring it round with a stick in 
order to have it roasted as evenly as possible." They could never properly grind the beans, cracking them instead, and
inadequate roasting could turn the beverage awful."<br>

<p>
"In 1861, the standard daily ration in the Union army was based on the assumption that not all required ingredients would be
available at all times and places. As a result, it operated on an equivalent or what some called the "lieu thereof" or the "or" system...
Each day a soldier ought to be issued three-fourths of a pound of pork "or" bacon "or" one and one quarter pounds of fresh "or"
salt beef...His bread ration was to be eighteen ounces of fresh bread or flour or theree-fourths of a pound of hardtack or one and one
quarter pounds of cornmeal. Additionally, each 100-man company was to share eight quarts of peas or beans or ten pounds of rice, 
ten pounds of coffee or one and a half pounds of tea, fifteen pounds of sugar, four quarts of vinegar, and two quarts of salt. In 1861
the Confederate War Department adopted precisely the same ration allowance as the old United States prewar, excepting that it 
recognized the scarcity of coffee and sugar by reducing those from ten pounds of coffee to six and from fifteen pounds of sugar
to twelve. In any event the Southern commissary was rarely able to provide either of those items or those quantities after 1861, ar
at any distance from principal commissary and transport centers...In 1863, responding to the rigors of campaigning, the Union War
Department revised the ration to...[for every 100 rations] ten pounds of green coffee beans or eight pounds of roasted beans, 
or one and one half pounds of tea..."<br>
---<i>ibid</i> (p. 45-6)
<p>
"Finally there was coffee. Soldiers could go for days without food, if only they ahd their coffee. In the Confederacy it became as
highly prized as shoes, and commanded outrageous prices in times of scarcity. Substitutes were tried using chicory or
parched corn, but nothing approaced the real article. As a result, coffee was the item most often requested when Rebs informally 
met Yanks between the lines for illict trading. Virginia tobacco being the commodity exchanged. In the North, by contrast, there
was rarely any shortage of coffee beans, and many regiments were actually issued special rifles, one per 100-man company, with a 
coffee grinder built into the butt stock. The best coffee was slow roasted over a low fire, "until of a chestnut brown color and not burnt, as
is so commonly done." It was to be boiled briskly for two minutes, then take from the fire at once, a little cold water thrown in, then the 
boiler's contents poured through a piece of flannel after it had settled for five minuutes."<br>

"The manner in which each man disposed of his coffee and sugar ration after receiving it worth noting. Every soldier of a month's
experience in campaigning was provided with some sort of bag into which he spooned his coffee; but the some sort of bag he used indicated pretty
accurately, in a general way, the length of time he had been in the service. For example, a raw recruit just arrived would take it up in a 
paper, and stow it away in that well known receptacle for all eatables, the soldier's haversack, only to find it a part of a general
mixture of hardtack, salt pork, pepper, salt, knife, fork, spoon, sugar and coffee by the time the next halt was made. A
recruit of longer standing, who had been through this experience and had begun to feel his wisdom-teeth coming, would take his up
in a bag made of a scrap of rubber blanket or poncho; but after a few days carrying the rubber would peel off or the paint of the 
poncho would rub off from contact with the greasy pork or boiled meat ration which was his travelling companion, and make a black, 
dirty mess, besides leaving he coffee-bag unfit for further use. Now and then some young soldier, a little starchier than his fellows,
would bring out an oil-silk bag lined with cloth, which his mother had made and sent him; but even oil-silk couldn't stand everything, 
certainly not the peculiar inside furnishing of the average soldier's haversack, so it too was not long in yielding. But your plain,
straightforward old veteran, who had shed all his poetry and romance, if he had ever possessed any, who had roughed it up and down had ever
possessed any, who would roughed it up and down "Old Virginny," man and boy, for many months, and who had tried all plans under
all circumstances, took out an oblong plain cloth bag, which looked as immaculate as the every-day shirt of a coal-heaver, and into
it scooped without ceremony both his sugar and coffee, and stirred them thoroughly together. There was method in this plan. He had 
learned from hard experience that his sugar was a better investment thus disposed of than in any other way; for on several occasions
he had eaten it with his hardtack a little at a time, had got it wet and melted in a rain, or what happened fully as often, had
sweetened his coffee to his taste when the sugar was kept separate, and in consequence had several messes of coffee to drink without 
sweetening, which was not to his taste. There was one and then a man who could keep the two separate, sometimes in different ends of the
same bag, and serve them up proportionally. The reader already knows that milk was a luxury in the army. It was a new experience for
for all soldier to drink coffee without milk, But they soon learned to make a virtue of necessity, and  I doubt whether one man in

<b>Coffee substitutes</b><br>
When real coffee was unavailable, a variety of alternative substitutes were employed. The final brew varied from borderline
acceptable to downright undrinkable. The best documented examples come from the American South during the
Civil War. Mary Elizabeth Massey's research is regularly referenced by contemporary authors. Every sentence is footnoted
back to the primary document. Comprehensive bibliography and excellent index are also offered. In Ms. Massey's own words:
<p>

"Beverages also were scarce in the Confederacy and coffee was the most sorely missed of them all. Certainly the shortage of no other 
beverage was responsible for such frequent complaint by contemporaries. One wrote that 'The coffee shortage caused more actual
discomfort among the people at large' than did any other. This commodity began to disappear before the summer of 1861 had passed, 
and it was rarely seen after the fall of the same year. When one woman had to give it up, she wrote that she lost her 
'elasticity of spirit.' Another cried 'Sour Grapes' to those who vowed that they did not miss the universal brew. But as one saw apple pies
without apples, one also found 'coffee' houses where no coffee was served. So dear did coffee become that the jewelers in 
Atlanta were reported to have bought all the coffee available 'for sets in breast pins instead of diamonds.' There were those,
however, who managed to have a little coffee from time to time. Some had hoarded a supply, and a small quantity continued to 
come through the blockade. Rhose who had coffee usually brewed a weak beverage and added other ingredients to make it go 
further. These blends might include parched corn, rye, wheat, okra seed or chicory, and the resutls were not always satisfactory. 
One diarist declared that such adulterated coffee was delicious, another thought it nauseating. Whenever the real product made
its appearance, it was the signal for unrepressed glee. Sometimes it was referred to as 'true-true' coffee, and one young lady, 
in recording the day's menu in her diary, underlined 'real coffee' twice. When a train carrying 'blockade' coffee was wrecked nar
Sumpter, South Carolina, the eager, thirsty, inhabitants of the area rushed to the scene of the wreck and took home sacks of the
real bean. One editor worte that 'more real coffee has been drunk in that neighborhood within a few days than for a long time. The civilian population attacked the problem of substitutes for coffee with a determination and energy unlike that exhibited in
the search for other expedients. No other single item had more substitutes. The people worked at the project unceasingly, with
the result that 'few were the substances which did not...find their way into a coffee pot.' Boundless was the pride of the housewife
 who discovered and put into use a substitute that would deceive her guests into thinking that they were drinking the real thing. 
Nearly all women had their own combinations, but usually they shared the secret with those who were interested. Among the most popular, and
apparently the most successful, of the substitutes was rye. This was boiled, dried, then ground like coffee. A mild debate was
carried on through the newspapers as to whether or not rye thus used was harmful to the body; regardless of the points made, 
people continued to use it. Another substitute frequently use was okra seed. More expensive and troublesome than rye, it was
nevertheless popular. Its proponents were convinced that it was by far the best substitute. The okra seeds were dried and parched in a similar
manner to rye. Corn, too, was used and prepared in a like manner, and there were thouse who preferred corn 'coffee' to any
other. The dashing General J.E.B. Stuart was reported to be of this group. Sweet potato 'coffee' was another of the more popular wartime
expedients. Potatoes were peeled and cut into 'chunks' about ths size of coffee berries. The pieces were spread out in the sun
to dry, then parched until brown, after which they were ground. The grounds were mixed with a little water until a paste resulted, after
which hot water was added. When the grounds settled to the bottom of the coffee pot, the beverage could be poured and drunk...Other coffee
substitutes were acorns, dandelion roots, sugar cane, parched rice, cotton seed, sourghum molasses, English peas, peanuts, wheat,
and beans."<br>

<b>Recipes & brewing notes</b><br>
"Coffee Substitutes: As substitutes for coffee, some use dry brown bread crusts, and roast them; other soak rye grain in rum, and
roast it; other roast peas in the same way as coffee. None of these are very good; and peas so used are considered 
unhealthy. Where there is a large family of apprentices and workmen, the coffee is very dear, it may be worth while to use the
substitutes, or to mix them half and with coffee; but, after all, the best economy is to go without. French coffee is so 
celebrated, that it may be worth while to tell how it is made; though no prudent housekeeper will make it, unless she has
boarders, who are willing to pay for expensive cooking. The coffee should be roasted more than is common with us; it should not hang
drying over the fire, but should be roasted quic; it should be ground soon after roasting, and used as soon as it is ground. Those
who pride themselves on first-rate coffee, burn it and grind it every morning. The powder should be placed in the coffee-pot in 
the proportions of an ounce to less than a pint of water. The water should be poured upon the coffee boiling hot. The coffee
should be kept at the  boiling point; but should not boil. Coffee made in this way must be made in a biggin. It should not be clear
in a common coffee-pot. A bit of fish-skin as big as a ninepiece, thrown into coffee while it is boiling, tends to make it
clear. If you  use it just as it comes from the salt-fish, it will be apt to give an unpleasant taste to the coffee: it should
be washed clean as a bit of cloth, and hung up till perfectly dry. The whites of eggs, and even egg shells are good to settle
coffee. Rind of salt pork is excellent. Some people think coffee is richer and clearer for having a bit of sweet butter, or a
whole egg, dropped in and stirred, just before it is done roasting, and ground up, shell and all, with the coffee. But these 
things are not economical, except on a farm, where butter and eggs are plenty. A half a gill of cold water, poured in after you 
take your coffee-pot off the fire, will usually settle the coffee. If you have not cream for coffee, it is a very great
improvement to boil your milk, and use it while hot.---<i>Amercian Frugal Housewife</i>, 1830."<br>

<b>Acorns</b><br>
"Acorn Coffee: Take sound a ripe acorns, peel off the shell or husk, divide the kernels, dry them gradually, and then roast them in 
a close vessel or roaster, keeping them continually stirring; in doing which special care must be taken that they be not burnt
or roasted too much, both which would be hurtful. Take of these roasted acorns ground like other coffee) half an ounce every
other morning and evening, alone mixed with a dram of other coffee, and sweetened with sugar, or with or without milk. This receipt
is recommended by a famous German physician, as a much esteemed, wholesome nourishing, strengthening nutriment for mankind;
which, by its medicinal qualities, had been found to cure slimy obstructions in the viscera, and to remove nervous complaints
when other medicines have failed. Remark: Since they duty was taken off, West India coffees is so cheap that substitutes are not 
worth making. On the continent the roasted roots of the wild chicory, a common weed, have been used with advantaged. ---Family

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>French 75 cocktail</b></a></font><br>
The classic formula for this early 20th century cocktail combines gin, champagne, powdered sugar and lemon. Named after the
popular quick-firing <a href="http://www.firstdivisionmuseum.org/museum/exhibits/tankpark/75mm.aspx">French 75</a> weapon used in 
World War I, this powerful beverage packs a punch. Like so many war-time cocktails, the origin is generally attributed to 
Harry's (Paris), a popular establishment with American soldiers. Our survey of historic mixology manuals and American newspapers
suggest the French 75 was a popular cocktail through the 1940s. It was not, however, a "standard" drink. Many bartender guides
published in this period omit it. In subsequent decades the French 75 enjoyed brief periods of nostalgic rediscovery. In 
2013 it is a popular choice for people exploring historic cocktails.

Harry's New York Bar, Paris, after the War and became known as the French 75. He added champagne to a short drink with a gin

The history of ginger ale (aka ginger beer) begins with small beer (low alcohol content). Recipes first surface in the early 19th
century. <a href="foodbeverages.html#rootbeer">Root
beer</a> shares a similar history. Using <a href="foodfaq1.html#ginger">ginger</a> as the primary flavoring agent, this 
product has long been recognized for settling upset stomachs. American commercial production began in 
the mid-1860s. As a cooking ingredient, ginger ale has been combined with gelatine to make molded salads and cake batter (cola cake style).
<p>
"Ginger ale--a carbonated beverage sweetened and flavored with the extract of ginger root...serves
as the transitional link between the home-brewed alcoholic small beers and small ales of old and
modern-day mass-produced soft drinks. Small beers had been prevalent for centuries as
affordable, if far less potent, alternatives to commercial alcoholic brews. Derived from almost
any part of almost any plant available in England and colonial America, small beers and ales
were generally presumed to be tonic in contrast to civic water supplies, which were believed to
be potentially toxic. Ginger beer, which peaked in popularity in the early nineteenth century, was
certainly considered to be healthy: Ginger's reputation as a counterirritant and digestive aid,
among other things, was firmly entrenched in folk medicine...Though the precise circumstances
of its invention remain unknown, ginger ale, also called ginger champagne or gingerade, achieved
immediate fame throughout the British Isles and overseas as a product of Belfast..."<br>

days, during which it may be stirred six or eight times; then put it into a cask, which must be kept full, and the yeast taken off at the bung-hole

The ale is more brilliant of the syrup is used on the day it is made. To make a temporary filter, take a large tub, perfectly clean and 
sweet, having a faucet at the bottom; over the top of the top stretch a clean, wet, cotton cloth, firmly secured in position by a 
cord around the outside of the tub; press the cloth down in the center firmly with the hand, and lay on it a large No. 80 size filter
paper. With a long-handled dipper or ladle pour the mixture on the center of the filter until it is full. Draw from the tub the
first run, and if not clear, return it to the mixture, and again pass through the filter. The filter when set can be used for several 
lots. The filter gub should be scalded after use to keep it sweet. Tin-lined copper tanks are preferable to tubs for mixing and
filtering. Acid and color must not be added until after filtering. The best way is to use color is to mix a pint of color and a pint of hot
water, and filter. Use one-fourth ounce to the gallon. Fruit acide is made as follows: Citric acid....4 ounces, Boiling water....
8 ounces. Dissolve thoroughly, and strain through a flanned cloth. Keep the acid solution will deteriorate if kept too long. The came
ginger ale does not suit all localities. To make the befeage stronger use more extract; if sweeter, use more sugar; if dryier, use more
acid. Stick to the method of manipulation. The quality depends to a great degree on the method.

Food historians generally agree Irish coffee, a warming composition of coffee, whiskey, sugar and heavy cream, 
is a 20th century libation. The credits are constant and documented: Shannon airport (first location), Joe Sheridan (chef inventor), Stan Delaplane (syndicated columnist credited
for making beverage popular in USA), and Buena Vista Cafe, San Francisco (signature drink). Simple as that? It could be. 
<p>
Examining American print in hopes of discovering  "the truth" behind Irish coffee is like sifting through another family's
 secret treasures. Articles chip uncomfortably at obscure shadows reconciling professional passion and human fortune. The real story
 behind Irish coffee may just be: If you're not careful, you'll get what you ask for. 
<p>
<b>[1942] </b><br>
<em>Dozens of articles published in USA newspapers chronicled American visitor experiences in Ireland. General concensus among USA coffee
afficianados: Irish attempts were seriously sub-par. No mention of whiskey or floating cream.</em><p>
"American soldiers in Ulster...profess a liking for the friendly people and the pretty girls, but find fault with the coffee and the 
beer. Whiskey is expensive and high-powered, the beer flat and less palatable than the American variety and the coffee weak. 
Most of the griping comes from the coffee addicts. It is by far the most popular drink among the expeditionists. Irish cooks, it seems, 
simply do not know how to make good coffee, a blind spot they share with most American cooks...Any good coffee hound, even at an 
airline distance of 4,500 miles, can tell you what's the matter with Irish coffee. it is weak, it tastes like an infusion of dishrags, 
and its original bouquet is lost amid the assorted smells which come from pots not properly aired and sunned...But poor coffee 
isn't peculiar to the warmhearted Irish people. It is practically universal among all the races of mankind...We hope the coffee in Ulster doesn't 
drive our boys to harder stuff." <br>

<em>Irish aviation museum confirms Joe Sheridan's employment at Shannon Airport circa 1943. Text states Sheridan 
was recruited by Brendan O'Regan. Sheridan later recounts concocting Irish Coffee at Foyne's Flying Boat Basin (later renamed Shannon Airport) in 
1938. We wonder if Mr. O'Regan "recruited" Sheridan (to stay) because he knew a lucrative bartender when he saw one.</em><p>

"This restaurant had been considered to be one of 
the best restaurants in Ireland at that time. Chef Joe Sheridan, originally from Castlederg, County Tyrone, had been recruited by Brendan. When 
Joe was asked to prepare something warm for the passengers, he decided to put some good Irish Whiskey into their coffees. One of the 
passengers approached the Chef and thanked him for the wonderful coffee. He asked Joe did he use Brazilian Coffee? Joe jokingly answered, 
"No that was Irish Coffee!!"A few weeks later, Chef Sheridan knocked on Brendan O'Regan's office door. He showed Brendan this new drink in a 
stemmed glass and asked him "How about that for eye appeal". Brendan answered "Genius Chef" and so began Irish Coffee. Irish Coffee continued
 to be served at Foynes to all passengers and is still served to this day to all dignitaries arriving at Shannon Airport." <br>

"You ever tried Irish coffee at 4 a.m. on a cold and rainy night in Shannon? You haven't lived. I'm rolling across Newfoundland at this 
writing on a TWA Constellation and I'm still smacking my lips of that astonishing nectar the Irish provided at their snug little 
airport a few hours and one ocean ago. The recipe is simple: You take a goblet with a long stem so you'll have something to hold on to. Into the bottom of it you 
sprinkle a teaspoon of sugar. On this you pour a jigger if Irish whisky. You stir it. Then you fill the glass to within a 
half inch of the top with strong, black coffee...On to this mixture, carefully so it won't mix, you ladle stiff 
sweet cream into the brim. That does it. Now you sip appreciatively and silently thank the Irish for inventing such a brew to warm 
the inner and and quell the terrors of the night. Something else cheered me in Shannon, too, something with red hair and jeweled 
blue eyes: one of the prettiest sights I ever saw. Our plane had soared up from Orly Airport in Paris earlier in the night, circled 
once around the Eiffel Tower, cut through the blackness over France and England, and eased down in Shannon with the propellers beating 
cascades of rain against the windows. We weary-eyed passenger stumbled down the aluminum steps to stretch our legs (we didn't know that 
we were about to learn the delights of Irish coffee;) and there she was. This colleen in the deep green uniform of her government, waiting 
to greet us. There were rain drops on her eyelashes, and, in the floodlights by the plane, they glistened like diamonds. We, who have 
just left the mascarred and rouged ladies of a Parisian hot spot, stopped and stared. I'm, afraid we weren't very polite. She 
laughed, shook the rain from here eyes ...and led us into the lounge by the fire where the waiters already had mixed the sugar and 
the whisky in the glasses and were poised with the coffee and the bowls of cream. Most of the big airliners these days give Shannon the 
old go-by. Only when they are heavily laden with passengers and plunder from the far corners of Europe do they put down in Ireland 
to fill the gas tanks for the hop access the Atlantic. This, I think, is too bad. Those passengers who skip Shannon miss one of the 
pleasantest interludes available anywhere to the traveler." <br>

<em>Stan Delaplane's legendary syndicated column "introducing" Irish coffee to the USA. When he wrote, people read. And he wrote often. Predictable St. Patrick's Day columns celebrating Irish 
coffee were supplemented with additional tidbits all year long.

"Irish coffee has become a nobel experiment in San Francisco these days. I claim a modest share in this since I ruined a bottle of the 
best John Powers trying to make the cream float. For some reason the cream floats beautifully in Dublin. But for me in the States 
it sinks. Irish coffee is compounded of hot coffee, sugar and Irish whiskey in a bell-shaped glass. On the top of this you float a 
half inch of chilled cream. One of them takes the chill off. Two of them set you to singing 'Down Went McGinty to the Bottom of 
the Sea.' I ran into it first at Shannon airport. I had spent the raw, rainy day in nearby Ennis with a sentimental American 
journalist with an Irish name. He was looking for relatives of his great-grandfather. And for some reason he sought them only in the 
Ennis pubs. I was extremely sore-footed. I had climbed into my first Irish bed. It was cold as Cromwell's heart at the top. And 
someone had tucked a blistering bottle of hot water at the bottom. I sat before the peat fire in the Old Ground with my shoes off. 
'What you need,' said the waiter, 'is a Gaelic coffee.' "Drink a health,' I said...Now the only reason I bring this up is because 
it us customary to speak well of the Irish this day. And I cannot speak any higher than of their coffee. It is smooth as nectar. 
The steaming fragrance rises through the collar of Irish country cream. I have had some strange experiences in the making. The 
trick is to make the cream float. 'You must have the coffee well-sugared,' a waiter told me in Dublin. Old Bailey in 
Duke street. He mixed his dollop of whiskey and two spoons of sugar and coffee up to an inch below the rim of the class. Then he 
laid a spoon bottom side up on top of the coffee and poured the cream slowly over that. In the Red Bank of Dublin, the waiter poured 
the cream from a little pitcher down the side the glass. I have tried both. Sometimes my cream floated. Sometimes it didn't. The 
oddest performance was at breakfast in Massachusetts. My cream floated wonderfully on the first batch. It and despairingly thereafter. 
I checked every possible angle. Finally we discovered the second pot of coffee had been made with an eggshell in it. We made new coffee 
without the eggshell and the cream rode the top again. No particular reason for all this. Except as I say it is the day of the Irish. 
And I have been considering the luck of the Irish. And come to the conclusion that the luckiest thing is that they have Irish coffee. It keeps 
the end of you warm that is not warmed in the Irish beds. The middle then takes care of itself." <br>

all Irish menus. It spread to San Francisco, to the Hotel Sherman in Chicago, to the Mapes in Reno...'Now I invented it in the old 
days when the flyin' boats were coming to Foynes in Ireland. They were havin' a celebration like for the new lines and they wanted a drink with 
a warm glow to it. There's some say that I put the whisky in it to take away the taste of the horrible Irish coffee. But that's 
not true.. It is a drink I took myself every morning for my hangover. I put a little whisky in the coffee. I don't drink now...for it became bad 
for the health and I couldn't do it financially. As a matter of fact I'm a member of the AA, a back-sliding one in a way. For sometimes 
I've gone for a good one and worked by way from the elegant Hotel St. Francis down to Skid Road and back again. I brought 
my friend from the St. Francis down to Skid Road...but the St. Francis objected when I brought my friends from Skid Road up to the 
St. Francis. Mr. Joe Sheridan is a chef. He has been chef at Shannon and at Waikiki and presently at Place Pigalle in San 
Francisco...'Now I've kept under cover while the Irish coffee thing was beginning in the United States...until I could see which 
way the wind blows. I'm in hopes that it will go through the hotels down to the bars.'...I asked Mr. Sheridan if he had a preference in 
Irish whisky for the makings. 'In the old days I used John Powers or John Jamieson's. it was served in the best hotels in 
Ireland and was drunk by the elite of Ireland. now in those days, William of Tullamore was a small concern and was not used by 
the high class people. The O'Regans would never dream of it. But now I see Tullamore Dew has gone all out and captured the export 
trade in many places.'...I asked Mr. Sheridan how much sugar he put in the coffee-and-whisky. 'Two lumps, cocktail size...When 
I made it for myself for the hangover, I drank it black. But with all the vice presidents and the big people comin' to Foynes for 
the celebrations, I floated the cream on top for the taste and the looks of it. I called it Gaelic coffee. But here in America it 
would be alright to call it Irish coffee. It being an Irish drink, invented by an Irishman and served in Ireland." <br>

"On a chilly fall day at Shannon Airport five years ago, San Francisco Chronicle Columnist Stan ('Postcards') Delaplane stepped up to a bar for a bracer. From the other side, 
he was handed a drink he had never tasted before . Delaplane inquired and got--complete with an Irishman's flair for a tale--Bartender Joe Sheridan's explanation of the 
origin of the drink. Back in San Francisco Columnist Delaplane remembered the drink and the story. In his column, he wrote: 'Twas in the old days the flying boats were
 landing at Foynes--about '38 I should say: the passengers would come in by launch, shivering and shaking for to die with cold. 'Surely,' said Joe Sheidan, 'we must invent 
a stirrup cup for the poor souls and them not able to pub their shivering hands in their pockets for a shilling to pay unless we warm them. What is more 'warming,' said 
Joe, 'thank Irish whisky, smooth as a maiden's kiss? To take the chill off their poor shaking hands we will fill the glass with coffee black as Cromwell's heart. We will top it
 with a floating inch of Irish cream.' The result: Irish coffee. The memory of the drink was not enough for Columnist Delaplane. One night at San Francisco's Buena Vista 
bar, he showed the bartender how to make Irish coffee. The drink that Columnist Delaplane mixed (and reported in his column), packed a wallop felt far from San 
Francisco. A few weeks after Delaplane's demonstration came a startled cable from Ireland to a San Francisco liquor importer: What;s Happening? The answer: Delaplane
 had touched off a craze for Irish coffee. In San Francisco's Buena Vista bar alone, consumption of Irish whisky leaped from two cases a year to 1,000 cases, an average
 of 700 Irish coffees a day. Visitors from some 40-odd cities where Delaplane's columns turned up in droves to sample the magic dew. The consumption of Irish coffee 
has become to great that exports of Irish whisky to the U.S. increased 40% last year, to 10,000 cases. In Manhattan, bistro from Pat Moriarity's Chop House (price: 85 
cents) to the 21 Club ([price $1.75) have begun ladling out Irish coffee. TV Star Jack Webb built an entire Dragnet around Irish Coffee...This fall the flabbergasted Irish 
whisky industry begins a campaign to put Irish coffee on the menus of bars and restaurants all over the U.S. But the men who introduced the drink to America, Bartender
 Joe Sheridan and Columnist Stan Delaplane, will not be part of the campaign. Joe Sheridan, who left Ireland and drifted to Canada, Hawaii and finally by sheer coincidence,
 to San Francisco, cannot stand to even look at the drink any more. Instead of taking a place of honor he has been offered behind the bar at the Buena Vista, he works as
 a cook in Tiny's Waffle Shop, an all-night restaurant near San Francisco's Union Square. 'Whisky and me, 'tis the sad truth,' he says, 'do not get along, whether it be in 
coffee or not.' As for Stan Delaplane, he avoids Irish whisky even straight (as it should be drunk), and will have not truck with Irish coffee. Says he: 'I can't stand the stuff 
any more.' Recipe: preheat a six-ounce glass with very hot water. Empty and refill the glass there-fourths full of hot, black, strong coffee. Add three cubes of sugar and 
stir until dissolved. Add a full jigger if Irish whisky and float whipped cream on top." <br>

<em>The first of several "the truth about Irish coffee" investigations. </em><p>
"Irish Coffee was evolved late in the 1930s at Shannon Airport by the head chef, a Gael named Joe Sheridan. And America 
provided an assist. The drink was inspired by a group of tourists from this country who arrived at the airport on a cold, 
wintry night in dire need of stimulant. Their plan had been delayed and they were weary and wet. The waiter became confused by the 
several orders if it coffee and hot toddies, Sheridan rose nobly to the occasion. In a burst of enthusiasm and inventiveness he 
combined a jigger of Irish whiskey, sugar, hot black coffee and whipped cream, all in preheated glass. Anyone who has seen or sampled the 
Irish Coffee knows the cream must be poured gently to form a white collar above the black base. Of course, uninspired bartenders in 
this country can, and do, employee whipped whip cream, but Sheridan used the fresh variety...It is only fair to San Francisco 
to explain Irish Coffee, although not originating there, was given a boost by the writings of a transbay travel columnist 
who we'll call Stan Delaplane. He sampled the nectar at Shannon and wrote about it. Word spread through California, across the 
Rockies and eventually to New York. Now Irish Coffee is as well-known in our country as the martini...Perhaps readers of this piece will 
image I exhumed these enlightening facts during an extended stay in Ireland last year. Journalistic integrity insists credit be given

you'd better set them straight...For you must remember you asked me for a warm drink for the passengers when the old flying boats 
used to come into Shannon.' 'And that's true, said O'Regan, 'and I did remember. But I didn't say so. For some other people in 
Ireland were claiming it. And it looked like I would be blowing my own horn too much since I'm still running Shannon Airport. And 
now that Joe Sheridan is gone, It's a thing I regret not doing.' That was a few weeks ago. So off today to the Buena Vista Cafe on 
San Francisco's waterfront. It made Irish coffee famous. And by it became famous itself all over the world...The coffee (Irish whisky 
and coffee topped with a collar of cream) has spread to places you wouldn't believe. They serve Irish coffee in the Parisian Grill 
in Hong Kong...Joe Sheridan kept a clipping of mine. It said flatly that he invented the heart-warming drink. He kept it in his 
foxy pocket. Which shows how much store he put by it (Seamen sew a hidden pocket in their clothes--they foxy pocket). 'This is the 
proof of it,' Joe told me. I don't know why some of the Dublin people said it was somebody else invented Irish coffee. I guess when 
something becomes famous, a crowd of people rise up to take credit for it,' said O'Regan...Joe Sheridan didn't die in Ireland. 
He went to sea. Sailed out of here through the Golden Gate and never came back. He died in some Far East Port, a lonely seaman's 
death. It was his heart, I think. I can't even remember the city where he was buried." <br>

<em>Toward the end of his life, Delaplane shares his personal cup of nostalgia with a hit of wisdom.</em><p>
"Irish coffee...was first introduced in America by Stanton Delaplane, the Pulitzer Prize winning columnist for the <i>San 
Francisco Chronicle</i>. Although Delapane did not win the prize for his introduction, it should be, nonetheless, a grateful nation that 
raises its mug on St. Paddy's Day...'To Delaplane.' 'It was invented back in 1945, or '48, by a bartender at 
Shannon Airport whose name was Joe Sheridan,' Delaplane recently recalled. 'The first time I had it was about 1950. I was with Earl 
Wilson and a bunch of guys, and we got into Shannon at about 5 on a real rosy Irish morning. 'We'd blown an engine--it was pretty 
standard back then to blow an engine going over the Atlantic--so we had to stay over. At that time Shannon was a very small airport. 
There were no big shops, no hotel. Nothing. There were a couple of Quonset huts that we stayed in, and that's how I got into Irish 
coffee; there was nothing else to do. 'When I came back to San Francisco, I went down to the Buena Vista, a little bar on the 
waterfront frequented by newspapermen. The place as doing so badly back then there were only about three guys in the place. 
We decided to work out the recipe for Irish coffee. 'Our first attempts...were so bad we couldn't even get the cream to 
float. Anyway, one of the guys there was a guy who would drink anything. We'd mix one up, hate it, and sent it on down to him... 
and he'd drink it. They were kinda milky-looking things and terrible. We kept on trying...and that guy just got drunker and 
drinker. The problem was the cream. Irish cream is much heavier than American cream. 'The viscosity--the surface tension--holds 
up the cream,' Delaplane reveals. 'When you hae think cream to start with, and you add sugar to the coffee, well, it's 
difficult. The solution was eventually discovered, and is still used at the Buena Vista. The cream is aerated for a second or two 
in a blender before it is oured over the back of a spoon into the coffee, where it then flats. Irish coffee turned the 
Buena Vista around, according to Delaplane, and made its reputation. The establishment, adjacent to the cable care turn-around 
at Fisherman's Warf, is immensley successful; 36 1-quart bottles of Irish whiskey have been poured every single day for the 
last 20 years. Delaplane feels 'very little remorse' about frayning the American moral fiber with his Irish coffee. He is, in fact, 
somewhat proud. 'They put up a bronze plaque outside the Buena Vista in my honor...I don't drink Irish coffee much over here. I 
drink it sometimes when I'm in Ireland as a kind of gesture or a vote of confidence; getting it now is different. I don't get the 
same feeling I used to get back then. It's like a time that was baked in my life, like your first date...It was like a time and a 
place that were just right for me. Life was a little more adventurous back then. What you need to do...is fly all night from Newfoundland 
in a propeller-driven airplane. We flew so low we could see icebergs, and we'd get into Shannon at 5 o'clock on one of those 
wonderful Irish monrnings. There was snow on the runway and it was bitterly cold. The we'd take the Irish coffee, and it was great. 
I'll never do that again,' Delaplane says with a sad fondness... <br>

<em>Bert Greene's "truth about Irish coffee" echoes <a href="foodbeverages.html#irish1964">Ward's investigation</a> published 20 years prior. Variables on the 
"truth about" Irish coffee theme include (1) year: late 1930s, 1938, 1942, 1945, 1948, 1949 (2) place: Foyne's Flying Boat Basin, Shannon Airport 
(same establishment, known by different names in different years, like Idelwild and JFK) (3) time of day: always dark (sometimes predawn other times

"One of the recent calls I received came from Ireland...Eugene McSweeney, chef-owner of Lacken House in Kilkenny called. McSweeney telephoned 
recently with only the slighted degree of ire, to set the record straight on Irish Coffee. It seems that many American food writers 
have been perpetuating the rumor (like Chinese chop suey and French tast) Irish Coffee was actually invented in the United 
States. The place of origin supposedly is the bar of the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco. Not so, claims McSweeney with a 
sheaf of historical documentation to prove the drink's actual source. Since Irish Coffee is certainly a favored libation from coast 
to coast, it seemed high time to get the facts nailed down, so I did. And pried a recipe for the spirited drink from McSweeney 
in passing. According to McSweeny, Irish Coffee was the invention of bar man Joe Sheridan who tended the pub at Shannon 
Airport in 1949 when it was known as Foyne's Flying Boat Basin. As the story goes, one morning when the clipper was overdue from 
America, passengers were so cold that they begged him for a quick hot toddy to revive their flagging spirits. Being a creative 
fellow, he whipped up a drink of what he had on hand: fresh brewed coffee, brown sugar and Irish whiskey. He floated some whipping 
cream on top. The rest is history, and there is even a plaque commemorating Sheridan's stirring arm at Shannon Airport." <br>

"Stanton Delaplane, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> and a world traveler with 
popularizing Irish Coffee in the United States, died in San Francisco on Monday at the age of 80...Delaplane, who spent about half 
the year overseas to create his six-day-a-week columns, joined the <i>Chronicle</i> in 1938 as a reporter. He became a syndicated 
columnist when a series of 'Postcards' he went back from a trip were collected and published. His subjects ranged from unusual people 
to those he knew best, his family and friends...Delaplane's connection to Irish coffee is part of San Francisco history. After 
sampling the libation at Shannon Airport, he returned to America and spent a long evening studiously working out the proper balance 
of whiskey, coffee, sugar and cream at the Buena Vista Cafe near the food to Hyde Street. Overnight, Jack Koeppler, the late owner 
of the bar, found himself overrun with patrons and the drink's popularity spread rapidly. Later, Delaplane was quoted in Time 
magazine as saying , 'I can't stand the stuff anymore.'" <br>

Lemonade is
(along with several other popular food innovations) sometimes touted as having been
"introduced" at the St. Louis Exposition in 1904. This is not true. 
Food historian Clifford A. Wright confirms the <a href="http://www.cliffordawright.com/history/lemonade.html">
earliest lemonades</a> originated in the Mediterranean region. Indigenous lemons were valued for their medicinal as well
as flavorful properties.
Lemonade was introduced to America by European settlers in the 17th century. Economics of the <a

 century.

<b>About modern lemonade</b>
<p>
"From its simple seventeenth-century beginnings as a drink made from lemon juice and water,
usually with sugar, lemonade has diverisfied widely...The term is an adapation of French
limonade, a derivative of limon...It was the first example in English of a word for a fruit drink
ending in -ade (orangeade followed in the eighteenth century), but it was not really until the late
nineteenth century that the suffix took on a life of its own with new formations such as cherryade,
gingerade, and limeade."<br>

<p>
"Lemonade, which in its simplest form is a drink made with lemon juice, sugar, and water, has a
history dating back at least to the thirteenth century, when Arab cookery books offered recipes
for drinks made from lemon syrup. The Mongols enjoyed a sweetened lemon drink preserved with
alcohol, and the Persians enjoyed sharbia, from which English "sherbet" derives. By the
mid-seventeeeth century the drink was popular in Europe when limoadiers, street vendors in
France,
sold lemonade at modest prices. A lemonade recipe appeares in the 1653 English translation of La
Varenne's <i>The French Cook</i>. Lemonade arrived in America no later than the eighteenth
century,
imported from the various European cultures of immigrants...lemonade's image underwent a
transformation engendered by the temperance movement, which turned lemonade into a genteel
Victorian drink...Modern technology also helped the juice flow...Lemonade's popularity rose
unabated, prompting the 1901 <i>New Orleans Times-Picayune's Creole Cook Book</i> to
proclaim, "Lemonade is among the most delightful and most commonly used of all Fruit Waters."
Lemonade was also considered a tonic, served to those suffering from colds...or to invalids."<br>

<b>Grocer's notes, circa 1883:</b><br>
"Lemonade. A beverage made from the juice of the lemon, for the purpose of allaying thirst. It is also used for medicinal purposes, when it is made either hot or 
cold, according to the complaint. The vendors of lemonade use citric or tartaric acid, or even a few drops of sulfuric acid, to make their mixture, and only slice a 
 few lemons to float on the surface and please the eye. Most of the lemonade powders declared to be pure, are made in a similar way. Reliable brands of lime-juice
 are preferable, unless the fresh fruit is at hand."<br>

The story of orange juice begins with <a href="foodfaq2.html#oranges">oranges</a>. Food historians tell us citrus fruits originated in
Asia thousands of years ago. They were introduced to America as part of the Columbian
Exchange.

Early cooks valued oranges for their zesty flavor and health properties. English and American
cookbooks from early times through the 19th century contain many recipes with oranges. Some
of
these are flavored with oranges (orange cheesecake, orange foole, orange snow, orange
Charlotte, orange sherbet); others feature oranges as the primary ingredient (orange marmelade,
orange compote, fresh fruit salad with oranges). Perhaps the earliest recipes for orange juice
(besides the "just squeeze it!) "orangeade," or "orange water." These combined orange
juice/extract with a sweetener. According to the old cookbooks, this drink was served both as a
refreshment and to the sick. <a href="foodbeverages.html#lemonade">Lemonade</a> shares a similar history. 
<a href="foodbeverages.html#tomatojuice">Tomato juice</a> was also considered a restorative during the early 20th century.
<p>
Orange juice, as we Americans know it today, is a relatively modern item. Before mass
production and refrigerated transportation, few people enjoyed orange juice as a regular part of
their diet. In the United States, health food advocates and nutritionists promoted orange juice in
the 1920s. Commercial operations began selling <a href="foodbeverages.html#frozenorangejuice">frozen orange juice</a> to the public just after

Our research confirms Minute Maid brand orange juice concentrate was developed by Vacuum Foods Corporation in 1945. 
Originally created for the U.S. Army, the product was
 introduced to the American public April 30, 1946. The company changed its name to Minute Maid in 1949. In the summer of 
1949, Minute Maid ran a major ad campaign in major popular magazines/newspapers. 
<p>
"Minute Maid brand of orange juice is the category brand leader in the United States with a well-differentiated line of frozen concentrate and chilled 
varieties. Minute Maid has been offering consumers...frozen concentrated orange juice since 1946...Minute Maid was the first orange juice brand 
developed as a frozen concentrate. In 1946 John M. Fox, the brand founder, initially marketed the concentrate through door-to-door 
salesmen in Massachusetts. Fox founded Florida Foods, Inc. in 1945. Within a year, the company name was changed to the Vacuum Foods 
Corporation. Vacuum Foods was affiliated with the National Research Corporation which had developed a high-vacuum evaporation process 
that eliminated 80 percent of the water to reduce orange juice to a concentrate while retaining the full flavor. Ultimately, 
the concentrate was frozen and successfully marketed as a convenient product available year round...Early marketing stressed 
the superior taste of Minute Maid's frozen concentrate as opposed to canned orange juice, as well as its convenience compared to 
squeezing fresh oranges. Minute Maid's name had ben created to focus customer's attention on how quickly the product could be transformed 
into orange juice. Early advertising emphasized Minute Maid's time savings, claiming the product saved a full five minutes in 
preparation time. The 1948 launch of the Bing Crosby radio campaign boosted early sales dramatically...a label with a black background was 
adopted in 1964. At that time it was extremely uncommon to associate the color black with food products." <br>

"Frozen orange juice concentrate is the 'hot' item in the food industry at the moment. John M. Fox, president of Vacuum Foods Corp. told 
stockholders at the annual meeting. The company, a pioneer in the field, is producing and marketing its produce under the Minute 
Maid trade name. Mr. Fox stated that while the outlook is excellent, the business is very competitive. He said Birdseye division

Sno Crop Marketeers is also going out aggressively for the business. 'A battle of the brands' as the companies fight for the

<b>Pink Lemonade</b><br>
The origins of pink lemonade is a curious thing. Legendary concensus credits Henry E. Allott, a circus vendor, for accidentally inventing this drink. Our survey of 
American newspapers and cookbooks reveals several period references for coloring lemonade with pink or red fruit. Most notably watermelon, raspberries, 
cherries, currants, and strawberries. Which came first? It's hard to say. 
<p>
Newspaper articles reporting Mr. Allott's death (1912) mention he invented the drink when he was 14 of 15. They do not, however, reveal his birth year or tell us 
how old he was when he died. Federal census records list two Henry Allotts. By process of elmination, our Henry was born in Wisconsin, 1858. He was 54 when
 he died in 1912. That would place his invention around 1872-1873.
<p>
<b>The "legend"</b><br>
"Henry E. Allott, known all through the Middle West as 'Bunk' Allen, member of the old Chicago gambling syndicate, saloonkeeper, theatrical promoter, circus 
man, and inventor of pink lemonade, died here today. At 15 he ran away with the circus and obtained a lemonade concession. One day while mixing a tub full of the
 orthodox yellow kind he dropped some red cinnamon candi                                es in by mistake. The resulting rose-tinted mixture sold so surprisingly well that he continuted to 
dispense his chance discovery."<br>
---"Inventor of Pink Lemonade Dead," <i>New York Times</i>, September 18, 1912 (p. 11)
<p>
"The man who invented pink lemonade crossed over the river last week and now rests with the departed souls...He was Henry E. Allott, a circus man, who was
 brought up in the Middle West--of course he was a circus man, for pink lemonade and the circus were as closely linked, say, as galluses and overalls. But Allott,
 besides being a child of the three-ringed tent and the animal side show, was a child of Fortune, too. For the discovery of the dink which gave him fame was sheer
 accident--perhaps it was...Fortune's wings that brushed the cinnamon red candies off the box into Allott's tub of lemonade and changed the color to a
 flowing pink--and pink lemonade had arrived. This is just how it happened. Allott was 14 years old at the time, and running the candy and lemonade "concession,"
 following a circus around the country...After the cinnamon candies had accidentally dropped in and suffused the lemonade on the instance we are speaking of, the
 new drink sold better than the old, and it was plain to Henry Allott that if the people who attended circuses had not been crying in divine high Pehlevi for lemonade, 
red lemonade, they had, in their own language, been hankering for it. Tub after tub was emptied, while the old yellow drink remained untouched. Thereafter the
 circus marked pink lemonade for its own...And the pink lemonade was there...It was there just as sure as the lady bareback rider came in gracefully balancing herself
 on her toes on the back of a white Chippendale horse...In your pocket you had 10 cents or maybe a quarter. Soon the men in red coats come up the aisles with the
 baskets of popcorn done up in red and blue and white oiled paper, with a prize in each, and peanuts, and--pink lemonade in glasses set in trays, with a straw in
 each and a piece of lemon floating on top--they myrmidons of Henry Allott... 25 years ago every boy and man...would have said that if pink lemonade went the
 circus must fall with it...It is a comfort to observe how sternly this institution kept to its early traditions; and never lost its colors even in its battle with the hosts of 
the pure-food forces. Pink it was when the cinnamon drops of Henry Allott first dissolved themselves in the wassail bowl he was mixing, and pink it remained--
faded, perhaps, in the once-cent-a-glass grade which Allott never knew--but still a tint of the original color. And it would have been easy for an innovator in this age
 of change, you might think, to have mixed his wares with a little copperas, or carbide, or paris green, or whatever it is that one person says makes a food product 
one color and another fellow says it doesn't--easy, you would think, to put green lemonade on the market, or purple, and wean a portion of the public away from 
the original brand...But not, Pink it remained, ranging in the better grades to red...But the people, as a whole, which is the only way to speak of the pink-lemonade-
drinking public, kept to their first love, and there has been much quiet satisfaction on this score among those who otherwise might have been prone to see in this 
country a tendency to lapse from the older thinking which have made the nation stable, even though times of unrest--times when pink lemonade itself might not have
 brooked the assaults against its bastions."<br>

Mixed drinks combining alcohol and other ingredients have been served from ancient times forward. Think: <a href="foodbeverages.html#punch">Punch</a>.
Cocktails appear to be the modern refined answer to the original mixed drink. Careful, calculated, scientific & classy.
Cocktails first surface in the early 19th century. Recipes evolved. Origination stories are understandably fuzzy and 
amazingly prolific. Our favorite <a href="foodbeverages.html#marylandcocktail">"first cocktail"</a> story features a duel and makes this a 
morning drink. <a href="foodfaq7.html#cocktail">Cocktail parties</a> soon followed. <a href="foodbeverages.html#happyhour">Happy Hour</a>
surfaces about the same time but not for the reasons we expect. How much did cocktails cost during <a href="foodfaq5.html#prohibition">Prohibition</a>?
<p>
<b>How did the cocktail get its name?</b><br>
"The word 'cock-tail,' describing a drink, first appeared in print in 1803. Several sources place its origins in the late
eighteenth century. New York author and historian Washington Irving wrote in 1809 that this class of beverages had originated in 
<a href="foodbeverages.html#marylandcocktail">Maryland</a>, whose inhabitants 'were prone to make merry and get fuddled with mint-julep and apple-toddy.'...New York State novelist
James Fenimore Cooper attributed the invention of the 'cock-tail' to one Elizabeth 'Betty' Flanagan, a war widow who lived on the road from 
Sleepy Hollow...at the time of the American War...In his novel <i>The Spy</i> (1821), Cooper makes the real Flanagan a colorful character...
Many other tales have been offered as how the the cocktail acquired its name. The only common thread among them was that it was an American
invention. Recipes for cocktails appeared in print starting in the early nineteenth century, although there were different views on the meaning of 
the word. The first definition appeared in 1806, when the editor of a New York magazine, <i>The Balance</i>, defined the cocktail as 
'a stimulating liquor, composed of spirits of any kind, sugar, water, and bitters.'"<br>
---<i>Drinking History</i>, Andrew F. Smith [Columbia University Press:New York] 2013(p.128-129)
<p> 
"Cocktail. There are well over 50 theories as to the word <i>cocktail's</i> origin, H.L. Mencken alone presenting seven plausible ones in his <i>American Language</i>. These include a derivation from the French <io>coquetier</i>, 'and egg cup,' in which the drink was supposedly first served in 1800; from <i>coquetel</i>, 'a mixed drink of the French Revolution period'; from <i>cocktailings</i>, 'the last of several liquors mixed together'; and from a toast to that cock that after a cockfight had the most feathers left on its tail. Just as reliable as any of these guesses is the old folktale that Aztec King Axolotl VIII's daughter Octel or Xochitl concocted the first cocktail; or, in another version, that an Aztec noble sent is emperor a drink made of cactus juice by his daughter, the emperor enjoying it so much that he married the girl and called the drink by her name--again Octel or Xochitl. According to this story, General Scott's soldiers are supposed to have brought the drink back to America centuries later. Suffice it to say that the origin of the word, first printed in 1806, is really unknown."<br> 
---<i>Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins</i>, Robert Hendrickson, 3rd edition [Facts on File:New York] 2004 (p. 162) 
<p>
"The etymology of <i>cocktail</i> has long engaged the learned, but without persuasive result. It is thus set forth by William Henry Nugent in Cock Fighting Today, <i>American Mercury,</i> May 1929, p. 80: 'Feeding is an important thing in the process [of conditioning game-cocks]. The old-time English and Irish trainers made a specially prepared bread of flour and stale beer or ale. They also added white wine or sack, gin, whiskey or other spirits, and a whole <i>materia medica</i> of seeds, plants, roots, barks, and leaves. In sampling this concoction before pouring it into the dough they found it an appetizing tonic, not only for pit flow, but also for man. They named it <i>cock-bread ale</i> or <i>cock ale</i>, and in the spelling of the time it became <i>cock ail</i>. Americans knew a variant of this beverage, as early as 1900, ad the <i>cocktail</i>, Somehow a <i>t</i> had got into the mixture.'

<p>
"Sir Edward's [McCubbin] treatise upon the cocktail (it was privately printed in a limited deluxe edition and I have, I believe, the only copy in America) deals at great length with the origin of the name. He says that it was first applied to a drink in the middle of the eighteenth century. The first drink to bear it was a diabolic sort of concoction of beer and brandy much affected by the officers of the Second Regiment of Royal Sussex Fusiliers, in the British Army. The men of this regiment, because they wore plumes resembling rooster feathers in their caps, were commonly called 'the cocktails' by the men of other regiments. The new drink, when it began to attain fame, took the name. No doubt much of this is true. I have seen several references to the Second Regiment's plumes in old newspapers of the period, and in at least one case the men are referred to as 'the cocktails.' But as for the rest of Sir Edward's story, there is no proof whatever. His book contains no bibliography, and he doesn't mention his authorities, and when I wrote him several years ago, asking for information, I received a reply from his secretary stating that, on account of the infirmities of age, it was impossible for him to discuss the matter."<br>
---"History of the Cocktail: Intellectual Bartender Recalls Duel That was Responsible<" <i>Washington Post</i>, December 20, 1908 (p. M2)
<p> 
"J.A. of New Orleans writes, 'I recall reading many years ago (but made no note of it) that the cocktail originated at an English 
function centuries ago when someone drank to a group of soldiers who wore cock tails in their hats. In giving the toast with a 
mixed drink he said, 'Here's to the cock tail.' Another theory, often quoted but regarded as dubious by some informed persons, is set 
forth in the book "Old New Orleans,' by Stanley Arthur (published by Harmanson). In 1793, a young Frenchman, A.A. Peychaud, and his 
sister Lauthenie fled to New Orleans to escape an uprising on the island of San Domingo. He established an apothecary shop at 
437 Royal St. Peychaud possessed a formula for making a remarkable tonic called 'bitters.' It was Peychaud's custom to serve the 
dram of cognac and bitters in one end of an old-fashioned double-ended eggcup. The French word for eggcup is 
'coquetier,' pronounced: kaw-kuh-TYAY,' The new drink soon became known as 'coquetier,' and the pronunciation was corrupted by 
non-French-speaking persons to 'cock-tay.' It is thought that, in the slurred speech of those who had drunk too many of M. Peychaud's 
coquetiers, the word became further corrupted to 'cocktail,' which, early in the 1800s, came to be accepted as the official name 
of the drink."<br>

The Hotel Roosevelt, which is introducing the Betsy Flanagan cocktail for the first time with the same ingredients the tavern proprietress used, is holding a Betsy Flanagan cocktail party at its bar today from four p.m. to closing.

<b>The first modern American cocktail?</b><br>
This account, circa 1908, flatly states the cocktail was created in Marlyand April 17, 1846. Details are stunning.
<p>
"'The cocktail,' said an intellectual Baltimore street bartender the other day, 'Is a distinctively American invention. True enough the name originated in England and 
was there applied to mixtures as early as the time of Dr. Johnson; but the true cocktail, as every patriotic American knows it to-day, was invented in the State of 
Maryland on April 17, 1846...'The great alcoholic statistician, and genealogist, Prof. Ferdinand Braun, of Halle, insists that the cocktail was invented in the Middle 
Ages by Wolfram von Spiegeleisen, the minnesinger, who is best known to fame as the discoverer of yodling. Braun devotes a whole chapter in his mammoth work 
'Die Alkoholismus,' to the demonstration of his theory, and quotes 100 forgotten books and manuscripts, but his argument for all that is ridiculous. 'As a matter of
 fact, whisky and gin were entirely unknown to the human race until toward the middle of the seventeenth century, and a cocktail without whisky or gin, as everyone 
knows, would not be a cocktail at all. 'On Braun's own showing the drink that Spiefelesen invented was a sort of cheap brandy punch, made of Bordeaux brandy, 
nutmeg and sugar. One might conceivably call this drink a flip, but it was in no sense a cocktail...'The Smithsonian Institution, in a somewhat elaborate report upon 
heavy drinking customs in the United States, says that the cocktail was invented in London in 1834 and introduced into this country, by way of New York, the year
 after. The University of Chicago, in a later work upon the same subject, repeats this error. 'That this is an error is shown by the diary of Herman Smith, published
 by the Falstaff Society in 1884. Smith was employed as head bartender at various New York hotels during the period 1832-1840, and later became 
superintendent of the wine cellars at Delmonico's. He kept an elaborate diary from 1832 to 1838, in which he noted down innumerable facts and happenings of
 interest to students of alcoholiania... In his book Dr Edward [McCubbin] admits freely that there is nothing in common between the cocktail of to-day and the 
horrible mess swallowed by the officers of the Second Fusiliers. 
<p>
"He seems to hold that the modern cocktail was invented was invented in 1836 by George Brooks, proprietor of the famous Brooks Club, in London. Again his 
authorities do not appear, and again, I doubt that he is true. As a matter of fact, Brooks was not a bartender at all, but a fishmonger, and his club was noted less for
its wet goods than for its gambling tables, through its wine cellar at one time was very extensive...Sir Edward says that when Brooks perfected the new drink he 
was at a loss for a name for it, and that 'cocktail' was suggested by Colonel William de Forrest, of the British Army, who had served in the Second Fusilliers years 
before and recalled the old brandy-and-beer cocktails. Colonel De Forrest, he says, as a celebrated bonvivant of the period, and spent much of this time at 
Brooks's Club. Chiefly as a matter of idle curiosity, I recently communicated with the British War Office regarding this Colonel De Forrest. What was my surprise to
learn that he was killed on July 18, 1831...This you will note, convicts Sir Edward of a serious error, for he says that De Forrest named the cocktail in 1836... 
Meanwhile, you are probably recalling my statement that the modern cocktail was invented in 1846, and wondering how I will prove it. Attacking the subject in the 
scientific manner, we find that it breaks up into definite questions, to-wit:<br>
1. When was the cocktail invented?<br>
2. By whom?<br>
3. Where?<br>
4. Who were present?<br>
5. Who drank the first cocktail?<br>
6. Who gave it its name?<br>
My answers to these questions are as follows, viz.:<br>
1. On the 17th of April, 1846, at 8:15 a.m.<br>
2. By John Welby Henderson, a native of North Carolina<br>
3. At the old Palo Alto Hotel, at Bladensburg, Md.<br>
4. Colonel William Mattingly, member of Congress from Geortia and Mssrs. John A. Hopkins, beside the aforesaid Henderson.<br>
5. John A, Hopkins, of Fairfax Va.<br>
6. I don't know.<br>
The story is an interesing one, and as it has come to me, bit by bit, out of the dim limbo of the past. It has entralled me like some medieval romance. Bladensurg, in 
those days, was a place of spirited combats and heavy dirnking. The old duelign grouns were still in use, and almost daily a party of gentelmen--members of 
Congress, diplomats or high officials--would come to settle some affair of honor...The party rode in two groups, oen of which contained seven and the other five. In 
the first tgroup were the Baron Henri de Vrie et Chellono, an attache of the French Legation; his fellow-diplomat, Chevalier Luitgi Lugno, representative of King of 
the Two Sisilies; Messrs. Jones, Lorrimore and Burton, members of the lower house of Congress, and Drs. John Maloen and Guilford Galloway of the Army 
Medical Corps. In the second group were Mr. Hopkins, Colonel Maglone and Messrs. Mattingly, Benson and Alison. As you have, no doubt suspected ere this it 
was a dueling party. Baron Challono and Mr. Hopkins were the principals and Chevalier Lugno and Colonel Maglone were their seconds. The cause of the 
different I have never learned, but it was a gentleman's fight and it was to be conducted in a gentlemanly manner. Shortly after 9 o'clock the 12 men reached the 
Palo Alto Hotel and there enjoyed an excellent supper. At 10 o'clock, after coutreous good-nights, they retired to their chambers. At daylight, next morning they 
were awake and ready for the journey to the dueling ground, a few hundred yards away. The chronicles are obscure as to what happened on the field, but I rather 
judge that Baron Challono was badly wounded. At any rate, he required the services of both surgeons for more than two hours, and the ground where he fell was 
drenched with blood. His courtly adversary, Mr. Hopkins, rushed to his side as soon as he fell. Mr. Hopkins, it appears, was a man of delicate perceptions in spite
of his intrepid daring, and the sight of the Baron's gushing blood made him ill. As a result, through he was not scratched himself, he staggered and seemed about to
faint. His second, Colonel Maglone, and the other gentleman rushed to his side atn took him off at once to the Palo Alto. Once there they conducted him to the old taproom and
called upon Jack Henderson who was on watch behind the bar, to set up something stimulating at once. Jack a manof resource, saw that something unusally tempting and powerul was
needed. Grabbing up a champagne glass he filled it half full of good old Maryland ryeand then seizing a bottle of bitters he heaved in a few drips. As he stirred up the mixture
of bottle of sirup caught is eye, and he pt in a swig. Then he pushed the mixture forward--and thie first Manhattan cocktail in the world was born. Mr. Hopkins seized the glass, poured down the 
liquor and at once recovered. Another! he dreied, enchanged. Jack made a second one with more care, and, seized by a hap[py thoguth, dropped a brandied cherry into it. 
Mr. Hopins gulped it down and then insisted that his friends try the new drink. They were charmed, as one might be expected, and when they sat down to breakfast a half an hour
after they were all in high, good humour. Colonel Magione, who was a celebrated connoisseur of wet goods, saw at once that the
moment had been an historic one, and soon after caused to be inserted in the old National Intelligencer, a newspaper of the day, and account of the new drink. He proposed that
it be called Royal Jack, in honor of Jack Hnderson, its inventor, but somehow the old name of cocktail became attached to it and the cocktail it as been ever since.
The generlemen who were actually present when the first cocktail was compounded and swallowed were Mr. Hopkins, Colonel Maglone, Mr. Benson and Mr. Allison, with 
Jack Henderson behind the bar. A few years later, after the new drink had attained world-wide repute, Colonel Maglone employed a Washington aretist named Tomothy
Pollard to make a darawing of the scene...The cocktail spread throughout the wold like some genial pestilence, and by 1850, four years after its invention, it was a vafoute dirnk
in all parts of the United States. It was known, too, in England, and Thackakeray mentioned it in 'The Newcomes; written in 1854. Two years before that our own Nathaniel
Hawthorne had immortailzed it in 'The Blithedale Romance.' Many other authors have referred to it in their works. Even Walter Pater, purist that he was, has given it a 
complimentary notice of a few lines. The late Lord Tennyson, it is said, left a manuscript sonnet to the cocktail, but his family deemed it inadvisable to include it in the definative
edition of his works. Kipling, Conan Dye, Zangwill and other later writers have referered to it often...Ibsen, as it is well known, drank four cocktails a day during the last 
30 years of his life, and ascribed his good health to their virtues. Tolstoi is generally supposed to be a teetotlar, but a recent biographer asserts that he frequently takes a 
Manhattan cocktail before dinner."<br>

Who introduced Happy Hour & when? Interesting question because, like most foods & meals, "Happy hour" was not invented. It
evolved. The term "Happy Hour" precedes the current USA definition (discount cocktails served in foodservice establishments 
for a designated period of time) by about 30 years. The US Navy designated Happy Hours in World War II. These were R&R periods which
may (or may not) have included alcoholic beverages. The nautical venue, presumably a continuation of practice from retired
sailors, prevailed in early accounts. Happy Hours surface after WWII, took hold in the 1950s and flourished in the 1960s. In the 1980s there
was major concern about the relationship between Happy Hours to drunk driving. Some states enacted laws prohibiting Happy Hour practices.
<p>
The earliest print reference we found for "Happy Hour" dates to 1907. It involves alcoholic beverages but was a solo event.
The term "Happy Hour" has also been use to name for restaurants, cafes, night clubs, theaters, aprons, canned foods, 
dance halls, newsies gatherings, high society social clubs and a poem. We have no clue if those patrons tippled during said
happy hour.

"Hobo Nelman is in jail, but he neither murmurs nor repines. Neither present restraint nor prospect of future punishment can take away form him the gorgeous memories of the 
halcyon hours that he spent in a box car at Imperial junction. Hobo Nelman blew in on a desert breeze in the night and sought a place to lay his frowzy head. He found it in a freight-car, but did not take advantage 
of it. Instead he gave his attention to boxes and cases. He went through these with skill, piling into a basket a dozen pairs of ladies shoes two dozen lovely kimonos, embroidered jackets and other feminine apparel and 
prepared to go on his way rejoicefully. But first he took another look around to make sure that he had not neglected his opportunities and just for luck, he broke 
open another case. Then he almost fainted, recalling how near he had been to making the mistake of his life. A bottle of Burgundy sluced the desert dust from his throat, and two more only 
stimulated his thirst. Half a dozen quarts of old California port a 'chaser' of apricot brandy (a quart) put him into just the right condition that completed the assortment in the 
case. When Detective Howler looked into the car, the case was empty, but Hobo Nelman obviously was not. He as arrived in a red kimono dotted with golden butterflies and as sleeping with his 
head pillowed upon a pack of plunder and with a champagne bottle lovingly to his heart. Now he is in jail, but a yet he is neither sober or sorry. A

excessive drinking...'There's been a move away from price-oriented happy hours,' said Stan Kyker, the executive vice president of the California

'Come in between 4 and 6 and enjoy our happy hour buffet.'' Kyker said the gradual change has not come about because of pressure from any
 governmental or legislative group, but is seen as 'a way to increase traffic. That's what happy hour is intended to do. It's not intended to
 increase the consumption of alcohol by individuals...There are no laws governing happy hour practices in California, and the last time such 
legislation was proposed, in 1985, it was defeated in committee...Such a law would not be unique in the United States. At least 14 other states,

Cordials, also known as cordial waters, were medicinal tonics concocted at home for "what ails you." Recipes vary, though most
are fruit flavored.
<p>
"Cordial. Whether adjective or noun, is derived from the Latin word for the heart, "cor." As a noun, it may mean a medicine, or 
medicinal food or drink, with the property of stimulating the heart and therefore the circulation. The term came also to mean a fruit
syrup or concentrated and sweetened fruit-based beverage, presumably because it was believed that a preparation of this sort would
have this effect. This sense of the word dates back to medieval times...Reference to cordials were far more frequent 100 eyars ago
than now, and the sense of the term far wider."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2nd edition, 2006 (p. 216)
<p>
"Cordials, sometimes referred to as liqueurs...are made from distilled spirits flavored with fruits, herbs, spices, or other botanicals;
they are sweetened with sugar, honey or other agents and diluted with wine, ater, or other liquids bearing less alcohol than
spirits. Coridal are one of the earliest forms of distilled beverages and frequently were used as medicines, since it was believed that
the curative properties of certain herbs could be preserved in spirits...Early cordials were used both as potable medicines and
as liquid ointments for bathing wounds."<br>

Unflavored, unsweeted, no-cal carbonated water products [soda water and tonic water] have been consumed from the earliest days
of soda fountains. Soda water and tonic water were generally mixed with other ingredients (sweet syrups, liqueurs, ice cream) for
flavor. These products were initially promoted as health drinks. Especially as alternatives to *demon* alcohol. By the 1880s,
sweentened carbonated beverages became a product in their own right. Think: Dr. Pepper and Coca Cola. 
 <p>
Artificially sweetened low-calorie carbonated beverages first surface in the 1950s. The earliest products were promoted to
diabetics and dieters searching for sugar-free alternatives. Kirsch introduced No-Cal 1952, selling the
product in selected NYC diet food stores. One year later, several major beverage 
companies penetrated the sugar-free carbonated drink market. By the early 1960s dozens of
 companies were competing for supermarket shelf-space. Coca Cola and Pepsi were not leaders, but followers. This new diet drink
was not embraced without challenge. Huge sales
and high public demand helped companies
overcome federal and state government regulations forbidding the use of artificial sweeteners in 
carbonated beverages. The reason behind the regulations are not addressed (protect the sugar industry? health concerns?). 
Diet sodas are challenged today for health reasons.
<p>
The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> reported the first results of the diet soda industry: "The collective summer thirst of Americans in all parts of the country is also boosting sales of some relative
newcomers to the carbonated market--quinine water, now used chiefly as a mixer for 'gin and tonic,' and low-calorie soft drinks, for people
who want to watch their waistlines. The latter drinks, sweetened with a chemical sugar-substitute, do not loom large in proportion 
to the total soda pop sales, but they're coming up fast, bottlers report. This year's low-calorie drink sales, nationally,
are expected to run between 6 and 12 million cases. 'That's a drop in the bucket, compared with the total soft drink market...
But then, a rise from nothing to 12 million cases, for a brand new type of product in one year, is something you can't laugh off.'"---

Records of the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov">US Patent & Trademark Office</a> confirm Kirsh No-Cal soft drink was 
introduced to the American public March 3, 1952. The earliest ad we find was published in the <i>New York Times</i> touted:
"No-Cal...Turning the town upside down! Absolutely non-fatteneng. Ginger Ale-Cola-Cream Soda-Black Cherry-Root Beer. Everybody's
wild about the lively taste of No-Cal. No-Cal means no calories, No trace of sugar whatsoever, All the flavor is in-all of the

"To Hyman Kirsch, Simferopol in Russia's Crimea seems no further from Brooklyn than No-Cal is from the soft drink syrups he compounded there before the turn of the 
century. No-Cal is a soft drink brand which is described as the fastest growing in its field...No-Cal is made in a half-dozen flavors, none of which contains sugar...Devising
No-Cal came from a kindly thought. When Hyman Kirsch came from Simferopol to Brooklyn in 1903 he prospered in the manufacture of ginger ale and soda opo. By the time
he became a vice president of the Jewish Sanitarium for Chronic Disease is on Morris had joined him in the business in 1923 and became later a director of the
sanitarium. Both of them were worried about the number of diabetics in the home who could find no sugar-free, non-alcoholic beverage. They got together in their own
laboratories with Dr. S.S. Epstein, their research man, and explored the field of synthetic sweeteners. Saccharin and other chemical sweeteners left a metallic aftertasted.
Then, from a commercial laboratory, they got cyclamate calcium, and No-Cal was accepted by the diabetic and those with cardio-vascular illnesses who could not
tolerate salts in the sanitarium. The drink was introduced modestly in the New York market, chiefly on dietict counters. But there were more sales than there were 
dieters.  A survey by Grey Advertising Agency, Inc., which has the account, revealed that only half the buyers of No-Cal were on a diet. So the campaign was aimed
at the girth-conscious men and women: the budget was quintupled...and No-Cal was off."<be>

"The so-called dietetick or nonfattening, drinks have sprung up in considerable numbers during the past year. They're marketed
primarily by their substitution of an artficial sweetener for sugar, and they're sold mostly in fruit flavors. Most brands are marketed

with more or less success for many years, today's types of dietetics first got rolling in New York and New England markets in

Beverages, Inc., Brooklyn N.Y., with its 'No-Cal',' and Cott Beverage Corp., New Haven Conn., with 'Cott Low Calorie

"The nation's calorie-counting citizens have suddenly seemed to capture the attention of the major soft drink producers. Both Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola this week 
have put two major new low-calorie soft drink products into test markets, and the other new products are in the offing. Pepsi-Cola Company is testing its new 
drink, Patio Diet Cola, in Greenville, S.C., and seems to be beaming its campaign mainly at the feminine market...If all goes well, Pepsi-Cola will move its new 
product into Philadelphia and Pennsauken, N.J., early in March for additional testing. Meanwhile, Pepsi's arch rival, Coca-Cola, has low calorie plans of its own. 
The company has started testing a sugarless soft drink called Tab in Springfield, Mass. Tab tastes very much like Coca-Cola, officials say, it contains only 2 calories
 in each 12-ounce bottle...J. Paul Austin, president of Coca-Cola, notes that low-calorie soft drinks have not as yet proved popular among the steady consumers 
of soft drinks. But, in his view, introduction of Tab might open the way to a new market that has not as yet been fully exploited by soft drink companies."

Which came fist iced tea or iced coffee?  Excellent question with two possible answers. Happy to elaborate. 
Iced tea/coffee, as we Americans know them today are cold, refreshing beverages. In this quaffable form, <a href="foodbeverages.html#icedtea">iced tea</a> precedes iced coffee. The phrase "iced coffee" precedes that of cousin tea by at least a decade. A closer examination of primary sources (cookbooks/newspapers) confirms the earliest references to "iced coffee" are for solid frosty confections similar to coffee ice cream or granita. So? The answer to this particular bar bet depends on whether you mean first print reference (iced coffee) or oldest evidence of the beverages we know them today (iced tea). Either way, the topic makes for some interesting conversation on a hot summer day. 
<p>
The earliest print references we find to "iced coffee" describe a granita or iced cream type product. The earliest USA reference we find for "iced coffee," meaning a
 cold beverage, is 1887.

Iced tea was mass marketed to the general public at the 1904 Exposition in St. Louis (as were
many other foods we now consider popular) but it was not invented there. Food history is full of
interesting stories when examined are not sometimes supported by documented evidence. Savvy readers know story
repetition/republishing doesn't make it true. But? Iced tea is mentioned in cook books, articles and traveler's diaries at
 least forty years before the
1904 Exposition.<p>
 Print evidence confirms this soothing beverage was prescribed in the mid-19th century for medicinal purposes. <a href="foodbeverages.html#icedteaweek">
Iced Tea Week</a> surfaces in the 1920s.
<p>
<b>Jist of the "traditional" 1904 claim:</b><br>
"In 1949, the <i>Post-Dispatch</i> [newspaper] announced the 45th anniversary of the invention of iced tea in 
St. Louis. When the Tea Bureau, Inc., in New York held its 1951 competition for "Miss Iced Tea," only St. Louis women could
enter the race. The Tea Bureau was affirming the story that the Fair was, indeed, the birthplace of iced tea. Here's how the
story, as it is recorded in a number of sources, unfolds: Richard Blechynden, the special commissioner from the India Tea
Association, was in the business of selling the traditional hot drink. During the hot summer of 1904, his hot tea was not exactly
in demand. So he seized the moment by sending his Singhalese waiters out with the and ice cubes in glasses--offering a 
refreshing
new drink. Hence, the beginning of 'iced' tea! Even the most liberal World's fair buff acknowledges that this story and the accolade
'new' attributed to this drink might be a bit exaggerated. Many suggest that Blechynden did not invent the drink, but 
'popularized' it, or, as some say now 're-invented' it."...Both hot and iced tea appeared on most menus at the Fair...It is 
highly unlikely that all these restaurants jumped on the bandwagon of Blechynden's 'new idea,' and scurried to the print shops
to have their menus reprinted!...Blechynden was hardly a desperate tea vendor! In fact, he was the highest-ranking 
representative from India and the director of the East India Pavilion...His waiters were not Singhalese (from Ceylon), but were
turbaned and bearded natives of India who were clad in white and who served their customers in balcony cafes rather than on
streets...Duane Sneddeker, director of library and archives for the Missouri Historical Society in St. Louis...believes, 
'It was during the post-WWII years, that St. Louisans were looking nostalgically at the 'good old days' and began lionizing some
of the stories told about the Fair.' This same time period came upon the heels of a popular 1944 movie, <i>Meet me in St.
Louis</i>, which so prominently featured the 1904 World's Fair."<br>

"Iced tea appeared in the United States, the creation of some anonymous individual, prior to the
Civil War. In 1860 a writer for Horace Greely's <i>Tribune</i>, Solon Robinson, published a
small
volume <i>How to Live</i>. In this appeared the sentence  Last summer we got in the habit of
taking the
tea iced, and really thought it better than when hot. By 1871 the new beverage competed with
iced milk, and iced water on hot summer days at the Fifth Avenue Hotel. In New York...By 1878,
travelers found iced tea for sale on the Rock Island Railroad and a  popular  beverage in Sidney,
Nebraska. Cookbooks began to offer recipes for iced tea and in 1886 Senators in their
Washington offices were said to have had large coolers of it to mitigate the force of the
weather.'"<br>

"Iced tea</b>. The tea that is to be used for the day's consumption should be made in the early
morning and in just the same way that it is made to be served hot. The quantity depends upon the
number of persons to be served, and in hot weather this might well be multiplied by three. The
best blend of tea for serving cold is equal parts orange Pekoe and English breakfast. This blend
does not lose strength in standing but ripens and softens in flavor. Tea must never be boiled. To
make it as it should be, take fresh cold water, bring quickly to the "bubbling" boil, and let it
continue several minutes. Scald out the teapot, which should be clean and dry, and measure into it
as many level teaspoonfuls tea as cups will be required. Pour the furiously boiling water over the
tea leaves and let steep on the back of the range four or five minutes, then strain off into a pitcher
to cool. When quite cold set in the ice box. By drawing the tea off the leaves when just the proper
strength it will be fresh and sweet, without the bitter taste of tannin it gets if allowed to stand too
long on the leaves. Keep the pitcher set close to the ice or pour the tea in bottles and lay directly
on the ice, thus offering more surface for cooling. When ready to serve, if the ice is above
suspicion, break into pieces about the size of horse chestnuts, put in the glasses and pour the tea
over them. If dependent upon the ordinary unsanitary ice, rinse the glasses out in cold water to
make them cold, then fill with the culled tea but no ice. Slices of lemon, a whole clove dripped in
each cup of tea as poured, a bit of pineapple, a sprig of mint or a peppermint cream are among the
popular additions to iced tea."<br>

"Ease rather than fine flavor sometimes seems to be the criterion of good cookery nowadays. 'How does it taste?' becomes secondary to  'Is it hard to prepare?' This interest 
in simplification results in all manner of manuaftured short cuts--some delicious as well as quick,; some just quick. Now comes a tea that dissolves in water, hot or 
cold, leaving no grounds. Speedier than ordinary tea or tea balls? Of course. And we can report that after tasting in The New York Times' test kitchen yesterday, that the 
flavor has not been sacrificed for an ease of use. Standard Brands, Inc., is introducing Instant Tender Leaf tea, as this perparation is called, in upstate New York. Then it
will take it to the south, then gradually work north...it is novel and interesting enough to be mentioned before it becomes available. That it apparently is considered to have
possibilities is shown by the fact that Nestle Company, Inc., maker of Nescafe, also has perfected an instant tea, called Nestea...Because powdered, soluble tea dissolves in 
water of any temperature, its convenience becomes most apparent in making iced tea. Here this is no need to boil the water first. Simply put a half-teaspoon of the 
product in a tall glass, half fill with cool water, stir, add ice to taste and serve."<br>

many customers--until he initiated pouring tea over ice in a glass. The concoction was a smash hit and iced tea's poularity here has been on the upgrade ever since. ...
Forty-five year's championship is warranted by the fact that iced tea is cool and easy to prepare, that it can be drunk in large quantities, that it is inexpensive and that it is a

The history of milk is a complicated and fascinating topic. Mother's milk has nurtured the human race from the dawn of 
time to present day. Generally, the emergence of milk as an 
industry traces back to the agricultural revolution, 10,000BC. Prehistoric hunter-gatherers captured
animals but did not domesticate them. Once people had the wherewithall to settle down, they
domesticated animals and learned to utilize their byproducts. Dairy foods (milk, cheese, yogurt)
flourished. <a href="http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/Text/5f.html">Pasteurization</a> [1861]
played a significant role in the history milk production. 

<p>
"Throughout the history and prehistory of the human species, breast milk provided the major sustenance for a person's first

"The milks of other species of mammal is one of humankind's most ancient foods--it was in fact
the most
significant single contribution of the Neolithic peoples' domestication of animals to the human
diet. Over the
millennia most species of livestock have been milked, including in various parts of the world
horses,
donkeys, camels, buffaloes, and yaks (the only major exception is the pig...), but today in the
West the
term milk, unless further qualified, is generally taken to refer to cow's milk...The word milk is
ancient too. It
can be traced back to our Indo-European ancestors, who used a verb something like *melf- for 
 wiping' or
  stroking'. Since the action of milking involved the pulling the hand down the animal's teat, this
verb
eventually came to mean  milk'. But it was the Germanic languages that picked it up, in the form
*meluks,
as a noun."<br>

"The oldest known record of animals being kept in herds and milked is a series of cave paintings
in the
Libyan Dahara, showing milking and perhaps cheese-making too, and possibly older than 5,000
BC. The
Sumerians, around 3500 BC, and the Egyptians a few centuries later used milk and have left
reliefs and
records showing that they prepared curdled milk products."<br>

"Domestication of cattle probably started because wild cattle were attracted to the fields of grain
grown by
early farmers and robbed these abundant supplies of food...Exactly when domestication took
place is
uncertain, but by 3000BC there is evidence for several well-defined breed in representations of
cattle from
both Mesopotamia and Egypt..."<br>

"Although cattle have been domesticated for less than 10,000 years, they are the world's most
important
animal, as judged by their multiple contributions of draft power, meat, milk, hides, and
dung...Evidence for
the domestication of cattle dates from between 8,000 and 7,000 years ago in southwestern Asia.
Such
dating suggests that cattle were not domesticated until cereal domestication had taken place,
whereas
sheep and goats entered the barnyard of humans with the beginning of agriculture...As with sheep
and
goats, the process of domesticating cattle resulted in animals smaller than the wild progenitor.
Dated
osteological material from Neolithic sites establishes the transition from wild to
domesticated...The Fertile
Crescent has long been considered the place of initial cattle domestication, but that view tends to
reflect the
large number of excavations made there. Early signs of Neolithic cattle keeping have also been
found in
Anatolia (Turkey), where the osteological material at Catal Huyuk provides evidence of the
transition from
the auruchs of 8,400 years ago to cattle by 7,800 years ago. In short, it is still premature to
specify where
the first cattle were domesticated...Westward diffusion of cattle throughout Europe was tied to
the invention
of the wooden plow. The harnessing of a powerful animal to that device made it possible to
greatly extend
cultivation without a corresponding increase in human population..."<br>

"The second unlooked-for benefit of animal domestication...was milk. The fact that animals

animals could be induced to supply to their new masters must have come as a revelation. Milk
being highly
perishable...a few hours would be enough to start it fermenting in the climate of the Near East.
Depending
upon the temperature and the kind of bacteria in the air, the curds might develop into something
pleasant
and refreshing, or something quite uneatable even by Neolithic peoples...Throughout much of
history, and
especially in hot climates, milk has always been most used in one or other of its soured or

"Archeologists excavating lake dwellings on the banks of Lake Neuchatel have found potsherds
pierced

could have
been drainers for separating curds from whey...What kind of milk might the ancient lake-dwellers
have
been processing in this way?...Although domestication of goats and sheep was beginning to
change the
way of life of the Mediterranean peoples at this period, we do not yet know if they had reached
the stage of
milking the animals and making dairy produce to keep. Cows did not appear on the Alpine scene
until after
the Roman conquest of the Valais 53 centuries later...Noah's descendant Abraham,  very rich in
 cattle'
presented to him by Pharaoh, gave  butter, and milk, and the calf which he had  'dressed' to the

corral...The milk
is put into large, carefully cleaned jars...Goats and sheep will adapt easily to any climate and
browse on any
kind of weed; goats will eat most prickly plants as well. They long supplied most of the milk that
was drunk
or made in to butter and cheese. Cattle, worked to the bone as draught animals, provided hardly
any. We
may assume that the Babylonian cows gave milk only at calving time, when they were enjoying a
respite
from work. Virgil does not seem very keen on cow's milk, at least, he recommends its use only for
rearing
calves."<br>

"Milk had an unusual status as a food item in the classical world, because milk, as such, will not
keep (without the use of refrigeration or other modern techniques). So the drinking of fresh milk
was a luxury shared by farmers and nomadic shepherds with those in cities and royal courts who
were rich enough to pay for express delivery...Aristotle observes that sheep, goats and cows all
produce more milk than is needed for their own offspring. These were the sources of most of the
milk that Greeks and Romans used; mare's milk and ass's milk were also sometimes used. The
milk of any of these five animals might be used as an ingredient in kykeon [a magical and
medicinal drink]. Aristotle also refers to the drinking of camel's milk. Much of the milk that
domestic animals produced was turned into cheese, a far more stable substance and an excellent
food. Both milk and cheese were typical foods of shepherds."<br>

comedy scenes. Milk is called for, incidentally, in only three of the Roman recipes of Apicius. In a

land. Hence, in Greek literature, milk-drinking is a mark of the pastoral peoples who did not, like

"Milk played a part in the diet of the people of Britain from the time when the first neolithic
farmers brought
their domestic cows, sheep and goats into the coutry. At that period cow milk was the kind most
often
drunk; for cows, which could live off the leaves of the forest that covered almost the whole
country, far
outnumbered the grazing animals. Over several hundreds of years some parts of the woodland
were
gradually cleared, and by Bronze Age times there was more open terrain in which sheep and goats
could
be kept. Ewes, like cows, were milked; so also were she-goats."<br>

withal'...Milk and milk products were useful adjuncts to the cuisine of the gentry, and enriched
certain of
their dishes...The peasant's cow was his  commonwealth, providing him and his family with 
butter, cheese,
whey, curds, cream, sod (boiled) milk, raw-milk, sour-milk, sweet-milk, and  butter-milk'...The

Biesting (beesting, French: amouille) is an old term that means the first milk given by a cow after calving. This milk would be thicker, yellowish and especially rich in nutrients. A beesting
cake presumably would have used this type of milk. We also find mentions of beesting custard. According to the <i>

shepherds and dairymaids. In the 17th century, and on into the 18th, both buttermilk and whey became fashionable city drinks
(being drunk by the diarist Pepys, for instance, in 1664). In recent times, after a long period when buttermilk was in 
low esteem, more people have come to regard it as a healthful alternative to ordinary milk, having much less fat. Its slightly
sour taste is seen as an attraction: less cloying than whole milk and more interesting than plain skimmed milk."<br>

there should be some way to preserve it for commercial uses. I said to Mr. Webster, 'Try and see fi you can preserve it in some 
practical and inexpensive way. Perhaps it can be done in tins. If not, it may be dried, possibly, by driving the water cut of it,
and then the consumer may restore the water and have his buttermilk fresh and wholesome any time.' We hope to get some sort of practical
results from our experiments."<br>

"Buttermilk is the residual milk left over after churning and having removed the fat. It forms a capital beverage and it allays thirst
most effectively. Buttermilk is extensively used by the peasantry of some European and Asiatic countries. It must of 
necessity be used while cool and fresh as it rapidly decomposes and becomes rancid. Its action is diuretic to meet most 
individuals and unfortunate by most of it is fed to swine instead of being utilized by the human race...Dietitians serve it
freely to patients in hospitals and in X-ray or Roetigenologic work as it is generally agreed that buttermilk is the ideal medium
for carrying bismuth of barium sulphate in suspension. it is not feasable to even attempt to have an adequate supply of fresh
buttermilk always on hand, of course...To meet these very requirements, therefore, scientists and rentgenologists have made extensive
experiments and have successfully found that buttermilk in a dehydrated form is satisfactory and none of its virtues are impaired 
by sujbjection to that process. Just as the buttermilk comes from the churn it is dehydrated. The water is  expressed from the 
liquid, but nothing is added to the buttermilk solids thus obtained. When it is intended to be used, water is added to the dry 
product and you have fresh buttermilk again. This 'pan-dried' buttermilk is highly recommended as it permanently retains its
properties, whereas in the natural state buttermilk spoils very quickly...Where there is an unusual degree of humidity, it may cake
if not carefully stored; a little crushing in a mortar renders it normal and ready for use..."<br>

"In the world of instants, there's a new product with old-fashioned appeal. It's cultured buttermilk powder, with when mixed with
 water, can be used in biscuit, muffin, pancake, and cake recipes in place of fluid buttermilk. The product, which hails from 
Wisconisn, the dairy state, is just being introduced in our markets. It offers economic benefits as well as shelf stability.
 But what about product performance? To find out, we pitted the powder against fluid buttermilk in the two most popular
 buttermilk-based recipes--biscuits and chocolate cake. The results were promising...The convenience from of old-fashioned
buttermiilk does have some economic benefits. A canister containing a pound of powder, when reconsittuted, makes 5 quarts of 
buttermilk. Suggested retail price for the powder is $1.89. Five quarts of fluid buttermilk costs about 67 cents a quart, or about 
$3.35 for an equivalent amount. The buttermilk product is also shelf-stable...Though the product has only been on retail shelves
a few short months, it already has gained a good following, according to the company representatives...Buttermilk has been a home
baking ingredient for nearly 50 years, according to the company literature. Originally, it was strictly a farm product, but in the 
1920s the by-product of buttermaking became a commercial commodity. What makes buttermilk so special is that it gives baked goods
 a lighter, more fluffy texture. Real buttermilk contains a natural emulsifier that helps disperse fat throughout a mix or batter...

 centrifuge, far more thorough than any hand skimming. The next came in 1890, when a University of Wisconsin dairy chemist invented the eponymous Babcock 
test for measuring the precise fat content in milk-at the time, the chief indicator of quality. These two advances led to intense growth in the butter industry, which 
became the most lucrative destination for milk. The third crucial achievement was homogenization, or the technique of crushing milkfat globules into droplets too 
small to rise to the surface in a cream layer. Homogenization had to overcome several obstacles before it could be coupled with the first two advances. It disrupted 
the chemical structure of the milkfat so drastically as to release a torrent of enzymes that promptly turned raw milk rancid. Even when dairy chemists learned to
 sidestep rancidity by combining the steps of pasteurizing (which inactivated the enzymes) and homogenizing, there remained the age-old consumer habit of judging 
milk by its richness-i.e. the thickness of the cream layer on top. When packaging in glass bottles came in toward the start of the twentieth century, one of its 
advantages from a buyer's point of view was the plainly visible 'creamline.' The fact that homogenized milk in glass tended to acquire an unpleasant oxidized flavor 
on exposure to light more rapidly than creamline milk was another strike against it. As a result, until shortly after World War II few people saw any reason to want 
homogenized milk. Milk for drinking was almost without exception available in only two degrees of richness: with or without all the original fat. Skim milk, or what
 was left when the cream was separated for other purposes, was the ugly sister. Health experts warned mothers that it was paltry stuff, deficient in crucial nutrients.
 (Most state required that it be fortified with vitamin A to replace the fat-soluble beta-carotene that disappeared along with the cream; this step is still mandatory for
 fat-free and most reduced-fat milk.) At the nation's creameries skim milk was an unvalued by-product, often dumped for lack of any profitable use. As early as the
 late 1930s a few dairy processors had been trying to win people over to homogenized milk. The turning point came with a postwar shift to opaque paper or 
cardboard containers in place of returnable milk bottles. This in turn accompanied another shift away from home delivery and toward supermarket purchases of
 milk..."From the '60s or '70s on, hasty public health re-education campaigns sought to convert consumers to 'the less, the better' attitudes regarding fat percentages 
in milk, with zero being the new ideal. Zero was easily attainable through centrifuging, but centrifuged skim milk lacked the flavor-saving smidgin of cream that 
remained in the milk after hand skimming. Some people uncomplainingly adopted zero-fat milk; many more balked. The milk-processing industry eventually arrived
 at a spectrum of products starting with 0 percent milkfat milk and progressing through various homogenized gradations of fat content: .05 percent (officially 
'low-fat'), 1 percent, 1.5 percent, and 2 percent (these last three 'reduced fat'). All quickly acquired fan clubs that are now an entrenched part of American culture. 
For a long time the hardest sell remained skim milk, and for good reason: The usual commercial versions are a singularly thin, vapid travesty of decent
 hand-skimmed milk. But eventually processors hit on the stratagem of using dried skim milk solids to add body and selling the result under names like 'Skim Milk 
Plus.'.""<br>---<i>Milk: The Surprising Story of Milk Through the Ages</i>, Anne Mendelson [Alfred A. Knopf:New York] 2008 (p. 45-47)

"Milk, that all-American food, is taking on some all-American names--like "fat free," "reduced fat" and "light." Starting Jan. 1, 1998, the labeling of fat-reduced 
milk products will have to follow the same requirements the Food and Drug Administration established almost five years ago for the labeling of just about every other
 food reduced in fat. From now on: 
2 percent milk will become known, for example, as "reduced fat" or "less fat" instead of "low fat" 
1 percent milk will remain "low fat" or become, for example, "little fat" 
skim will retain its name or be called, for example, fat-free, zero-fat, or no-fat milk. 
Also, the regulations that implement the labeling changes give dairy processors more leeway to devise new formulations. As a result, consumers may see a broader
 range of milk and other dairy products, including "light" milk with at least 50 percent less fat than whole, or full-fat, milk and other reformulated milks with reduced 
fat contents but greater consumer appeal."<br>

Modern powdered milk (aka dried milk, dessicated milk, milk powder) was developed as a lighter alternative to canned milk products. The
product goals were the same: inexpensive, shelf-stable, & portable. Powdered milk is a more complicated product to meet consumer demands. Think: flavor
& reconsitution. Some food historians trace the genesis of dried milk products to Medieval times. Powdered milk, as we know it today, descends from 
mid-19th century commercial health food experiments.

<b>[20th century: commercial powdered milk] </b><br>
"From the late nineteenth century on, manufacturers were looking into the possibility of converting unsoured milk into a form still more 
durable than canned milk, and cheaper to handle and package in large volumes. Early versions had a sweetish, cooked flavor, slightly 
mitigated as the technology improved. The Great Depression and World War II brought about large-scale diversion of milk 
surpluses, in dried form, to domestic food-assistance programs and international relief agencies. These are still the mainstays of the 
industry. Huge amounts also find their way into commercial confectionery, baked goods, canned soups, frozen foods, and many more uses... 
nowadays dried milk solids are often used to 'enrich' commercial skim milk...for decades, a stubborn drawback discouraged retail sales of 
dried milk: the difficulty of dissolving the powder quickly and smoothly in cold water. The problem was solved in the mid-1950s 
by a new technique of getting the powdered grains to aggregate in minute crystals. Millions of consumers took to instant dried 
milk as a thrifty alternative to fresh milk. For a while it was the darling of the nutrition-minded recipe developers, who encouraged home 
cooks to put supposedly vitalizing doses of dried milk into sauces, puddings, and breads. Another technical problem was more intractable: 
the tendency of milkfat to develop spoiled or harsh flavors in the drying process. Dairy processors did find solutions, but they 
were expensive enough to make mass-produced whole dried milk economically infeasible. This is why virtually all commercial 
brands are non-fat, though there is some distribution of whole dried milk in health-food stores." <br>

<b>Skim milk</b><br>
Our research indicates people have been skimming fat off milk from the beginning of time forwards. The skimmed rich fatty substance was traditionally churned into 
butter or transformed into creamy cheeses. The leftover [skimmed] milk was traditionally regarded as inferior and discarded or consumed by the desperate poor.
 Into the late 19th century,  skim milk continued to be regarded as questionable dairy by-product: devoid of nutritional content, desirable taste, and economic 
promise. Laws were passed to protect unsuspecting consumers against this chalky travesty being sold as "whole milk." Honest dairymen battled popular perception
 for economic survival. Health officials successfully lobbied Congress to enact the first Food and Drug laws [1906] to ensure proper labeling and public health.
 Impure milk was indeed a documented public health problem. The problem was not, however, connected with fat content.
<p>
During WWII skim milk flooded the American market in both liquid and dried forms. For obvious reasons. For the first time, commercial dairies & government 
agencies combined forces by actively promoted this particular dairy option as healthy and "all American." Folks farming Victory Gardens gladly gulped skim milk. 
Once the War was over, middle-class suburban baby-boomers fed their babies gallon after gallon of whole milk. In the 1960s-1970s the skim milk phoenix rose 
again. This time the product was marketed as a healthy alternative to the regular fat-filled variety. Thus initiating the long parade of <a href="foodbeverages.html#lowfatmilk">low-fat</a> grades we encounter 
today. In sum? If you're looking for an example of how a particular food has been used to promote political agenda, you'd be hard pressed to find a better
 specimen than skim milk.

"There exists to-day a strong trend of opinion in favor of sour milk. In the last few years it has been the subject of numerous investigations by 
chemists and bacteriologists in the laboratory, as well as by doctors in the clinics. Considering the favorable results of these various 
studies, the use of sour milk as a wholesome food has rapidly increased these last few years, especially in Europe, where in almost all the 
largest cities the sale of sour milk, not only for hospitals, but as an article of daily diet, is very common. The question seems new 
in America, where the manufacturers still in small number, are taking advantage of the lack of competition and thus making of a wholesome 
food a fancy product. A pint of sour milk is sold for 25 cents, although made with skimmed milk. Nothing can justify this high price, and it is 
desirable to see this wholesome product put within the reach of every purse. Sour milk, as it is recommended to-day, possessing salutary 
properties, is made with milk which has been previously boiled, in order to destroy all harmful bacteria, and started with a pure culture of 
specific lactic acid ferment. When fermentation is complete--the time required is different with the kind of culture used, and according with the 
specific lactic ferment used--a curd more or less consistent is formed, sweetened, when it is fresh, about usually slightly sour, with an agreeable 
taste and aroma. The term bacteria has, in the popular mind, the meaning of evil. It has been conclusively demonstrated to-day 
that human beings and animals cannot live without intestinal bacteria. There exist harmful and useful bacteria, and it is necessary, 
in order to combat the chances of evil, to fight the former and multiply the latter...Nothing is older than the use of sour milk, and 
nothing seems newer than the applications which have been recently made of it. Mention of sour milk is made in the Bible...Inquiry on the 
subject seems to show that civilized people are the only ones to use raw or boiled milk, while sour milk is almost the only kind used outside the pale of our 
civilization." <br>

"The fashionable craze of the moment is neither drinking or aviation, but the drinking of sour milk or the munching of specially prepared tabloids, 
charged with sour milk bacteria. The craze began a little while ago with the publication of Dr. Reinhardt's book, 'One Hundred and Twenty 
Years of Life,' in which he detailed Prof. Metchinikoff's theory that sour milk prepared according to the Bulgarian plan is the real 
elixir of life. Dr. Metchnikoff, the famous pathologist of the Pasteur Institute of Paris, was much struck when visiting Bulgaria 
to find that in many of the country parts the proportion of centenarians was greater than anywhere else. He started to investigate the 
cause and came to the conclusion that the long life of the people was due ot the fact that they used sour milk in their daily dietary. 
This milk, prepared by means of a living culture of lactic acid form of bacilli, destroys putrefactive organisms in the human 
stomach, so at least D. Metchnikoff maintained...Every chemist shop is full of sour milk lozenges and chocolates. Every careful wife is 
urging her husband to drink specially prepared Metchnikoff milk that is sold by the leading dairy companies at 
fabulous prices. Cooks have a fresh burden added to their lives by being asked to prepare sour milk at home, a process taking 
many hours and much careful regulation of temperature. Meanwhile the folk to whom an expenditure of from $2 to $5 a head for specially 
prepared sour milk is impossible can obtain much the same result by drinking buttermilk." <br>

"I have had a number of letters recently asking why we specify the use of sour milk in some of our recipes when it is impossible to make

In trying to sour milk the housewife follows the old farm method--sets the milk in a warm place and lets it stand for a day or so. But 
she cannot obtain a milk of the good old fashioned sour milk flavor with the pasteurized milk. The reason is that a number of the lactic 
acid bacteria (the beneficial bacteria in milk) are killed along with the harmful ones in pasteurization. And not enough of them are 
left to produce a pronounced lactic acid flavor when the milk is given an opportunity to sour. When I develop or test a recipe 
that demands the use of a sour milk I use buttermilk." <br>

just off flavor. On the other hand, throw out all that grows bitter...It has been found better to force the souring a little, for it if occurs 
slowly less variable types of bacteria also will have a chance to grow and the flavor will be changed. Therefore, keep the milk to 
be soured at room temperature until it thickens. Another point. In measuring out sour milk, make sure that you are getting equal parts of curds and whey. To do this, simply 
whip them together quickly with an egg beater until all parts are mixed, and measure out immediately. It is pleasantly simple to 
substitute sour milk for sweet in many bread and cake recipes if we remember to make a few other changes. For instance, for good our 
milk, allow one-half teaspoon soda for a cup of milk. More, of course, will be needed if the recipe also calls for molasses, which in itself 
is somewhat acid...Also, if we are substituting sour cream for milk, we are adding excess fat and therefore must reduce the fat 
considerably in our recipe." <br>

"When you begin tightening the family purse strings you will find there are many short cuts to good cooking that help save pennies here and 
there. Take the sour milk you prefer to certain breads, cakes and biscuits, because of the other tender texture, the delicate, moist 
quality sour milk gives the home-baked product. Sour milk savings are a part of our American tradition. In recent years, though, 
sour milk has become less commonplace, for with our fine refrigeration milk seldom turns sour as nature intended it should...Now when we want to 
do some good old-fashioned baking we must buy sour milk or buttermilk. Since we seldom see the whole bottle some of it is sure to be 
wasted. To eliminate these leftovers, and at the same time assure successful baking, you can make your own 
sour milk as you need it by adding vinegar to the sweet milk you have on hand. Here is a general rule to follow: Add two tablespoons pure 
cider vinegar gradually to one cup of sweet milk stirring constantly. If possible let it stand an hour before using, so that it will 
thicken up slightly." <br>

<b>When was milk first sold to consumers by the gallon?</b><br>

Historic newspapers and industry publications return references to  milk sold in "gallon jugs" from 1939 forwards. Earliest print 
references suggest this larger container was developed and promoted to save the consumer money (buy in bulk). Industry articles examine the requirements for launching the new 
larger size. Dairies, traditionally fitted for pint, quart and half gallons would have to be retooled to accommodate the larger volume unit. The U.S. Department of 
Agriculture studied the economic and health aspects of this industry development. There was much controversy on a
 state-by-state basis about selling milk in gallon jugs. Pro: consumer savings Con: costly retrofit & less profit for dairies. By the late 1940s, gallon jugs were available
 in some, but not all places. Gallon milk jugs were debated by legislators and settled in courts. Some period newspapers imply gallon jugs were sold to consumers before they
became "legal." General industry acceptance appears to occur in the late 1950s. By the early 1960s the gallon jug is ubiquitous.

"The California Supreme Court yesterday after lengthy arguments by Asst. Atty. Gen. Walter L. Bowers, took under submission, with indications of an early decision, the co-called
'gallon jug' case concerning milk prices in Los Angeles County and elsewhere in the state. Early last year Superior Judge Charles D. Ballard permanently enjoined the then Director
of Agriculture, A.A. Brock, from enforcing any of the provisions of the Milk Stabilzation Act, providing for minimum prices to producers and minimum wholesale and
retail prices for fluid milk. The original action was brought by G.S. Ray and numerous other plaintiffs, selling milk from dairy stores, mostly in gallon containers. They claimed they shoudl be
permitted a lesser price than regular retail stores thus becoming known as the 'gallon jug' group. Judge Ballard held the statute unconstituional, and ruled that the director had failed to 
comply with the same from its inception and operation of the law in Los Angeles County in 1939. Since Judge Ballard's ruling the Supreme Court, in the so called
Jersey Milk Products case versus Brock, held that the act is constitutional. The director then appealed the Ray case."<br>

price to the commission. By law the commission must agree on the per-gallon price before the new containers become legal this summer. The
hearing promises to engender as much controversy as has the price governing Virgina milk sales in half-gallon containers.
 A spokesman for the Milk Distributors Association of Virginia said he failed to see how the per gallon price could be set lower than the 
94 cents retailers receive for the same quantity of milk now sold either by the quart or in two half-gallon containers. On the other hand,
C.Y. Stephens, owner of High's Dairy Products Corp., which operates 17 retail outlets in the area, said he will continue to press for a 
78 cents gallon. Stephens said he will appear before the commission today with cost figures 'I don't see how they can laugh off.'..
Since the sale of milk in the half-gallon containers became legal in Virginia last fall...the High Co. has donated the extra 8 cents

Mint Julep is heralded by some as the quintessential American cocktail. Built on bourbon, it is traditionally connected with

<b>What is mint julep?</b><br>
"To twentieth-century drinkers a julep is a product of the Deep South of the USA...a strong but refreshing mixture of Kentucky
bourbon or rye whiskey and sugar, poured over ice, and flavoured typically with sprigs of fresh mint. It was not always so,
however. Originally, a julep was any sweet syrupy drink, often one used as a vehicle for medicine (William Buchan's Domestic
Medicine (1789) mentions 'cordial julep, expectorating julep and misk julep'). In that sense, the term has long since passed
into limbo, but it may survive dialectally in the slightly altered from jollop, 'medicine'. The word julep comes via
Arabic julab from Persian gulab, which meat literally 'rose-water.'"<br>

"Mint Julep. A cocktail made from bourbon, sugar, and mint. It is a classic drink of Kentucky and is traditionally served at the
running of the Kentucky Derby on the first Saturday in May. The word first appeared printed in John Davis's Travels of Four Years and a Half 
in the United States (1803) as a 'dram of spiritous liquor that has mint in it, taken by Virginians in the morning.' The
origin of the word 'julep'...indicates a very sweet concoction known since the fifteenth century. Mint juleps were known in the
United States by the end of the eighteenth century, long before bourbon became the ingredient most associated with the
drink, and one will find mint juleps made with whiskeys other than bourbon, though this would be heresy in the state of Kentucky,
 where there is also great debate as to whether the mint leaves should be crushed in the traditional silver mug."<br>

"Americans in Virginia, according to Richard Barksdale Harwell, the author of <i>The Mint Julep</i>, added spirits in 1878 and mint
in 1803 and originated the mint julep. Deciding that the English might like this new version, Captain Frederick Marryat, who had been traveleing
in America, reintroduced the mint julep to the English in 1837. Marryat noted that the mint julep is 'one of the most 
delightful and insinuating potations that ever was invented.' The first mint julep recipes called for brandy or rum, but local
whiskey, frequently home-distilled rye or bourbon soon became the spirits of choice. Charles Joseph Latrobe, who described the mint
julep in 1833 at a meeting of the Anti-Temperance Society in Saratoga, Florida, declared the mint must be unbruised. Jerry
Thomas, in <i>How to Mix Drinks</i>, which was published in 1862, called for bruising the mint. The issue is still being 
debated. Both Latrobe and Thomas called for filling a tumbler or glass with shaved ice. Preparation of mint julep is seeped in
ceremony and is a symbol of southern hospitality...Although the mint julep is appreciated throughout the South, Kentuky, proud
of its bourbon, popularized the drink in the twentieth century. The years and date are unknown, but a letter written by Judge
Soule Smith in the late nineteenth century makes clear that Kentucky bourbon should be the whiskey of choice for a mint
julep. Mint julep in a glass maked 'Kentucky Derby' was first served in the dining room at Churchill Downs, home of the derby, 
in 1938."<br>

whole is sufficently impregnated with the flavour of the mint, which is extracted by the particles of the ice coming into brisk 
contact when changed from one vessel to the other. Now place the glass in a larger one, containing pounded ice: on taking it out of which it will be

"Juleps.</b> The julep is peculiary an American beverage, and in the Southern states is more popular than any other.  It was
introduced into England by Captain Marryatt, where it is now quite a favorite. The gallant captain seems to have had a penchant for
the nectareous drink, and published the recipe in his work on America. We got it in his own words: "I must decant a little upon the mint
julep, as it is, with the thermometer at 100 degrees, one of the most delightful and insinuating potations that ever was invented, and
may be drunk with equal satisfaction when the thermometer is as low as 70 degrees. There are many varieties, such as those composed of
claret, Madeira, &c.; but the ingredients of the real mint julep are as follows. I learned how to make them, and succeeded pretty well. 
Put into a tumbler about a dozen sprigs of the tender shoots of mint, upon them put a spoonful of white sugar, and equal proportions of 
peach and common brandy, so as to fill it up one-third, or perhaps a little less. Then take rasped or pounded ice, and fill up the
tumbler. Epicures rub the lips of the tumber with a piece of fresh pineapple, and the tumbler itself is very often incrusted outside
with stalactites of ice. As the ice melts, you drink. I once overheard two ladies taliking in the next room to me, and one of them
said, 'Well, if I have a weakness for any one thing, it is for a mint julep!'--a very amiable weakness, in fact, like the 
American ladies, irresistable.'<p>

"Pendennis Club Mint Julep</b><br>
<i>By a well-known member of the club, Louisville, Ky.</i><br>
There are some essentials:<br>
1st. Fine, straight, old Kentucky Bourbon whisky--blended whiskies do not give good results.<br>
2d. An Abundant supply of freshly cut sprigs of mint--prefereably young shoots--no portion of which has been bruised.<br>
3d. Dry, cracked flint ice. A glass will answer the purpose, but a silver mug is preferable. At this club, silver cups are kept on 
ice. A syrup of sugar and water is also kept on hand.<br>
The silver cup is first filled with the ice, and then the desired quantity of fine whisky poured in and thooughly shaken with a spoon or shaker
until a heavy frost forms on the mug. The desired amount of syrup is then poured in and stirred enough to be mixed. The mint is then carefully
placed in the mugs and the stems barely sticking in the ice and the tops projecting 2 inches above the top of the cup. Straws are then placed in the
cup, reaching from the bottom to about 1 inch above the top, and the sooner one sticks one's nose in the mint and begins drinking though
the straws the better. There is no flavor of mint, merely the odor. Any stinting in quality or quantity materilally affects the result."<br>

"Now, gentlemen, at long last are eight or so Mint Julep ceremonies--Being various adaptations of this peerless American conception from all
parts of the world where it is properly revered. Right from the meaning of the word Juleps have been a spill-and-pelt of
contradition and disagreement...The very name itself never was midwifed on any honeysuckle-bowered southern balcony, but comes from
the Persian gulab, or Arab julab, meaning rose water....No sane Kentucky planter, in full posession of his faculties will yield an inch
to any Marylander when it comes to admitting rye is superiour to bourbon in a Julep, when actually, a Julep is international and has
been international for years--just as the matters of radio and flying are international. It is a drink composed of whiskey or 
brandy--and, of late--rum; sweetened, iced, and flavoured with aromatic leaves of the mentha family. So before the shooting starts let's
explain right here and now that there's no more chance of getting the various Julep schools to agree on fabrication of the most
delectiable of drinks, than we have of getting a proud Atlanta great-grandmother to concede General Sherman a nice, gentlye, well-meaining,
big boy. First of all there is the silver cup versus the glass school; the chilled glass versus room-temperature school; the slightly bruised mint
versus the all-bruised school; the rye versus the bourbon school; the fruit garnish versus the plain school. Feuds have begin because someone
breathed the possibility that city water would make a Julep as well as water dipped from a fern-draped Blue Grass spring.
Men have been shot att for heaping fruit juices, slices of citrus, and maraschino cherries on a Julep completed. Families have faced
divorcement about the slight-appearing concern of red-stemmed mint. A gentleman who discards the slightly bruised mint from
his drink views another who permits the bruised leaves to remain in the glass as one who did not have quite the proper forbearanced on
the distaff side...And so they tell the tale--Getting right down to cases, there is no more need for argument of violent nature along
such lines...On this matter of Juleps we can boast to a thorough Julep research, without pride or prejudice, for we have put in some years
of mightly clinical home-work on the matter!...But the best Julep of all, up to date---was mixed by Monk Antrim's...Manila Hotels, Luzon, P.I., and A.D.

unusual track for inscription here--as he does not bruise mint, even slightly. Take a sixteen ounce silver Julep cup, or the same in class. Into the
bottom put a lump of sugar and dissolve it in a little spring or well water. Choose the tenderest mint sprigs and toss in
three-arranging them in the bottom, and don't crush or bruise at all. Fill the chalice with finely crushed ice. Turn in two
jiggers of the best old bourbon the cellar can afford, and stir once to settle. Add enough more ice to fill; a complete small bundle of
tender mint comes next, trimmming the stalks fairly short, so as to give out their aromatic juices into the Julep. Place in the ice, and 
stand aside for a few minutes to frost and acquire general merit."<br>

LOCAL COMMERCIALIZATION
"Mabi (fermented Caribbean beverage made from tree bark):
This beverage is loved by people who are from Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Haiti. It has been made for generations, normally made at home and sold on local street corners. The bark from the mabi tree is boiled then sugar and other ingredients are added. Once the drink begins to ferment they drink it. It's supposed to lower blood pressure, reduce cholesterol and even make men more virile! The mabi drink has never been commercially available until now. Global Beverage realized that tens of millions of these ethnic customers could not get mabi here in the U.S., so after two years of research and development, they've reformulated the beverage, removing the alcohol and the fermentation odor, thus making it more enjoyable. Now even kids can have an ice cold mabi drink. Four-pack is $ 2.99. Single 12 fl oz bottles are .99 cents." Global Beverage Enterprises

<a name="mulled">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Mulled drinks</b></font><br>

According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, the word mulled, as it applies to the culinary world, was first printed in 1607. 
The word first applied to mulled wine, defined: "Of ale, wine, cider, etc.: Made into a sweetened and spiced hot drink and
sometimes thickened with beaten yolk of egg."
<p>
"Hot spiced wine, often called "mulled wine," is typically made by simmering red, and occasionally white, wine with a mixture
of citrus (juice, slices, or zest from lemons or oranges) and virtually any combination of spices, including cinnamon, 
clove, allspice, ginger, cardamom, nutmeg, or mace. Wines ranging from dry table wines to sweet ports or fortified wines
(strengthened with additional alcohol) are used...This beverage has an ancient history, stemming from early 
civilization of 5000 B.C.E. (Mesopotamia and Egypt) and subserquently Greece and Rome. Wines were sometimes infused with 
herbs and spices for a range of gastronomic, hallucinogenic, medicinal, religious, and preservation purposes. In medieval
Europe wine was customarily consumed as a safer, healthier alternative to often-contaminated water. In colder climates, wine and
other fermented beverages were sometimes heated to create longed-for and much-needed warmth...The introduction of tropical 
spices to medieval Europe opened the door to a wide range of flavors. Wildly expensive and exotic at the same time, they were
available only to the wealthy and were used to enrich the libation hippocras, the descendant of an ancient Roman drink.
Hippocras was made from wine heated with honey, pepper, and many other spices, such as galingale (similar to ginger), and
it was often consumed as an elixir at the end of a large feast. Although it occasionally appeared later in seventeenth-century
cookbooks, it had lost most of its high status and popularity by then. By the later part of the seventeenth century, European trade
with India and the Indonesian Spice Islands had begun to flourish...These tropical spices (such as cinnamon and nutmeg) began
to replace earlier European flavorings in heated wines and dramatically changed the taste and character of the wines. In addtion,,
the British in India encountered a local spiced "paunch" (later called "punch"), a warmed beverage consisting of a fermented
drink, sugar, water, citrus, and spices...These appeared in the American colonies as mulled wine, sometimes made with 
thickening raw eggs or yolks, which would be cooked by the hot wine. The resultant curdling was reminiscent of such other
period concoctions as possets, caudles, and syllabub. Many English, German, Dutch and Scandinavian emigrants who came to 
America brought these long-held traditions and prepared heated and spiced libations for winter festivals, in particular,
Christmas...By the late 1800s these warmed spiced wines had become an integral part of the American Christmas menu, largely because
of the strong influence of the middle nineteenth-century novel A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens. Hot spiced wine was
frequently served alongside or in lieu of eggnog enjoyed at middle-class tables, sometimes with appropriate temperance 
substitutions of fruit juice."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Punch</b></font><br>
Early American cookbooks typically offer one or two recipes combining citrus fruit (typically lemons or limes) with rum and sugar. They are generally called punch. Some of these can be quite 
complicated. Ingredients vary according to availability; proportions vary according to taste. Primary documents (journals, letters, inventories, account books) may 
help you determine the full locus of ingredients and description of final product served in a given place by a specific

<b>Why is it called "punch? & what were the 5 original ingredients?</b><br>
"Punch in Hindi means five, and the first paunch, and then punch, was the name that eventually settled on the five-component
drink made up at first of arrack, spices, sugar, lime juice and water. It was first noted by Mendelslo in AD 1638 as palepunzen in
Dutch, and became punch about fourty years later. In course of time, numerous recipes for the drink developed, including one with milk in 
it, described in AD 1823 in Madras. Punch houses were set up on Goa by the Portuguese, and later in Calcutta and Madras."<br>
---<i>A Historical Dictionary of Indian Food</i>, K.T. Achaya [Oxford University Press:Delhi] 1998 (p. 201)<br>
[NOTE: Arrack was a distilled spirit made with fermented rice and molasses. It was made in the Far East and Middle East.]
<p>
"Punch. The vogue for punch started in England in the early seventeenth century, imported by officers of the East India Company.
it was a traditional long drink in India, and its name is generally supposed to be of Indian origin, too. This conjecture seems to have
started with John Fryer, who in his <i>Acccount of East India</i> (1698) derived punch from Hindi panch meaning 'five', from the
five ingredients of the drink: sugar spirits, lemon or lime juice, water, and spices. However, in the seventeeth century the word
would have been pronounced not, as now to rhyme with lunch, but with a short "oo' sound, 'poonch', and this is not really consistent
with a borrowing from Hindi panch; so it has been speculated that it is short for puncheon, a large cask from which the
drink might have been served. The classic simplicity of the original type did not survive long; and assortment of variations was soon dreamed up,
including punch made with tea, with milk (this enjoyed a wave of popularity in the early eighteenth century), and
without any alcohol. Nowadays almost any sort of festive amalgam of drinks served in a bowl, with or without bits of fruit 
swimming in it, is dignified with the name of 'punch'...One drink to maintain the tradition in the rum-based West-Indian planter's
punch..."<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 272-3)

"Rum was the most popular distilled liquor of the [Colonial American] time. It was widely served in taverns, sold in an
assortment of measures, ranging from the gallon to the glass. The most expensive variety was imported from the West Indies (the 
rum of Jamaica was especially prized); both New England and Pennsylvania, however, manufactured their own rum from imported
 Island Molasses...Plain (straight) rum was identified as the drink of the working classes...Rum was also the main ingredients in 
what one writer described as "a very good, pleasant and healthful drink, punch." A popular beverage, punch was considered as genteel
as imported tea. It was routinely served at every conceivable tavern event from political gatherings to the meetings of men's clubs, before
and after a meal, or during an eventing's activities...punch was a combination of then luxurious ingredients. The drink was made using the
rinds and juice of imported lemons, limes, and even oranges, commonly mixed with rum, and white or brown sugar. In some taverns, 
customers paid extra for the inclusion of sugar and fruit in their drinks. Lime punch was the most popular version of the drink, and the 
beverage was aptly described as "Sower punch."...Punch was also made with eggs and milk...Like some other beverages, punch was served
warm and sold in taverns by the bowl. A quart of the mix would fill about half a large punch bowl. Tavern inventories indicate that
both delft...and china...punch bowls, in large and small sizes, were used. Since delft was widely available and inexepensive,
most tavern keepers kept only a modest supply of punch bowls on hand...That punch had a special place in the tavern is also 
evident from the number of silver punch strainers, punch ladles, punch spoons, and even in one cakse, silver punch bowls found
among the stocks of taverns in centers like New York, Boston, Charlestown, Philadelphia, and Williamsburg. With those exceptions, 
silver rarely appears in 18th-century tavern inventories."<br>

"Punch. Although much was said in praise of wine, more was said of punch. This was the Tidewater's standby drink. 
"Punch" is the English rendering of the Hindustani paunch, meaning five, for the five ingredients --spirits, water, 
sliced lemons or limes, sugar, and spice...The recipe for the immortal drink came to England from the Far east, together 
with tea, root ginger, and spice, fine East Indian muslins and cashmere shawls, and other new delights, either by way of
 the fourteenth-century caravan root or by sea around the Cape of Good Hope. In the Tidewater, rum from the West Indies
 and brandy were the chief ingredients of punch...A bowl of punch was the planters' most companionable drink. Many a 
political strategy was hatched, many a long evening of pleasure was spent with a small punch bowl at each right elbow. The
 punch made by one of Williamsburg's tavernkeepers, Henry Wetherburn, figures in a story that is still remembered today. 
In May 1736, after planter William Randolph agreed to sell some of his farm land to Thomas Jefferson's father, he insisted
 on Henry Wetherburn's "biggest bowl of Arrack punch" to seal the bargain."<br>

<a name="rootbeer">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Root beer</b></font><br>
The history of root beer begins with small beer (low alcohol content). These products, often
brewed with roots of medicinal plants, contained small amounts of alcohol. They were considered
health beverages in centuries past. In the 18th and early 19th century, home-made beer composed
of roots (spruce, most notably) commonly appeared in American cook books. <a href="foodbeverages.html#gingerale">Ginger beer</a> was
also popular. By the second half of the 19th century, soft drinks (seltzer, flavored seltzer, soda)
were introduced and marketed as health food products. Root beer was a perfect fit. Food
historians tell us root beer was produced in quantity for public sale in 1876. 
<p>
According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> (2nd edition), the earliest print reference to
"root beer" was published in 1843. Nathaniel Hawthorne mentions both "root beer" and "ginger
beer" in his <i>House of Seven Gables</i> [1851].
<p>
"Now a sweet soft drink flavored with a mixture of herbal essences, root beer was originally a real
beer and a tonic health drink. Small beers, or low-alcohol beers carbonated by the action of
yeasts, have been traditional and nutritious drinks for children, women, and the elderly in England
and Europe for centuries. Although many of these small beers were flavored with ginger or
lemon, another common flavoring and one popular for its antiscurvey properties was that of the
bark of spruce or birch trees. When colonists arrived in North America, they found new varieties
of the traditional spruce and birch for their beers, but discovered Native Americans using such
novel flavorings as the roots of sarsaparilla (Smilax ornata) and sassafras (Sassafras albidum) as
well. Both of these were similar to spruce and birch in taste, and the colonists soon learned to use
them in their small beer, often with molasses as a sweetener and fermenting agent. Exactly when
sweetened small beer made with various roots was first called "root beer" is unknown. One of the
earliest mentions is in Dr. Chase's Recipes from 1869...In 1876, Charles E. Hires, who claimed to
have invented root beer, began marketing packets of the herbal ingredients necessary to make "the
Greatest Health-Giving Beverage in the World" at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. This
kit for making root beer was supposed to contain sixteen roots, herbs, barks, and berries,
including sassafras, the dominant flavoring, and required home fermentation with yeast. In 1884
Hires decided consumers would be more interested in an easier-to-use product and began selling a
liquid concentrate and soda fountain syrup, as well as bottled root beer."<br>

<p>
"By 1819 a patent was issued for "carbonated mead," and in 1824 one for sarsaprilla..."Birch
beer" came along in the 1880s to compete with Philadelphian druggist Charles E. Hires's "Herb
Tea," later changed to "Root Beer" (a previously common term for soda flavored with various
roots and herbs). Hires had first made the beverage in 1875, advertised it as "the National
Temperance Drink" and first served it at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition."<br>

strain while hot, add 8 or 10 drops of oils of spruce and sassafras mixed in equal proportions,
when cool enough not to scald your hand, put in 2 or 3 table-spoons of yeast; molasses two-thirds

trying it; it is best to get the dry roots, or dig them and let them get dry, and of course you can
add any other root known to possess medicinal properties desired in the beer. After all is mixed,
let it stand in a jar with a cloth thrown over it, to work about two hours, then bottle and set in a
cool place. This is a nice way to take alteratives, without taking medicine. And families ought to

"Spaniards like their drinks simple...The general rule is that wines, liquors, and liquers, as well as nonalcoholic beverages, should
be pure and unadulterated. The most outstanding exception to this rule is sangria, a wonderfully refreshing summer drink that became
immensely popular through advertising, then fell into disrepute because of bottling. It is as distasteful to bottle sangria
as it is to can paella and gazpacho...sangria...must be mixed with sweet succulent fruits shortly before drinking to preserve
its lovely fresh flavor...Nothing is more satisfying in summer than an icy cold sangria."<br>

"In Spanish, sangre means blood and sangria means bleeding. The relation to red wine is obvious, but
just when the connection first was made appears lost to history. The flavoring and diluting of wine with
water or fruit juices is almost as old as wine itself. Indeed, before vinification became the science it is
today, many wines had to be cut just to make them palatable."<br>

"Sangria has hit the American shore like the red tide. Two years ago it was little mroe than a name to drop at a poolside cookout or 
cocktail party, or a delicious, exotic memore from vacationing in Mallorca or Marella. Serving it to guests was a sure way of 
scoring a 'first' in any custom housing development. Thsi summer one brand of sangria comes in six packs. At least a half dozen other brands, 
imported and domestic, are best sellers in liquor stores. In most cases, what you buy is a mixture of light, inexpensive red wine, 
citrus fruit juice, a bit of sugar, and perhaps water or soda water. This, like the man says, is your basic sangria, and it can be
made at hoem for about $1.75 a half-gallon. There are hundreds of recipes. Sangria comes from the Spanish 'sangre' [blood], and covers 
almost any fruit punch containing red wine. If economy is not a major factor in its production, there are many elegant, 
expensive, and potent versions."<br>

"As recently as a decade ago, Sangria was a cooling summer quencher known only to a limited handful of aficionados. Then the Spanish
red wine and fruit juice combo became a national rage, especially among the post-Pepsi generation. Now Sangria has setteled into a 
comfortable niche of year-round poplarity, fueld by one of the newer introductions, white sangria. Like the original, white 
sangria is wine and citrus juice, but with white wine isntead of red. A natural innovation, considering the greater popularity of
white wine."<br>

     Shrub was a popular colonial-era cordial 
     made from the juice of a citrus fruit (often raspberries, cherries, lemons or oranges),
     rum, and sugar. According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, archaic spelling
     variations sometimes began with "sch."  Fruit-based vinegars were similarly
     composed. Shrub is related to <a href="foodicecream.html#sherbet">sherbet</a>.
     <p>
     "Shrub has now had its day, but in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries it was a

     word comes from Arabic shurb  beverage, 'drink', and is related to English sherbert,
     sorbet, and syrup."<br>

"Shrub was another such drink, with an Arabic name
denoting a middle eastern origin. It first became popular in the early eighteenth century and was made with brandy, lemon juice

"Recipes for shrub, an alcoholic version of sherbet, were also developed [in the 18th century]. The following comes from Eliza
Smith's Compleat Houswife. Although first published in 1727, it probably reflects culinary practices some decades earlier:
'To make shrub
Take two quarts of brandy, and put it in a large bottle, adding to it the juice of five lemons, the peels of two, and half a
nutmeg; stop it up and let it stand three days, and add to it three pints of white wine, a pound and a half of sugar; mix it,
strain it twice through flannel, and bottle it up; it is a pretty wine, and a cordial'."<br>

"ades," such as appleade, lemonade, orangeade...Fruit juices also were cooked with a large quantity of sugar and preserved for
future use, mainly for use in cooking and baking. In addition, juices were fermented into flavorful vinegars, and they were used
in alcoholic and temperance beverages, including shrubs, which were composed of fruit juice plus spirits or vinegar."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>smoothies</b></font><br>
Although fruit and ice/ice cream/milk/sorbet/yogurt blended combinations have been consumed for
hundreds of years, culinary historians generally place smoothies in the 20th
century, though they can't quite agree which decade. There is no single person or
company credited for inventing the smoothie. In fact? There is no single recipe. In
many places smoothies are promoted as health foods. Are they really? They can be. It all depends
upon the ingredients.
<p>
According to the smoothie experts (cookbooks, articles, industry Web sites) a true smoothie is
usually a milk-based product. This is part (calcium/protein) of what is supposed to make this drink
healthy.  In Mexico and Latin America "Licuado" is the popular local word for smoothie (milk &
fruit based health drink). It does seem to imply a milk-base. According to the <i>Cassell's Spanish
Dictionary</i>, the word "licuado" (in its purest sense) simply means liquefy, as in: mixed in the
blender. It does not imply specific ingredients or a particular recipe.
<p>
"Old world fruits were introduced in America by European settlers in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries...Apples, lemons, and oranges were the main juice fruits, but currants,
grapes, peaches, pineapples, plums, raspberries, and strawberries were also used for juice.
Beginning
in the nineteenth century, the most common way of serving fruit juice was with added sugar and
water in the form of "ades," such as appleade, lemonade, orangeade, and strawberryade. These
juices were sometimes served ice-cold and called "sherbet." For a lighter drink, a few spoonfuls of
these sweetened juices were stirred into cold water. By the nineteenth century, a wide range of
fruit juices were used to flavor ice cream and soda fountain drinks...In the home, fruit was juiced
by hand until 1930, when the first commercial juicing machine was marketed by Norman
Walker, who encouraged a diet of raw food and juices. Juicing became popular in America during
the 1970s. Smoothies, thick drinks consisting of fresh fruit blended with milk, yogurt, or ice
cream, became popular in the 1980s. Juice bars, which frequently serve smoothies, were launched
in the early 1990s in health food stores and quickly evolved into major independent
businesses."<br>
---<i>Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America</i>, Andrew F. Smith [Oxford
University Press:New York] 2004 (p. 534)
<p>
"Juice bars, a billion-dollar business, began modestly in 1926 in Los Angeles when Julius Freed
opened a shop selling fresh orange juice. His real estate agent, Bill Hamlin, a former chemist,
suggested an all-natural mixture that gave the orange juice a creamy, foamy consistency. It
contained orange juice, water, egg whites, vanilla extract, sugar and ice. When Freed and Hamlin
started selling the new beverage, sales soared from twenty dollars to one hundred dollars a day,
and then name for the product arose from the way customers asked for the drink: "Give me an
orange, Julius." By 1929 Orange Julius had grown into a chain with one hundred stores in the
United States. The macrobiotic vegetarianism fad of the mid-1960s stirred up the juice-bar
business with the creation of smoothies, originally a mixture of fruit, fruit juice, and ice cold in the
back of health-food restaurants and stores. Steve Kuhnau started a health-food store in 1973,
offering nutritious energy-packed smoothies as an alternative to the ubiquitious high-fat food of
New Orleans and to help resolve his own health problems. In 1987 Kuhnau and his wife Cindy,
co-founded one fo the major smoothie companies, Smoothie King Franchises Inc. A competitor,
Jamba Juice Company, bagan in 1990 in California as a store that offered fresh-fruit
smoothies...Bt the end of the twentieth century, regional and independent juice bars had sprouted
up across the country...Mobile smoothie stations in carts and kiosks make the drinks even more
available and less expensive to purvey...Many dessert-style smoothies contain milk; ice cream or
ice milk; yogurt or frozen yogurt; sorbet; or soy, rice, or nut milk. Nutritional supplements may be
added."<br>

University Press:New York] 2004 (p. 750-1)
<p>
"Though Kuhnau created Smoothie King and the 20 trademarked drinks sold at Smoothie King
stores, he didn't actually invent the smoothie, a generic name for a non-alcoholic blended fruit
drink. It was born in the counterculture health food stores of southern Califomia in the 1950s and
exists in a variety of forms at different health food stores around the country today."<br>

"The smoothie has been around since the 1960s, though its resurgence has been just since the 80s
when the modern sports and fitness craze began to catch on. Today, it is common to drink a
smoothie as a power drink or as a meal replacement. In doing so, it's important to remember that
adding supplements can give your smoothie that extra punch for energy. Jamison Starbuck,
herbalist for Better Nutrition and practicing naturopathic physician says, "As a physician, I think
smoothies with soy protein are a great energy alternative to high-fat traditional breakfasts like
bacon and eggs." Whether you drink yours for breakfast or have it as a snack, the following five
supplements are good choices for giving your smoothie an extra energy boost. They're readily

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Switchel</b></a></font><br>

 Switchel is a energy-boosting beverage originating in colonial North America, most notably New England.
 The primary ingredients were molasses, vinegar, ginger and water, though other ingredients were sometimes added. Alternative 
appelations included "Haymakers Punch," "Harvest Drink," "Harvest Beer," and "Swanky." 
 <p>
 "Switchel. [Origin unknown. A name for various intoxicating drinks.] A drink of molasses and
 water, often seasoned with vinegar and ginger, and sometimes with rum." 1790. Freneau,
 Poems (1795) 375 "For such attempts men drink your high-proof wines. Not spiritless switchel
 and vile hogo drams."...1946. Yankee August 9 "Our grandfathers would be drinking Switchel for
 refreshment: a mixture of water, ginger, molasses or vinegar, and sometimes rum."<br>
 ---<i>A Dictionary of Americanisms on Historical Principles</i>, Mitford M. Mathews editor [University of
 Chicago Press:Chicago] 1951 (p. 1695)

 "Switchel. A Colonial drink made from molasses, vinegar, and water. It is sometimes called
 "haymaker's punch." Brandy, cider, or rum was often added."<br>

 1999 (p. 320)<br> 
 <p>
 "As the time for harvesting the New England hay crops draws near, old-times are likely to sigh
 for the earlier days when every farmer was expected to "do the honors" to the men he
 employed to work in the hayfields. These consisted of sumptuous meals and plenty of switchel.
 Possibly this cooling, delectable drink is known in fields afar today, but it was originally a New
 England beverage, seldom manufactured or served except during haying. It was a concoction of
 molasses, sugar, vinegar and water, and many good farm wives had their own secret formulas.
 Some simply stirred until well blended, added ice if it were available and served. Others cooked
 the mixture and allowed it to cool naturally. Generally switchel was carried to the hayfields in one
 or two gallon stone jugs, wrapped in wet cloths and placed somewhere in the sahd. By keeping
 the cloth wet the mixture would remain cool for hours. While switchel was originally devised as a
 strictly non-alcoholic, and peculiarly cooling, drink, some farmers who believed their men cut
 more hay when warm than when cool more or less liberally fortified the contents of the jug with
 New England rum; which was cheap; pure and plentiful. Such employers had little difficulty in
 obtaining plenty of hands during haying time."<br>
 ---"Harvesting in Old New England Made Gay by Serving Switchel,"  <i>New York Times</i>, June 16,
 1929 (p. XX2)

 "Many of the large New England hayfields have disappeared; so has the switchel, which
 is now merely a name. Switchel was a mixture of molasses, ginger, water and a dash of
 vinegar, contained in a brown jug cached under the shade of a bunch of alders or partly
 submerged in a spring hole. On a hot day when men were mowing, raking, or pitching
 hay, frequent trips were made to the switchel jug. Dusty throats needed something to
 wash away the hayseed, and switchel was the answer. It was consumed in quantities.
 The coldness of the water was tempered by the molasses, while the ginger and vinegar
 prevented cramps."<br>

<i>Practical American Cookery and Domestic Economy</i>, by Miss Hall, 1855, page 117....Swanky was a seagoing switchel...Similar in purpose to modern sports drinks, it slakes thirst and provdes a bit of
sugary energy. Molasses is high in minerals as well. This recipe yields close to six gallons, which would be about right for a 
crew of people haying in summer months or a schooner full of handliners. The proportions for roughly a quart and a half are as follows:
 five cups water, half a cup of molasses, a quarter cup of vinegar, and three teaspoons of ginger. One of our testers remarked
that the swanky 'tastes like something that's good for you.' You may want to sample it after mixing and add additional water
to taste. We liked it best when the water had been doubled."<br>

Tang was trademarked in 1957 (U.S. Patent & Trademark Office registration #1974439)
and introduced to the American public in 1959. It was invented as a modern breakfast
beverage in a corporate kitchen, not commissioned by the U.S. space program. Gemini astronauts brought Tang
to outer space in 1965. In 1969, Tang went to the moon. Product popularity rocketed beyond expectations and savvy marketers
capitalized on the connection. If you remember other flavors besides classic orange, you are correct! In 1969 Tang came in 
grapefruit, pineapple-grapefruit & grape.

"General Foods Corp.'s Post division will introduce in selected test markets this September a new instant orange-flavored breakfast beverage called Tang. It is a powder which can be mixed instantly in cold water. Each serving, according to General Foods, contains more vitamins C and A than equivalent amounts of fresh or frozen orange juice. It is packed in seven and 14-ounce jars; the seven-ounce jar makes 12 individual four-ounce servings."

"A brand new product in the morning beverage field made its Washington debut at a brunch Tuesday at the Mayflower Hotel. The new instant breakfast drink, called 'Tang,' is a product of General Foods Corporation. "It contains more vitamins A and C than fresh or frozen orange juice, thereby setting off the first spark toward a brand new feeling each morning.," Fay Burnett, nutritionist for General Foods Kitchens, told newspaper, radio, TV and other guests at the Brunch. Vitamin-enriched Tang has a sunny fresh flavor and an appetizing orange color...Miss Wooden showed how Tang is made in seconds by merely mixing two rounded teaspoons of the powdered breakfast drink in a glass of cold water. It can be make as needed--by the glass, quart or more...When it is made up ahead of time, it should be stored in the refrigerator, the colder, the better flavor...And there's not separation.

"'Because of the limitations of space, only the most vital earth elements can be taken aboard.' That's not the national Aeronautics and Space Administration talking.
 It's General Foods Corp. It claims Tang is one of the those 'vital earth elements.'...Just how 'vital' such items are to the moon effort might be open to discussion. 
But they're suddenly vital to the men of Madison Avenue. A lot of companies hope to make a lot of mileage out of the fact that some everyday products will be
 going along on the trip [Apollo 11]...There's hardly a company not trying to make some hay out of its connection with the Apollo program. And some of the 
advertising tie-ins are not being received enthusiastically by NASA..."We don't encourage it. But we don't discourage it as long as the ads are factual."...According 
to Sandra Meyer, senior product manager for Tang, a musical advertisement extolling the drink's virtues has been prepared for quick substitution for the 
Apollo-related TV spots if anything goes wrong on Apollo 11. And grocery stores selling Tang have been cautioned not to use store promotions until it's clear the
 mission is successful. General Foods' newspaper ad show a moon superimposed on an all-black background. In the lower right hand corner a coupon reads: 'For
 earth people only: 12 cents off Tang." (Tang is also one-quarter sponsor of the American Broadcasting Co.'s space coverage this week at a cost of $500,000.)...
And while General Foods is saying a lot about its orange flavored Tang, it's saying a lot less about the fact the astronauts will also have the choice of grapefruit,
 pineapple-grapefruit and grape flavored versions of the drink. The company test-marketed some of these flavors with ordinary customers and decided they wouldn't sell."

<p>
"Tang Instant Breakfast Drink has gone along with our astronauts since the Gemini flights of 1965...General Foods is quick to point out that it was not it that
 approached Aeronautics and Space Administration by the other way around, and that 'there are no contacts of payments involved.' Tang just met the space food 
requirements, that's all."

<p>
<b>NASA recap</b><br>
"For the record, the drink's origin had nothing to do with the space program. It was
developed by General Foods in 1957, 12 years before man would set foot on the lunar
surface. But the Vitamin C-filled drink is indelibly tied with outer space, largely because
it has been used by astronauts since the Gemini flights of 1965 - and because of
advertising. "Tang Takes Off" bleats a 1965 General Foods newsletter that describes
the elaborate efforts to craft commercials tied to the Gemini flights. Later commercials
and ad promotions - from moon maps sent to thousands of schools to lunar module
replicas on 18-ounce Tang jars - would reinforce the Tang-Space connection for years.
Once widely popular, Tang is no longer the major player it once was.  "Its sales are not
now what they were then," said Nancy Redmond, a spokeswoman for Kraft General
Foods. She attributed that mainly to changes in consumer tastes and the availability of
other drinks. Still, Redmond said, "Tang has its dedicated users." It's also now
available in mango flavor and sugar-free orange. Plastic containers have replaced the
old glass jars. And Tang is still used regularly in space. "<br>

<a name="tequila">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Tequila</b></a></font><br>

"Tequila...its origins date to pre-Columbian times. Before the Spanish conquered Mexico, the indigenous people made a naturally 
fermented beverage called pulque from maguey plants. The Spanish transformed the fermented drink into a distilled one and created
mescal (also spelled 'mezcal'), the general category that includes tequila. For years tequila was not widely known outside Miexico
and adjacent areas of the United States. That situation changed after the Mexican government established the Norma Oficial 
Mexicana (called the Normas)...in 1978 to regulate tequila quality and consistency. According to the Normas, tequila 
must be made from the blue agave plant, a variety of the maguey plant called Agave tequilana Weber)...The plants must be grown
on the volcanic soil of Jalisco province, which includes the town of Tequila, and designated nearby areas. Tequila must contain at 
least 51 percent blue agave juice. The other 40 percent can be cane or corn syrup or juices from other varieties of agave. 
Tequila made from 100 percent blue agave is so labled."<br>

<p>
<b>Why the worm?</b><br>
"The agave plant contains a sweet sap at its heart called aquamiel ('honey water') that is made into a brandy called vino mezcal, which is tequila...Tax records of the town of 
Tequila show that Don Cenobio Sauzia shipped barrels of 'mezcal wine' to the U.S. in 1873, and American troops brought it back from their campaign against Pancho Villa in 
1916. During a gin shortage in 1944 in this country tequila enjoyed a brief popularity, but it was not until the 1960s, when it became a faddish drink among California university
students, that the sales of the spirit really grew, especially as the basis for the <a href="foodbeverages.html#margarita">Margarita cocktail</a>...The 'classic' way...to drink straight tequila, which required dried crushed
worms from the agave plant in a shake of salt, was described by Green Peyton in his book San Antonio: City in the Sun (1946)."

<a name="pulque">
<b>Pulque & mescal</b><br>
"All distilled maguey juices are mescals, a word derived from mexcalmetl, a Nauhuatl word for the agave plant...Much mescal is 
produced locally in the old-fashioned way. Mague pinas are placed in pits, covered with heated rocks and layers of fiber matting,
and then allowed to cook for several days. The process gives mescal its distinctive smoky, earthy flavor. Once cooked, the mague is 
placed in wooden barrels and allowed to ferment for up to a month. The resultant mixture of fiber and liquid is distilled 
twice...Like tequila, mescal is classified as aged or not...Probably the best known outside Mexico is mescal con gusano, sold with a
'worm' in the bottle. The 'worm' is really a larva of a moth that lives in the base of the maguey plant."<br>
<br>---<i>Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America</i>, Andrew F. Smith editor [Oxford University Press:New York] 2004, Volume 2 (p. 537)
<p>
"If food was hedged about with prohibition, fermented liquor was even more so. There was, of
course, no distilled liquor unti the arrival of the Europeans, but there were many kinds of fermented
drinks. Alcoholic liquids could be made from maize, honey, pineapples, cactus fruits, and many other
things. The most important, which we have encountered in the Aztec version of the Aztec banquet,
was pulque, a name of Antillean origin that replaces the Nahuatl uctli. It was made from certain
species of the Agave, or century plant, or maguey, a spicy rosette-forming plant which is not a
cactus, belonging to the Agavacae family. When, after years of growth, the maguey is about to shoot
up a flowering stalk, the bud is cut out and the plant produces great quantities of sweet juice for about
two months. This juice, today called aguamiel, or honeywater, can be drunk as is, boiled down to
make syrup, boiled down more to make sugar, or fermented into pilque or vinegar. Pulque could be
flavored with many roots and fruit, but the simple version is a whitish liquid with a peculiar but not
unpleasant taste. Some of the additives were reputed to make it much stronger, but without them
pulque contained only a few percents of alcohol. There are different stories as to who was permitted
to drink pulque. Cooper-Clark says that it was old men and women over seventy who had children
and grandchildren...Motolinia said it was permissible for those over fifty, because that was when the
blood turned cold, and pulque warmed it and made it easier to sleep...In any case, only a few small
cups were allowed. At weddings and certain religious festivals the young were given pulque; one
feast was even called "when the children drink pulque," but it was always in strictly limited
quantities. Drinking was acceptable, intoxication was not. Pulque drinking must have been thought of
as plebian, because Motolinia says lords, princes, and warriors made it ia point of honor not to drink
it, preferring to drink chocolate, which was the prestige drink."<br>

<b>Margaritas</b><br>
While no one questions the fact that <a href="foodbeverages.html#tequila">taquila</a> is a Mexican product, there are conflicting stories
regarding the origin of the drink called Margarita:
<p>
"The margarita, a cocktail made of tequila, triple sec, or Cointreau, and lime juice served in a
salt-rimmed glass, was popularized by Victor J. Bergeron in his chain of Senor Pico restaurants
in California during the 1960s...While Bergeron popularized the margarita, he did not invent it.
Several different origin stories for margaritas have circulated. According to Marion Gorman and
Felipe de Alba's <i>The Tequila Book</i>, one story traces the margarita to the bar at the Caliente Race
Track in Tijuana, Mexico about 1930. Another credits Dona Bertha, owner of Bertha's Bar in
Taxco, Mexico, with the invention of a drink that later evolved into the margarita. The former
Los Angeles bartender Daniel Negrete claims to have originated the cocktail in 1936 at the Garci
Crespo Hotel in Puebla, Mexico...Whatever its origins, the margarita cocktail quickly spread
throughout America during the 1960s. It became a staple of Mexican restaurants in the United
States. In Mexico, restaurants that attracted the American tourist trade adopted margaritas. From
the original margarita, Anglo tastes encouraged adaptations."<br>
---<i>Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America</i>, Andrew F. Smith editor [Oxford
University Press:New York] 2004, Volume 2 (p. 46-7)
<p>
"Margarita...there are several claims as the creation of the drink. One story traces the margarita to
the bar at the Caliente Race Track in Tijuana, Mexico, about 1930. Another credits Dona Bertha,
owner of Bertita's bar in Tasca, Mexico, as having made the drink about 1930. Former Los
Angeles bartender Daniel Negrete claims to have originated the cocktail at the Farci Crespo
Hotel in Puebla, Mexico, in 1936 and named it after a girlfriend named Margarita. Still another
story gives the credit to a San Antonio, Texas, woman, Margarita Sames, who made the drink for
houseguests in 1948 while living in Acapulco. Yet another claim pinpoints the drink's birthplace
as the Tale of the Cock Restaurant in Los Angeles about 1955 and says it was named after a
Hollywood starlet."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Tomato juice</b></a></font><br>

Andrew F. Smith, one of America's most respected and prolific food historians, launched his career studying/reporting on 
tomatoes. His first book: <i>The Tomato in America</i> [1994] is the cornerstone for all things tomato. Mr. Smith carefully/academically 
chronicles the introduction, recipe embracements, medicinal applications, social challenges and commercial successes of tomatoes 
in our country. Presumably, tomato juice descended from 19th century tomato pills & tomato syrup. These "modern" health preparations were prescribed for everyone from infants to 
infirmed requiring a serious infusion of vitamins. Decades before lycopine was discovered, medical professionals and housewives
 acknowledged the power of the tomato.
<p>
"The Campbell Soup Company's first major diversification was in tomato juice. The drinking of tomato juice was a mid-twentieth-century
phenomenon. According to several accounts, tomato juice was the creation of the American-born French Chef Louis Perrin. In 1917
he experimentally served tomato juice to his guests at a resort in French Lick Springs, Indiana. Chicago businessmen who spent
their vacations at French Lick Springs purportedly spread the word to others about the 'tomato juice cocktail in lieu of stronger
mixtures.' Although canned tomato cocktails were growing more popular by the 1920s, none of the existing products yielded juice
 with just the right color and flavor. Tomato juice cocktails were heralded during a Tri-State Packers Convention at Philadelphia;s
Adlephia Hotel in 1922. A can manufacturer served tomato juice free of charge to each participant in the annual banquet in 
hopes that canners would pack tomato juice. By this date, tomato juice was touted as a health drink and was served in hospitals. According
to Dr. Hugo Friedstein of Chicago's Children's Memorial Hospital, the vitamin content of tomato juice did 'marvelous things in 
cleansinhg the system.' Yet it was not canned commercially. The reason for the failure of canned tomato juice as that tomato solids settled
atthe bottom of the can, or the class the juice as poured into. In 1924 an Indianapolis pediatrician discussed this problem with his 
friend Ralph Kemp of Frankfort, Indiana. Kemp had majored in agricultural engineering at the University of Wisconsin and at
the time worked with his father, John Kemp, operating a canning plant. Intrigued  with the challenge, the Kemps began experimenting
to find a way to break tomato pulp into minute particles that would float in the juice. Their solution was to use a viscolizer
previously employed in the manufacture of ice cream. It required a great deal of adaption to be used successsfully canning tomato
juice. After four years of work, the Kemps finally succeeded. In 1928 they applied for a patent and initiated the first national 
advertising campaign for their tomato juice. Tomato juice was an instant hit with the American public. The Campbell Soup Company moved itno
high gear to produce its own tomato juice. Campbell converted part of Camden's Plant No. 2, built during the 1920s, for makin
tomato soup. The problem now became what tomato variety should be grown for making juice. After experimentation, a tomato was found that met the
needs. Campbell released its version of tomato juice in 1931. In 1932 Campbell launched a major marketing drive for its tomato
juice, and by 1935 30 percent of Campbell tomatoes went into making that product. By the following year, cookbooks included
recipes using Campbell's tomato juice as an ingredient. Another reason tomato juice was so succesful was the end of Prohibition. A
cocktail made of tomato juice and vodka was probably first developed at Harry's Bar in Paris by Ferdinand 'Pete" Petiot. Petiot
moved to New York in 1933 and introduced his new creation. After experimentation, he added Worcestershire sauce and called it
a Bloody Mary. Its name was supposedly derived from the British Queen Mary I, who killed many Protestants during her reign in the
mid-sixteenth century, Others claim that Mary was Petiot's girlfriend...Tomato juice was a natural addition to the Campbell Soup
Company, which had been built on the tomato. Its introduction, however, reversed the corporate decision to focus soley on 
soupmaking. The implications of this trend would not be felt for decades. Shortly after World War II ended, Campbell Soup
Company made another logical addition when it purchased V8 juice from Standard Brands."<br>

"Twenty-five years ago this month, canned tomato juice was introduced to consumers. It appeared after four years of proccessing
research by the kemp Brothers Packing Comapny of Frankfort, Ind., which had in mind the development of a new baby food. But the 
infants turned out to be a minor market as compared with the appeal  'liquid tomato' had on the general trade in groceries and on 
restaurants. From the pack of about 1,5000,000 cases in 1930, tomato juice has swelled to an output that this year is expected to toatl 28,500,000
cases. The United States Department of Agriculture found a few years ago that this juice was purchased more often than any other
 canned single-strength juice. About 44 per cent of the famlies in the United States bought it. The success story of this product
stems not only form its attractive tang and tint, but also from the fact that canned tomato juice is both cheap and high in 
nutrients. At a current cost of 29 cnets for a forty-six ounce can, the juice costs about 2 1/2 cents for a half-cup serving. This
quantity supplies aobut a fourth of the Vitamin A and C needs of the physically active amn....Largely consumed exclusively
in this country (a little is exported to Cuba and Canada), tomat juice is primarily a berverage. But, on occasion, it supplies the 
liquid for an aspic, is heated to provide a bracing hot soup...and takes the place of other liquids in cheese soufles, main dish 
dumplings and meat stews."<br>

<a name="ice">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Ice</b></a></font><br>
Food historians tell us hunter-gatherers inhabiting northern regions used ice for storage and food
preservation. This was a matter of practicality, not choice. Cooled drinks and frozen desserts,
such as lemonade, iced tea, and flavored ices, were enjoyed by upper-class ancient civilizations.
Both lemons and tea are "Old World" foods. Early records of consumption place the origins of
these drinks in the Mediterranean regions and Asia, respectively. These beverages were
introduced to America by European settlers. Economics of the Ice trade expanded the markets for
cold drinks in the mid-nineteenth century. <a href="foodbeverages.html#lemonade">Lemonade</a> and <a href="foodbeverages.html#icedtea">iced tea</a> (along with several other
popular food innovations) are sometimes touted as having been "invented" at the St. Louis
Exposition in 1904. This is not true. Culinary evidence confirms both were known long before
that year. Their rise to popularity in our country  is sometimes attributed to the Temperance
(anti-alcohol) Movement of the late 19th/early 20th centuries. 
<p>
"Storing food and drink in low temperatures is an ancient practice The cold air of a natural cave
or the cool environment of a well-insulated underground pit or chamber worked as natural
refrigerators for grains and root crops. Furthermore, just as hunters on the arid plains found their
kill would dry out in the sun, so hunters of the icebound regions must have discovered that meat
left in the snow or freezing, icy winds would also keep, at least until it thawed. Keeping food cool
slows down the bacterial action in food, thereby helping the food stored safely for longer, a
process now known as refrigeration. Microoganisms do not like the cold. It slows down their
metabolism and makes them sluggish, unable to reproduce...freezing does not actually destroy the
organism; it merely puts them into a chilling limbo until they and the food they inhabit are
defrosted. While the hunter may have temporarily lost some meat in the freezing snow, he might
also have buried some "overkill" of meat or fish in the ground to hide it from predators or rival
hunting parties....Sometimes, where the right conditions were available, the technique developed
of freezing food to preserve it....In...northern regions, food became frozen unavoidably, and the
fact that the food was preserved was a fortunate by unsought side effect...
      "In warmer regions, ice was only used for cooling, although people have enjoyed chilled
drinks and cooled food in the most unlikely places. Ice pits and icehouses were known to have
been built in Mesopotamia almost four thousand years ago, and the powerful and wealthy men
and women of Persia, Egypt, Rome, and Greece were accustomed to being served cold drinks and
chilled fruits even in the hottest weather. Alexander the Great ordered trenches to be dug at Petra,
filled with winter snow, and covered with oak branches so that his soldiers could drink cooled
wine in summertime. As well as chilling drinks, snow and ice were also used by physicians to treat
patients with fever, inflammation, and stomach complaints. So all around the Mediterranean, snow
was collected from the mountains and carried down to the cities, where it was sold daily or stored
in ice houses. The snow was packed hard into pits and covered with branches, straw, leaf mats, or
coarse cloth. The Chinese...were harvesting and storing ice by at least 1100 B.C....Sometimes the
ice had to travel many miles. Thirteenth- and fourteenth-century Egyptian royalty had their ice
shipped from the mountains of Lebanon all the way to Cairo...Like sugar, ice became a part of the
fabulous sparkling jewelery of banquets, with centerpieces of elaborate ice sculptures, sugar
trifoni, chilly jellies, iced sherberts, and glass or silver bowls of ice-encrusted fruits...By the
sixteenth century numerous palaces, estates, chateaux, abbeys, and monestaries throughout
Europe, the Middle east, and China had their own icehouses. Soon, anyone with aspirations to
elegant living had ice or snow houses built, and by the eighteenth century many of these had
acquired architectural pretentions, with Gothic arches or Grecian pillars...The basic
construction...changed little up to the nineteenth century...But ice was not just the preserve of the
rich; in some parts of Europe the peasants erected simple ice stacks made from branches, heather,

Although icehouses were principally used for storing ice rather than for preserving food, they
gradually came to be seen as useful refrigerators for food...The increasing demand for clean,
good-quality ice opened an important new market. In Europe, when a mild winter failed to
produce ice, people had to look north, to Greenland and Norway...In nineteenth-century Paris and
London, cooks, confectioners, butchers, fishmongers, and wine merchants all rushed to buy from
ship bringing cargoes of ice form the "Greenland seas." Ice harvesting was a dangerous
business...competition...soon began flooding the market..."<br>

"Ice has been used to preserve food and cool beverages for thousands of years. Wealthy
Europeans brought their appreciation of icy desserts and iced drinks with them to the New World.
Archaeolgists at Jamestown, Virginia, found ice pits dating from as early as the seventeenth
century. The colonists cut ice from ponds, lakes, and rivers during the winter and stored it in
caves and underground cellars to last through the hot summer months. In the eighteenth century,
icehouse, which are more efficient than cellars, provided cold storage, as well as preserving ice for
chilling food and drink and making ice cream. Ice was advertised for sale in Philadelphia
newspapers as early as 1784, and Europeans visiting Philadelphia and Baltimore in the 1790s
reported that Americans drank water with ice and that containers of ice were used to cool hotel
rooms. The first recorded cargo of ice was shipped from New York to Charleston, South
Carolina, in 1799, and between 1805 and 1860 Frederick Tudor, a Boston merchant, grew rich
shipping harvested ice from Massachusetts ponds overseas. Tudor, known as the Ice King,
promoted the construction and use of ice chests, sent agents to help establish businesses selling
ice cream, extolled the virtues of ice for preserving food, and promoted the sale of carbonated
water, which he thought tasted better cold. He even offered bar owners free ice for a year if they
agreed to sell iced drinks at the same price as warm ones."<br>

Have you ever wondered why wine bottles are shaped the way they are? Why are some different sizes & colors? 
The history of wine containers is a study in human techonology, economics, and politics. Salud! 
<p>
"Today it may be taken for granted that wine bottles of different colours and shapes will hold a precise capacity. Nor is it questioned that a paper label will be firmly 
fixed to the bottle to give a plethora of information, much of it required by law. These are recent developments. In classical antiquity wine was stored and transported in large, 
long jars called amphorae. They varied considerably in size but it would certainly be difficult to pour a drinking quantity form such an awkward and big vessel, without using some sort of 
intermediate container. The Romans invented the technique of blowing glass bottles and some of these may well have been used to serve wine. Pottery and stoneware jugs 
were used for centuries in Europe for serving wine, but glass took over as technology to make glass in commercial quantities spread in the 17th century, and by the end of it 
glass bottles were plentiful, although reserved for the upper classes. Shape. Early bottles have more or less globular bodies with long conical necks. The form developed... 
becoming lower and wider in Britain, while on mainland Europe the flask-shape with an oval cross-section was popular. From c. 1690 to 1720, the outline of a bottle 
resembled that of an onion--a wide compressed globlular body with a short neck. Larger bottles were made too, whose shape resembled an inflated balloon or 
bladder...By the 1720s the 'onion' became taller and the sides flatter...Naturally occurring impurities in the constituent ingredients gave glass an olive green hue which varied from pale 
to almost black and was beneficial to the bottled wine as it excluded light. Most bottles had an applied ring of glass just below the neck which gave an anchorage to the string used 
to hold in a variety of stoppers...Wine drinkers made an important discovery in the 1730s. While it was known that some vintages of wine were better than others even in 
prehistory, their keeping and consequent maturing qualities were not realized until the introduction of binning, the storing of wines in bottles laid on their sides...In 1821 
Rickets of Bristol patented a machine for moulding bottles of uniform size and shape...Thus the modern wine bottle had evolved...From 1636, at about the time of the first 
appearance of glass bottles in post-Roman Britain, it was illegal to sell wine by the bottle. The consumer protection measure was on account of vintner's willingness to take 
advantage of the varying capacity of blown bottles. From that time and for the next 230 years, wine was sold by the measure and then bottled. Customers who bought 
regularly had their own bottles and had them marked in order to distinguish them from any other that might be at the vintner's premises waiting to be filled. The usual marking was the 
attachment at the end of the production process of a disc seal of the same glass as the bottle, upon which was impressed the owner's initials, name, or heraldic device, often 
accompanied by the date, Innkeepers and taverners had appropriately marked, or 'sealed', bottles too. It may be noted here that these seals did not indicate contents... 
Bottles with paper labels indicating the contents, first had written and later printed, emerged during the opening years of the 19th century, but in Britain the law 
prohibiting wine from being sold by the bottle was not relaxed until 1860... 
The size and shape of early bottles was, to an extent, a hit and miss affair. Perhaps the 'standard' size was the natural result 
of a lungful of air, but bottles were made in a variety of sizes from early times." <br>

<b>When did the large format bottle names begin?</b> <br>
English language history source generally agree on the the 19th century. Entries in the Oxford English Dictionary 
suggest these names were not codified by one person at a specific time. They evolved. The earliest print reference cited by 
<i>The Oxford English Dictionary</i> for Rehoboam
dates to 1841. Note: this <i>OED</i> definition does not specify bottle dimension or volume. Later definitions sometimes reference bottle size.

<b>USA wine bottle sizes & standardization</b><br>
Our survey of late 19th/early 20th century USA wine ads and menus offers regular references to bottled wine being sold in quarts and pints. Menus include both domestic and
imports but don't dwell on bottle sizes. In fact? The difference between domestic and European wine bottle sizes quietly ferments until the early 1970s.

"Bottles are containers in which to store and carry liquids. The earliest bottles were made of skins sewed together, but the Ancients also had bottles made of stone, 
alabaster, glass, ivory, horn, silver, and common earthenware. Modern wine-bottles are made of glass composed chiefly of silica, soda and lime in varying 
proportion. The shades of green of wine-bottles, other than plain white ones, are imparted by iron oxide. Quart and pint bottles must, by law, contain a fourth and an eighth 
of a gallon, but the actual liquid contents of bottles, half-bottles or quarter-bottles are not legally defined, a fact taken advantage of by some unscrupulous dealers in wine. 
According to current commercial usage, wine-bottles should never appreciably vary from the accepted standard of contents of 26 3/2 fluid ounces per 
reputed quart, or 6 quarts to the gallon, equal to 4 imperial quarts of 40 fluid ounces each. The more usual names of bottles in Great Britain, besides half-bottles and 
quarter-bottles are the magnum (two bottles), double-magnum (four bottles), tappit-hen (three imperial quarts), imperial pint (three-quarters of the reputed quart or ordinary 
bottle). <br>

"The size of wine bottles could become the next addition to the growing list of trade disputes between the European Common Market and the United States. France has asked the 
commission of the six-nation unit to protest the the United States about a proposal put forward by the California Wine Institute that would forbid the import of wine into 
America in bottles not of standard Americans sizes. The French and their Common Market partners say that the move is an attempt by the California wine industry to 
hamper their European competitors, who in 1969 sold $64.5-million of wine to the United States, almost all of it in the standard 70-centiliter 
European bottle." <br>

"You wander into your favorite wine shop to pick up a bottle for dinner. On one shelf rests a nice Cabernet Sauvignon from California for $3.50. Nearby, however, is 
a bottle of French wine at the same price. You cogitate for awhile and finally opt for the import. But which bottle really gives you your money's worth? Quality 
aside, the answer is the California wine, simply because the bottle undoubtedly is bigger. At first glance, you might think the California winemakers would be proud 
to give the consumer more for his money. You're wrong. The difference in sizes has raised the hackles of many vintners hereabouts who are crying unfair competition for 
themselves and misleading packaging for the consumer...At issue are U.S. regulations which tightly control the bottle sizes for wine produced in this country but not for 
imports...As such, the standard bottle size for U.S. wine is a fifth of a gallon, or 25.6 ounces. But in Europe, which is on the metric system, the standard size is only about 
23.66 ounces, often cited on labels as 1 pint, 8 ounces. This means that a 12-bottle cause of domestic wine would equal about 13 bottles of imported. Moreover... 
wines from around the world flow into the U.S. is 'a bewildering number of sizes.'...As the Wine Institute sees it the problems is two-fold. First, wine is taxed on a gallon basis. So, a 
bottle of imported wine is taxed a smaller dollar amount right here in the U.S. than its domestic counterpart...Obviously, vintners might feel they're being placed at a 
disadvantage in their own market. Also, some contend, consumer assume they're getting a full fifth of wine when buying an import rather than a smaller bottle even 
though the quantity is listed on the label. Fueling this notion...is the fact many imports have push-up bottoms which take up space and make the bottle seem bigger...For...the 
Wine Institute, the solution is simple: Make all wine sold in the U.S. conform to the same regulations, in this case the standards now applied to 
U.S. wine...But assuming the problem does exist, is this the correct answer? Some voices within the California wine industry say 'No...there is a good case for the adoption of 
the metric system by the United States." <br>

"For years, American winemakers have battled--unsuccessfully--to force European vintners to bottle their wine according the 
United States standards of fill: pints, quarts and gallons. Recently, in a dramatic turnaround, the powerful California 
Wine Institute proposed that Americans switch to the metric system. At their winter meeting in Palm Springs last month, the 
institute's directors voted unanimously to create a special board to study adoption of the metric system. As reported in Wines 
& Vines, a trade publication, the directors even came up with a list of possible bottle sizes: quart-liter, half-liter, 
three-quarter-liter, liter, two-, three and four-liter. Traditionally, the California Wine Institute has opposed the increasing number of 
imports being sold in this country in bottles resembling the standard fifth of a gallon. Several years ago, a representative 
of the institute charged that many foreign wines arrived in bottles closely resembling American ones but containing 5 to 10 per cent 
less. A 'fifth' of wine or Scotch or anything else is supposed to contain 25.6 ounces of liquid...Frank Schoonmaker, one of the most 
famous Americans in the wine world, defended the Europeans...[he] voiced particular concern for older wines, many of which 
had been aging for years. To transfer them to new bottles, 'in nine cases out of ten, would destroy their value and render them 
unsalable.' He pointed out too, that the typical European bottles 'have been used abroad since long before the first 
vineyard was planted in California.' What's more, Mr. Schoonmaker continued, 'The idea that American drinkers of imported wine-- 
a reasonably literate segment of our population, one might suppose--are confused and cheated by 'nonstandard' bottles... 
is laughable.' That may be true. At the same time, the profusion of bottle sizes now coming into this country is almost 
bound to be confusing to anyone concerned with just how much wine he is getting for his money. The traditional French wine bottles 
contain 75 centiliters. That is true both of the slab-sided round-shouldered bordeaux bottle and the gently-sloped burgundy 
bottle, both of which are widely imitated in this country and around the world. The 75-centiliter bottle holds 25.36 ounces, a 
mere fraction less than the American 'fifth.' But there has been a trend, particularly in France, to switch to a slightly smaller 
bottle, holding 72 centiliters. Only the most practiced eye can spot these smaller bottles on a wine shop shelf and in many cases, 
the labels on the 75-centiliter bottles and the labels on the 72-centiliter bottles are identical; they both say either 1 pint, 8 
ounces or 3/4 ths of a quart. To complicate things, the Alsatians prefer a bottle that holds 24.5 ounces; there are German 
wines that hold 23.5 ounces, and other European wines ranging anywhere form 22 ounces up. There is also a 'pot' bottle that is 
actually about 50 centiliters--less than a 'fifth' but slightly more than a pint. One importer here predicted that the 
75-centiliter bottle would eventually become a collector's item." <br>

"The wine industry will lead the United States into the metric system. And while it's about it, bury an old bone of contention between U.S. and foreign producers. The 
Treasury announced Tuesday in Washington that domestic and imported wines must be bottled in seven standard metric sizes beginning in 1979. This will be the 
earliest conversion date for any U.S. industry. The changeover will reduce the number of domestic wine bottle sizes to seven from 16 and the number of imported sizes to 
seven from 27...Robert M. Ivie, chairman of the board of the Wine Institute in San Francisco and a member of the metric conversion committee, said, 'California 
and imported wine will be sold in the same sized bottles, making price comparisons simpler.'...Ivie said the Treasury ruling is the result of five years of planning and 
negotiation between the European Economic Community member nations and the U.S. wine industry. Part of the problem was getting a standard size measure within 
Europe itself...Roy Camozzi, an attorney for the Wine Institute, pointed out that it will be many years before the last of the 'old' size bottles is seen in the market place because many 
wines are aged in the bottle for long periods before sale. The changes from the present sizes used by U.S. wine producers are actually slight. The U.S. fifth contains 
25.6 ounces, which will become 3/4 liter, or 25.4 ounces, in the metric size. The changes for foreign producers will be somewhat greater since thy previously have been 
exporting bottles of 21, 22 or 24 ounces. The U.S. gallon and half-gallon sizes will be eliminated. California vintners Tuesday were generally pleased by the ruling, seeing 
little extra cost except that for the original new glass moulds. And they expect this to be made up by the slight reduction in taxes even though few believe the lower taxes will 
last. The changes from the present sizes used by U.S. producers: <br>

jeroboam 102.4 3 litres 101.4 <br>
magnum 51.2 1 1/2 litres 50.7 <br>
quart 32 1 litre 33.6 <br>

"Bringing the United States into conformity with the rest of the world, most of which operates on the metric system rather than the Imperial (British) or U.S. Customary 
systems, has been an uphill fight...Consumers are understandably reluctant to switch from a system of weights and measures they understand to one that reads like a 
foreign language to them...John Bing of San Diego...writes 'While shopping the other day, I came across something that illustrates why many consumers have 
misgivings about the coming age of the metric system in the United States. The California wine industry is converting to metric measures and the 'new size' bottles are 
beginning to appear on some dealers's shelves...half-gallon bottles of popular jug wines that sold statewide for $2.29 are being replaced by 1.5-liter bottles-- 
containing roughly 13 ounces less-that also sell for $2.29. Or, to put it another way, this is a markup of about 20% over the fair-graded half-gallon
 price." <br>
