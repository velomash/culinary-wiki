chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry ice cream. On either side of the chocolate ice cream place a
nabisco wafer for forward ends of the air ship, and in the strawberry ice cream stick a nabisco
wafer to represent the tail piece of the machine. On the chocolate ice cream place a red cherry to
represent a man riding in the air ship. Between the scoopfuls of ice cream sprinkle crushed
cherries
and pineapple, and top with chopped pecans and whipped cream. "Has sold well to students of the
University at 20c," writes the author of the formula. (M.C. Thurber.)"<br>

Under this amusing name are sold the delicious small rolls, so dainty and fine, and which are
served in all our Creole homes and restaurants. The rolls are joined together lightly in long rows
of about eight inches in length. They are brought to the doors by the bakers every morning in this
old French city. The dough for "Bullfrogs" is just the same as that for the Brioche, only a half
pound of the flour is used, instead of a pound, and a cup of butter. Bake in the same manner.
They are delightful accompaniments to the most recherche breakfast."<br>
