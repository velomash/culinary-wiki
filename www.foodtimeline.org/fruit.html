<b><a name="fruitorvegetable">What's the difference between fruits & vegetables?</b><br>
Excellent question with several answers. The "correct answer" depends upon who you ask: botanist, linguist, culinary 
professional, legal professional average or consumer. Period and place also matter. In the most general terms, vegetable
is the broader term, encompassing all edible plant matter. Fruit is a subset of this larger group. In practice, definitions
fall in two camps:<br>
<b>1.</b> Scientific classification...fruits are result in flowers, or have pits/seeds/stones.<br>
<b>2.</b> Culinary application...vegetables are part of the main meal (savory) & fruits are dessert (sweet).<br>
Botanically speaking, tomatoes (eggplants, cucumbers, melons, squash, peas, beans) are fruits. Culinary applications reasonably 
argue these plants are vegetables. Major culinary texts/cookbooks through time don't bother offering definitions.
We have to think there is some wisdom in that.
<p>
<b>Historic fruit/vegetable defintions through time</b>
<p>
<b>[1755]</b><br> 
<b>"Fruit.</b> 1. The product of a tree or plant in which the sees are contained."<br> 
<b>"Vegetable.</b> Anything that has growth without sensation, as plants. Vegetables are organized bodies consisting of various parts, containing vessels furnished with different juices; and taking in their nourishment from without, usually by means of a root, by which they are fixed to the earth, or to some body, as in the generality of plants, sometimes by means of pores distributed over the whole surface, as in sub-marine plants."<br> 
---<i>Dictionary of the English Language</i>, Samuel Johnson, facsimile 1755 edition [AMS Press:New York] 1967 (unpaged) 
<p>
<b>[1884]</b><br>
Mrs. Lincon's <i>Boston Cook Book</i> offers a chapter titled "Fruit" with some general serving notes and recipes. She does not define fruit but she does
list examples: Apples, Oranges, Grapes, Bananas, Peaches, Srtawberries, Currants, Watermelons, Pineapples, Raisins, Pears, Quinces, Rhubarb,
Prunes, Cranberries, Huckleberries, Currants, Crab-Apples, Grapes, Damsons or Greengages, Rapsberries, Blackberries, Cherries" (p. 391-403)

<b>[1911]</b><br> 
<b>"Fruit</b>...it its widest sense, any product of the soil that can be enjoyed by man or animals...Between this wide and frequently figurative use of the word and its application in the strict botanical sense treated below, there is a popular meaning, regarding the objects denoted by the word entirely from the standpoint of edibility, and differentiating them roughly from those other products of the soil, which, regarded similarly, are known as vegetables. In this sense, 'fruit' is applied to such seed-envelopes of plants as are edible, either raw or cooked, and are usually sweet, juicy or of a refreshing flavour. But applications of the word in this sense are apt to be loose and shifting according to the fashion of the time. Fruit, in the botanical sense, is developed from the flower as the result of fertilization of the ovule. After fertilization various changes take place in the parts of the flower...In popular language, the fruit includes all those parts which exhibit a striking change as the result of fertilization. In general, the fruit is not ripened unless fertilization has been effected; but cases occur as the result of cultivation in which the fruit swells and becomes to all appearances perfect, while no seeds are produced. Thus, there are seedless oranges, grapes and pineapples. When the ovules are unfertilized, it is common to find that the ovary withers and does not come to maturity; but in the case of bananas, plantains and breadfruit, the...development of seeds seems to lead to a larger growth and a greater succulence of the fruit."<br> 
<b>"Vegetable</b>...as a general term from plants, and specifically, in language, of such plants as can be eaten by man...whether cooked or raw, and whether the whole or cuch are edible,or only the leaves of the roots or tubers, such edible or culinary plants or portions of plants, a distinction is made popularly between 'fruits' and 'vegetables,'..."<br>

<b>"Fruit.</b> 1. In the widest sense, any product of plant growth useful to man or woman, as grain, vegetable, cotton, flax, etc., 2. The edible, more or less succulent, product of a perennial or woody plant, consisting of the ripened seeds and adjacent tissues, or of the latter also. In popular usage, there is no exact distinction between a fruit and a vegetable, except there the latter consists of the them, leaves, and root of the plant. Thus, the apple, pear, orange, lemon, peach, plum, grape, banana, persimmon pineapple, and most berries are generally recognized as fruits; the pea, bean, pumpkin, squash, eggplant, cucumber, etc., are vegetables; while the tomato, melon and rhubarb are variously regarded." (p. 1014)<br> 
<b>Vegetable.</b> A plant; specif. , in common usage, a herbaceous plant cultivated for food, as the cabbage, turnip, potato, bean, etc.; also the edible part or parts of such plants, as prepared for market or table. There is no well-drawn distinction between vegetables and fruits...in the popular sense; but it has been held by the courts that all those which, like potatoes, carrots, peas, celery, lettuce, tomatoes, etc. are eaten (whether cooked or raw) during the principal part of the meal are to be regarded as vegetable, while those used only for dessert are fruits."

"Fruit. Botanically, a fruit is a mature ovary of a flower. It contains the seed or seeds. it may or may not be edible, juicy, fleshy, or quite dry. Fruits come in many forms; some of the most familiar are achenes, berries, capsules, nuts, and pods. Some plant parts commonly called fruits, such a s blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, and pineapples, are really conglomerates of numerous little fruits each developed from a separate ovary.

<b>"Vegetable</b> took on its current sense just a few centuries ago, and essentially means a plant materials that is neither fruit nor seed. <b>So what is a fruit?</b> The word has both a technical and a common meaning. Beginning in the 17th century, botanists defined it as the organ that develops from the flower's ovary and surrounds the plant's seeds. But in common usage, seed-surrounding green beans, eggplants, cucumbers, and corn kernels are called vegetables, not fruits. Even the United States Supreme Court has preferred the cook's definition over the botanists. In the 1890s, a New York food importer claimed duty-free status for a shipment of tomatoes, arguing that tomatoes were fruits, and so under the regulations of the time, not subject to import fees. The customs agent ruled that tomatoes were vegetables and imposed a duty. A majority of the Supreme Court decided that tomatoes were 'usually served at dinner in, with, or after the soup, fish, or meat, which constitute the principal part of the repast, and not, like fruits, generally as dessert.'"<br>

<a name="apples">
<font color="#003366" size="+2"><b>Apples</b></font><br>
Wild apples grew in prehistoric times. Food historians generally agree they originated in the
Caucauses. The fruit was introduced to Europe by the Roman legions. They were actively cultivated. Apples are considered one of America's symbols
because they are prominently featured in recipes throughout our nation's history. Apple origins and dispersion is generally
revealed through archaolgica, rather than etymological, evidence. This is because early words denoting round tree fruit
did not necessarily distinguish between specific fruits and varieties. <a href="fruit.html#crabapples">Crab apples</a> are said to be the
ancestor of cultivated appples.
<p>
"Of the tree fruits, the apple is known to have been widely cultivated from an early date. The wild varieties were also much in demand
by early peoples, carbonized apples from about 6500BC have been found at Catal Huyuk in Anatolia. The Swiss prehistoric lake-dwellings
revealed not only large quantities of sour crabs which seem to have been a very important food at the time, but also larger ones
which appear to have been of a cultivated variety. These were mainly cut into two pieces, which suggests that they were dried, while the
smaller ones were left whole...The apple seems to be indigenous mainly in the area extending through Anatolia to parts of 
Persia, and we know that the Hittites cultivated apple-trees at an early date. Apples were grown in Mesopotamia, and in Egypt; Ramesses II
(early thirteenth century BC) had apple-trees planted in gardens laid out in the Nile delta...From Greece we have no
archaeological evidence to show how early they were used, but the classical writers make it clear that by Homeric times
orchard husbandry and gardening were well established. Theophrastus knew two apple varieties...by Pliny's time about thirty-six
kinds of apple were known, and certain long-keeping ones selected for storing."<br>

"Apple, tree fruit important in ancient food and religion. Wild apples (crab-apples) of the
European wild species gradually spread from northern Anatolia after the last ice age. Apples
were in due course transplanted, or grown from seed, far to the south of their native habitat, in
Mesopotamia in particular, where strings of sliced dried apples are described in literary sources
and have been found by archaeologists. In the Near East in the third and second millennia BC the
apple was important in cookery, in medicine and also in love charms. There is no evidence that
grafting was known at that period, and it is not known at what date cultivated apple varieites of
modern type spread westwards from Cental Asia, where they originate. In Greece the apple was a
typical orchard fruit, at least from the <i>Odyssey</i> (c.700 BC) onwards..."<br>

"The large, sweet apple familiar in modern times is essentially a cultivated product, much
changed from the tiny, sour fruits, such as those of the crabapple, which were its wild
ancestors...The original wild crabapple of Europe...is not the direct ancestor of the cultivated
apple...The main ancestor of the modern apple was M. Pumila var mitis, a native of the Caucasus
where it still grown wild. Early, small, apples were pale green, yellow, or red and consisted principally of core, the part of the
apple which is sueful for the tree's reproduction..The first written mentions of apples, in Homer's <i>Odyssey</i>, is not
specific, since the Greek would melon is used for almost any kind of round fruit which grows on
a tree. In later Greek writings a distinction was based between the apple and the related quince, which had been browing in the E. 
Mediterranean region before the arrival of the apple...The Bible is not specific about the nature of the tree of the knowledge of good and 
evil. The notion that it was an apple came much later, possibly because of the high opinion of the apple which was general in 
Roman times...The Romans considered the apple a luxury fruit...After the fall of the Roman Empire the
cultivation of apples lapsed into dissaray...apples continued to be brown, and certain distinct
types were recognized...Grafting was reintroduced and became systematic by the 16th
century."<br>

"The Romans introduced new economic plants. They had already developed several apple
varieties, with fruits smaller than those of today but larger and sweeter than those borne by
Britain's indigenous wild crabs...Their apple varieties included types for good keeping, and villa
owners stored them spread out in rows in a dry, well-ventilated loft...Apples were sliced into two
or three pieces with a red or bone knife (since metal stained the fruit), and were put to lie in the
sun."(p. 325-6)..."One of the earliest named apples was the pearmain, recorded soon after 1200.
The copstard, a very large apple, was popular from the thirteenth to the seventeenth centuries. It
was sold in the streets fo London by costermongers...By the fifteenth century pippins,
pomewaters, bittersweets and blanderelles had become fashionable apple varieties. Several of the
medieval apples were good keeping types; indeed, apples were preferred when they had been
kept awhile and allowed to mellow." (p. 330-1)...Apples were pulped in the mortar and then put

"Peregrine White, the first child of English parents born in New England (on the <i>Mayflower</i>, as it sat in Cape Cod harbor in 
November 1620)planted an apple orchard from seed when he was twenty-eight
years old. By this time, there were many apple orchards in the Masachusetts Bay and Plymouth colonies. The array of fruit and vegetable
seeds stowed in the first ships had...included apple seeds...the first apple orchard in the Massachusetts Bay region had been planted even before
organized settlement began--in 1625 on a slope of what was to become Becon Hill in Boston by the clergyman William Blaxton.
According to Ann Leighton, 'the first universally recognized New England apple' was the Blaxton's Yellow Sweeting...
John Chapman (1774-1845) from Leominster, Massachusetts, better known...as Johnny Appleseed. By the late 1790s, Chapman had established
a apple tree nursery in northrwestern Pennsylvania and central Ohio and eastern Indiana, 'shrewdly judging along what routes 
pioneers would be likely to settle and planting apple seedlings just ahead of settlements which wich homesteaders coudl start their own

In 1524, Verazzano, on the coast of what is supposed to be the present Massachusetts, mentions apples bu we know not to what fruit he could
have referred. Apple seeds were in the Memorandum of 1629 of seeds to be sent the Massachusetts Company. In 1642, Peregrin White...
planted apples at Marshfield. In 1639, Josselyn was treated with 'half a score very fair apples' from Governor's Island in 
Boston Harbor, though there was then 'not one apple tree nor pear tree planted yet in no part of the country but upon that
island.' In 1635, at Cumberland, Rhode Island, a kind called Yellow Sweeting was originated. In 1635, as Josselyn states, Mr. 
Wolcott, a distinguished Connecticut magistrate, wrote that he made 'five hundred hogshead of cider' out of his own orchard in one year and yet this was not more than
five years after his colony was planted...In Downing's <i>Fruits</i>, edition of 1866, some 643 varieties are noticed."<br>

<a name="gooseberries">
<font color="#003366" size="+2"><b>Gooseberries</b></font><br>
How the gooseberry got its name is a true etymological puzzle. We find the same plethora of origin accounts published in respected reference sources. When this
 happens, we embrace the stories. Makes the fruit even more intriguing, yes? 
<p>
"Gooseberry comes under the name of Currant or Curran, but may here obtain a word or two for itself. It is known in some of the English shires under the name Carberry, because 
it is red, or was known chiefly as red; of Feaberry, because it was deemed good for fevers: why it has been called Gooseberry is not so clear. The older herbalists always 
insisted that it was so called because it was used as a sauce for goose; and the analogy of wineberry and feaberry would see to bear them out. If this should not be satisfactory, we have to fall 
back upon the old English gorst, in modern English gorse, in Shakespeare, goss; an etymology which will at the same time account for the Scottish name of the berry, which varies between 
groset and grosart. The Scotch, it must be remembered, are great in gooseberries. It is a northern fruit. When there was not a tree nor a shrub to be found in the Shetland islands and 
the Orkneys, there were gooseberries in abundance...The gooseberry in cookery is used as a fruit pie; as a sauce for mackerel; and as Gooseberrry Fool. This last word does not 
mean a fool, but comes from the French fouler, to crush." <br>
---<i>Kettner's Book of the Table</i>, E.S. Dallas, facsimile 1877 edition prefaced by Derek Hudson [Centaur Press Ltd.:London] 1868 (p. 220-221) 
<p>
"Gooseberries...The origin of its name is far from clear. The fact that in Tudor and Elizabethan times gooseberries were frequently used in stuffing geese makes it more likely than not that the word 
is simply a compound of goose and berry (it first appeared in print in 1532). However, it is also possible that it may have been an adaptation of French groseille, which was certainly 
borrowed into English in the 1500s and survived for several centuries, in Scotland and northern England as groser or groset and in other local areas as grozell. What does seem clear is that 
before the name gooseberry was adopted, the fruit was called thevethorn (a word applied originally, in Anglo-Saxon times, to the 'bramble'), and that thevethorn survived dialectally 
well into the nineteenth century, both as theabe, thepe, and thape in Scotland, Yorkshire, and East Anglia and in the slightly altered forms feaberry and dayberry. The 
humorous alternative name goosegog seems to have started life as yet another dialectal variant: it is first recorded in the glossaries of East Anglian words in the early 
nineteenth century." <br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 144-145) 
<p>
"The origin of the gooseberry (Ribes grossularia...) and that of its name, is something of a mystery. The one that is cultivated is a Eurasian native that was 
apparently brought too France by the Normans in the tenth century. There--because it was made into a sauce to go with mackerel--the berry came to be known as groseille a 
maquereau ("currant for the mackerel"). The English name is thought to have been the result of using the berry to stuff roasted goose and accompanying the fish with a relish 
of gooseberries as well." <br>
---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kenneth F. Kiple and Kriemhild Conee Ornelas [Cambridge University Press:Cambridge] 2000 Volume Two (p. 1779)
<p>
"As for the English name, Johnson (1847) has a theory: 'Dr. Martyun considers the name was applied to this fruit, in consequence of its being employed as a saute for that bird. It is somewhat unfortunate for this derivation that it never been so used. It seems to me most probalby to be a corruption from the Dutch name Kruisbes, or Gruisbes, derived from Kruis, the Cross, and Bes, as Berry, becasue the fruit was ready for sue just after the Festival of the Invention of the Holy Cross; just as Kruissharing, in Dutch, is herring, caugth after the same festival.' The <i>OED</i> (<i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>...adheres to the derivation from goose, in favour of which it may be said that the sharpness of the gooseberry goes weil with a fatty or oily emeat (e.g. goose ro mackerel)."<br>

<b>Gooseberry symbolism & lore</b><br>
"Gooseberries grew wild in Europe long ago, and it appears that the Europeans didn't begin to cultivate them before the 
sixteenth century. If the Greeks and Romans knew of them, they left nothing in their literature to indicate it...the 
Europeans used to say that babies were born under gooseberry bushes--a belief that might have originated farther east, in 
Iran. Scholars do find mention of gooseberries in legends from lands to the east of Europe; but currants--close relatives of gooseberries--also grow in the East where they seem tp have acieived amore prominent place in myth. According to the Iranian legend, the first humans come from a currant bush...Similarly Hindus held the Indian gooseberry bush sacred. In legend, the bush grew from the tears of two goddesses, Parvati and Lakshmi, who wanted so desperately to offer somethign new to Lord Shiva that they cried in frustration and the tree sprang up from their tears to provide an offering. The Sanskirt name for the Indian gooseberry is dhatrica or dhatri, which meant nurturing mother."

<b>What is a grape & where did it originate?</b><br>
  "Botanically, the grape is a berry of any species of Vitis, the genus of the vine family that
  was growing wild over much of the earth long before there were humans about. In North
  America, the vines evolved toward the species V. Labrusca--the fox grape, one variety of
  which is the Concord grape. But practically all of the world's wine comes from varieties
  of a single Old World species, V. Vinifera--the vine that bears wine. It is though to have
  originated in Asia Minor and, as people early discovered (to their delight) that grapes and
  their juice ferment, has been cultivated for some 6,000 years. Perhaps the Egyptians
  initially exploited the grape on a large scale. New varieties were developed by the Greeks
  and, later, by the Romans, who first practiced grafting and who introduced the vines into
  the cooler regions of Europe, including what is now France."<br>

<b>Old World grapes</b><br>
"Grape, fruit of the grape vine, useful as a fresh fruit, a dried fruit (raisin) and as the source of must and wine. In all these roles, but especially the last, the
grape was a major component of the diet of the ancient Meditrranean. The grape vine is native to southern Europe and the Near and
Middle East...The vine is thought to have been brought into cultivation in the Caucasus region...about 4000BC, although wine from
wild grapes was already being made by that time. Cultivated varieties spread to norhtern Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine, Egypt and north Africa;
also eastwards to Iran, Bactria and Sogdiana and (about 120 BC) onwards to China; also westwards through Anatolia and on to Greece
and the Balkans, Italy and the western Mediterranean. It was under the Roman Empire that the vine was introduced to the Moselle and Rhine
valles and to southern Britain. It is likely...that as knowledge of vine cultivation spread to new areas local wild grapes were taken
into cultivation and crossed with already cultivated varieties...By classical times vine cultivation had reached a high 
level of skill...Smoked raisins were a Roman fovourite."<br>

"The European grape is found wild on theost of the Caspian, in Armenia and in Karamania. From Asia it passed into Greece and thence
Sicily. The Phocians carried to the south of France; the Romas planted it on the banks of the Rhine. This grape is the most ancient culture...
Its introduction into all parts of the world has but multiplied its peculiariaties. Virgil says 'we neither can recount how numerous
the species, nor what are their names, nor imprts it to comprise their number...'...In the time of Chapta, about 1825, there were 1400
varieites enumerated in the luxembourg catalog obtained from France alone; the Geneva catalog numbered 600; Presl describes 44
varieties as cultivated in Sicily; Redding notices 12 kinds near Shriaz, Persia; and Burnes 10 kinds at Cabul. The Pinceau variety of 
France was known as long ago as 1394. Some believe that thevine was introduced into England by the Romans, while, according to others, it was first 
brought by the Phoenicians, who also have the credit of having transplanted it from Palestine to the islands of the
Mediterranean. The earlist English chronicles make meniton of vineyards, and vine culture is said to have continued until the Rreformation;
but the English climate is not suitable and the grape is grown only under glass except in a few favored locations."<br>

<b>Grape symbolism & mythology--Old World</b>
"Since antiquity the grapevine has served as a symbol of the benevolent nature god. It was the gods' gift to human beings, full of the power to inspire
and to lift the spirit to a higher realm. In ancient belief, the nature god revealed himself in the grapevine. The plant assumed such
significance in life that people accepted it as a symbol of peace and abundance...the biblical 'Promised Land' was often called the
Land of Grapes...For many, grapes symbolized fertility...In Indian myth they...represent the goddess of the earth. The ancient
Egyptians also considered grapes a fertility sybmol and the grapevine a Tree of Life...Much of the symbolsm of grapes has to do with their
use in making wine. Because red wine resembles blood, grapes came to symbolize blood sacrifice...for Christians, the blood of 
grapes came to symbolize the blood of Christ. Grapes and wine permeate Christan symbolism, with biblical references to vinyards, 
grapes, raisins, wine and vinegar numbering in the hundreds...Christian and Jewish myths generally credit Noah with the cultivation of the
grapevine, and Egyptian myths gave Orisis this honor. In prersian myth, the grapevine sprang from the tail of the primordial bull slain by Mithras, and in 
Greek myth, it sprang form a stick buried by Orion's dog. But the most popular myth of cultivation features Dionysus, the jovial wine god, 
whom the people envisionsed crowned with grape leaves and carring a staff, or thrsos, wrapped in grapevines. According to legend, a
snake taught Dionysus how to cultivate grapes and to make wine."<br>

"Although the Old World was the first to exploit it, the grape vine is a particularly American plant. Only one species of
grape is to be found wild in Europe, while there are a few places in temperate North America...without a native grape
species...American grapes found their first culinary use in the Native Americans' pemmican...Viking explorers named their Newdoundland
landfall Vinland, for the vines there; early colonists from England remarked on the bounty of grapes in their new home--and
also their acrid flavor. These grapes, Vitus labrusca, have two outstanding characteristics: a thick skin...and a highly 
pungent aroma...Introducing the wine grape of Europe...to America was a matter of policy in the colonies...That attempts at
introduction were not successful is evidenced by Thomas Jefferson's correspondence with Europe, seeking more robust as well as finer 
varieties of grape. Lack of sucess is explained not only by the occasionally harsh winters of the Atlantic seaboard but also by the
numerous pathogens specific to the vine...of which most native American species had developed resistnace or immunity, but to which
the European grape had none at all...Until the 1850s, grapes of dessert quality remained a luxury for those few who maintained a
greenhouse to grwo varieties of European origin...The first generations of American hybrid grapes were the basis of a wine

civilization, by the cheapening and popularizing of the small frut is during the past thirty years, can hardly be estimated. Best of them all is the 
grape. It appeals to the aesthetic taste as well as to the palate; it is grateful to the eye as well as the stomach, and a four or five cents

New Jersey, Western New York, Ohio, Missiouri, Michigan and Wisconsin...The four best
known Eastern varieties are the Concord (black). Niagara (green), Delaware (reddish) and Catawba (reddish)...The popularity of the

William Thompson, Yuba City Californa, is generally credited for introducting the seedless grapes bearing his name. The
year is fuzzy, either 1876 or 1878 depending upon the source. Historic newspapers confirm seedless
grapes were of special economic interested to local growers after the Civil War. The competition was fierce.

Europe, especially in the East or Orient, where that grape is grown, it goes under the name of Passolina. That word has an Itlain

<a name="flameseedless">
<b>Flame Seedless grapes</b><br>
Most sources agree that Flame seedless is the mostimportant of red
  seedless grapes. The "invention" of Flame seedless is credited to John
  Weinberger, who began working on this variety in the mid-1950s. Flame
  seedless was introduced to the American public in 1973. Thompson
  seedless (introduced in the late 19th century) is a green grape.
  <p>
  "The Flame seedless grape, one of the central San Joaquin Valley's great summer treats, is
  now moving from local vineyards to dinner tables across the country, according to the
  weekly crop report from the Fresno County Department of Agriculture. This crisp, red
  grape, introduced in 1983, ranks right behind the Thompson seedless in the hearts of table
  grape lovers. The Flame was developed in Fresno County by the late John Weinberger, a
  U.S. Agriculture Department plant scientist who bred and released 37 varieties of
  peaches, plums, nectarines, apricots and grapes in his 41-year career."<br>
  ---"Bloom is still fine for Flame seedless grape," Guy Keeler, <i>The Fresno Bee</i>, July 10, 2002 (p. E3)
  <p>
  "There's a new kid on the block, and grape specialists say it bears watching. It goes by the
  name of Red Flame Seedless. "I think it is an important new development," says Don
  Luvisi, farm adviser at the University of California Cooperative Extension in Bakersfield.
  "I think the biggest characteristic is its crispness and it has kind of a tartness to it, a
  sweetness and tartness at the same time. Just about anybody I've given this grape to over
  the last seven or eight years has wanted to know where can they get more of it."  The Red
  Flame is one of the first marketable red varieties without seeds, Luvisi says. "But I think
  more in the consumer's favor is that this is a delightful variety to eat." The Red Flame is
  not exactly newborn. It was developed in Fresno about 20 years ago by Dr. John
  Weinberger, a specialist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture who has since retired.
  "The original crop was grown in 1962 and fruited in 1964. It was released in 1973,"
  Luvisi says. "It takes at least 10 years to develop any new variety, and the marketing takes
  a little bit longer than that. How do you evaluate any variety when you're marketing 34
  million packages of fruit and you have 500 or 1,000 packages?" He says the Red Flame is
  now grown throughout the San Joaquin Valley of California, as well as in Mexico and in
  limited quantities in Arizona. In California, officials estimate 360 acres were devloted to
  Red Flame grapes in 1978-79, 1,300 in 1979-80 and 3,000 in 1980-81. But, Luvisi says,
  "Actually I think it's closer to 4,000 or 5,000 or maybe a little better." The Red Flame,
  which as an early-season crop ripens in mid-July, has been wending its way to market in
  increasing quantities _ about 230,000 boxes in 1980 and 1 million boxes this year.
  Consumers may not always be able to distinguish Red Flame grapes by sight from other
  red table grapes, but Luvisi says that "some growers put little tags on them that say they're
  Red Seedless or Seedless." He says flavor and a lack of seeds are the variety's main
  attractions for consumers, while vigorous growth habits, good resistance to disease and
  adaptibility to a range of climates make it popular with growers. Despite those attributes,
  Luvisi says, the Red Flame will not steal the leadership of the grape world's star grape,
  the Thompson seedless - which farmers say is white and most consumers consider green.
  But there is plenty of room for another player, and grape specialists will be watching to
  see out the Red Flame performs, Luvisi says. "Will the consumer accept it? Will their
  interest continue?" he asks. "If so, this should become one of the major table grape
  varieties." <br>

lore, make their delicious Sirop de Groseilles as the ancients made their delcious verjuice and then sweeten and color it before bottling. Verjuice proper, which is
used in England and on the Continent as as substitute for lemon-juice, is made by expressing the juice from unripe grapes, gooseberries and sour crabapples. The 
juice, filtered through a cloth until clear, and exposed uncorked to the sun for a week, as the fermentation progresses, the verjuice overflows the bottles, and 
more is added daily; at the end of a week an ounce of salt is put into each pint of verjuice, and the bottles are tightly corked and sealed. Before the final 
bottling, the bottles should be held over the smoke of burning sulpher, the verjuice is poured into them before the smoke escapes, and the corking and sealing is
done at once...Our (USA) nearest approach to verjuice is cider vinegar..."<br>

"Let's not stereotype power ingredients....Need proof? Go get yourself a bottle of verjuice. The French spelling, verjus, tells you what it is: 'vert
jus" or 'green juice.' But in this 'green' as in unripe, not as in color. In medieval times, when sour was more widely appreciated than it is now, the term
could refer to the juice of a variety of unripe fruits, from grapes to crab apples to plums. Verjuice was used to deepen flavors and add a delicate
tartness to all kinds of sauces, condiments, stews and meats; it was a staple of the French pantry. But then came an interloper: the lemon, introduced to 
Europe by returning Crusaders, this medieval convenience food had only to be cut open to yield a tart juice. No pressing or bottling required. Over the
years the popularity of verjuice began to fade, until by the 19th century it had been relegated to the back of the top of the pantry shelf. Fortunately in the last
decade or so it has begun to seep back into the consciousness of Western cooks. In its odern iteration, verjuice refers only to the bottled juice of unripe grapes,
usually picked halfway during the thinning process about halfway toward maturity. Green grapes are most often used, but sometimes red are added, creating a slightly
heartier product. Like lemon juice, verjuice adds a bright tartness to a wide range of dishes. But it has an advantage over its far more popular competitor. It's a
more gentle, subtle tartness, with a faint but definite undercurrent of vegetal sweetness. Because of this, it is more adept at complementing rather than masking
other flavors in dishes where it's used...Unfortunately, verjuice can be sometimes hard to find. It's available by mail order...Most of them hover around the $20
mark for a 750-milliliter bottle."<br>

<font color="#003366" size="+2"><b>Bananas & plantains</b></font><br>
Prehistoric hunter-gatherers used banana plants for food, fiber, and building materials. The general place of origin is
Southeast Asia; the exact epicenter is still debated. Global diffusion and varieties reflect local history and exploration. 
Botanists tell us banans are herbs. They are consumed as fruit, vegetable, and flour.

<a href="fruit.html#plantain2">wild leafy green</a>.
<P>
<b>What is a banana?</b><br>
Banana...The various forms of the banana (Musa paradisiaca) are probably native to South and Southeast Asia and doubtless helped feed hunter-gatherers for hundreds of thousands 
of years. The banana is among the oldest plants that humans have used, was one of the first to be cultivated, and today constitutes one of the most important food crops in the world. 
The identity of the exact homeland of the banana has been blurred by the plant's ability to spread rapidly throughout the tropics....when bananas reached the tropical New World 
(apparently with Spanish explorers), they propagated with such rapidity that some of the earliest chroniclers through that the fruit was an American native. And bananas apparently 
reached tropical Africa and Polynesia much earlier (c. A.D. 500 and 1000, respectively) than they did in the New World. The banana 'tree' is really a giant herb that can grow to 20 or more
 feet in height in only a year."<br> 
---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kenneth F. Kiple & Kriemhild Conee Ornelas [Cambridge University Press:Cambridge] 2000, Volume Two (p. 1726) 
<p>
<b>Why were bananas "domesticated?"</b><br>
"The evolution and spread of the banana has recently been discussed in detail by N.W. Simmonds, but although much is now known of the taxonomy, genetics and more recent
origins of this fruit, its early domestication is still rather questionable. The wild banana is somewhat unattractive, seedy, and inedible, and has been changed by man from this jungle weed tino
a large seedless fruit. The wild plants are distributed in tropical Asia and Australiasia ...and certainly this area is the cradle of banana domestication. However, the story is not simply one of deliberage 
selection for larger and larger fruit, and Simmonds has pointed out that in fact the plant may well at first have been cultivated for other reasons. In particular, the sheaths yield 
valuable fibres, the leaves are useful wrapping materials, and from the point of view of food, the soft inner sheaths, the male buds and flowers, and the immature fruits can  all be eaten as
vegetables...Thus, fruit improvements probably followed long after the plant was cultivated for these other resasons. Literary and archeological evidence for the banana is scattered and as
yet very sparse. In India, it is not noted before 600 BC, although linguistic studies trace its use back possibley to pre 3000BC. The early African cultivars...probably reached Madagascar
from Malaya late in the first half of the first millennium AD, and then  spread westwards through Africa. Possibly many of the Pacific islands were cultivating the banana by about 
AD 1000. Claims of a considerable antiquity for the plant, in two widely separated regions of the world, are still open to debate. In one or two Assyrian carvings, representing royal
banquets, banana-like fruits are depiced. As texts make no mention of the fruit, we have only the art evidence at present, but it would not be unreasonable to postulate a very early
introduction from India, perhaps by traders wishing to provided special variety at the royal table. The other instance concerns pre-Columbian America, wehre it is claime that
banana reamains were found in early Peruvian tombs. This claim would seem to deserve careful investigation, and if substantiated, would give added weight to early trans-Pacific
human movements."<br>

<b>Why do we call them "bananas?"</b><br>
"Banana appears to be a tropical African word, but its lexical origins represent only a single stage in the fruit's worldwide wanderings before it reached British shores. It probably
grew first in Southeast Asia, and did not make a big impact elsewhere until in the early Islamic period it was brought from India to the Middle East, and thence to Africa. The odd
banana had turned up in Europe before that...but only as an exotic rarity: in ancient Rome...it had to make do with borrowing the name of the fig (a notion which lived on in the early
French term for 'banana', <i>fitue du paradis</i>). Spanish and Portuguese colonists took the banana with them across the Atlantic form Africa to the Americas, and along with it they 
brought its African name, banana, apparently a word from one of the languages of the Congo area (it has been speculated that it derives ultimately form Arabic <i>banana</i>, 
'finger toe', an origin which would be echoed int the English term <i>hand</i> for a bunch of bananas..."<br>

<b>When did Americans "discover" bananas?</b><br>
Bananas were introduced and actively promoted after the U.S. Civil War. Advances in transportation parlayed this exotic
fruit to the forefront of national cuine. Bananas were introduced as fruits, to be consumed raw (fruit salads), 
and as a dessert flavoring (banana cream, banana custard, banana ice cream, banana cake).  From the 1880s forwards, cookbooks offered banana recipes. 
In the mid-20th century, corporate cooking brochures published by Dole and Chiquita promoted bananas for  
all meals and courses: grilled bananas, ham banana rolls, baked bananas (in the peel), banana scallops & broiled bananas.

appear in retail networks, in greengrocer shops, and on pushcarts. They were linked to romantic adventure and associated with palm trees, warm
weather, and perpetual vacation. many nineteeth-century writers confused the banana and the plantian. One descrpbed the banana as 
'similar in composition to the potato...'In 1872 housewives were told that 'bananas have a taste something like muskmelons. They are 
not improved by cooking, yet may be preserved to taste as well when raw...'...Bananas were also described as being 'as large as a cucumber
and resembling it in color and shape.'...In the nineteenth cnetury the people of the United States loved fruit...They had also enthusiastically
adopted such exotic imported delicacies as the pineapple and the coconut...The Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 
1876 included a forty-acre display of tropical plants in the Horticultural Hall with...a panana plant...The banana plant was so
popular that a guard had to be posted near it so that visitors would not pull it apart for souvenirs...Bananas were 
available at a specialty greengrocer in Philadelphia in 1876, wrapped in tinfoil at 10 cents apiece--an hour's wage for 
many people...It was not until the mid-1880s that people in the Midwest became somewhat familiar with the banana as a fruit and 
could find them in grocery stores. Even then bananas were expensive and remained a luxury item for some time."<br>

The usual mode of expressing the essential oil is to take the split lemon, or the fresh peel, and squeeze it against a sponge. There may be other processes of refining and distilling afterward, but the chief business is the hand work thus described. The true Bergamot lemon is of the color as deep as that of the orange, although I have seen some that were paler."<br>

"Among fruit fanciers several incline to derive name of this favorite species of pear from the Italian town of Bergamo, while a larger number prefer Pergamos, laying stress on the fact that this species was first introduced into Europe by the Crusaders, which is now doubt the reason why in some parts of Southern Europe they are still known by the name of Syrian pears. But the geographer Ritter more than 30 years ago pointed out what seems to be a more probably derivation. A fine and late ripening pear is much cultivated in the neighborhood of Angora, and on account of its lateness in maturing used formerly to be in great favor at Constantinople.

"Walk the fields now and you walk with the mints, particularly with the bergamots, those shaggy-headed friends of the bees. There is wild bergamot, there is Oswego tea, and there is bee balm, all of them bergamots and through the names are often ussed interchangeably, they actually denote slight variations within the family. The borderline between tame, or garden, bergamot and the wild bergamots is rather thinly drawn. Many of the tame ones escape and take to the fields; and the wild ones, given a chance, will readily domesticate. Oswego tea is botannically Monarda didyama, a showy plant with scarlet red flowers. Old herbalists brewed a concoction from its leaves and florets, and so did backwoods wives when tea was scarce. It tastes much like any mint tea, not too savory to the average palate. Wild bergamot, which is sometimes called bee balm--Oswego tea is also called bee balm--has a somewhat smaller flower and its color is primarily magenta. A third variety, with no widely known common name, is plentiful in the rolling hill country the foothills of the Catskills and the Berkshires. Its color is a delicate crimson pink, quite different from the usual bergamot color. It stands just now in fine flower and in large beds in those foothills, and to walk through it is like walking through a wave of wild, mintyh fragrance.

Blueberries are New World foods. European settlers embraced them because they resembled familiar berries, most notably
blackberries, whortleberries, and huckleberries. Thrifty colonial cooks found blueberries adapted well to traditional recipes.
Blueberries were consumed as fresh fruit, incorporated into baked goods (think: pies, muffins), preserved as jams & jellies
 and dried, like grapes, for future use.
<p>
"Blueberries come from any number of shrubs of the genus Vaccinium that grow wild
over much of the globe and can be found in the Western Hemisphere from Alaska to the
jungles of South America. Those indigenous to North America are either highbush...or
lowbush...The former type has been commercially cultivated in the United States
throughout most of the twentieth century and is considerably larger than its wild
counterparts. Blueberries, which look almost the same as huckleberries, keep longer in
storage than other berries--in both fresh and frozen forms. Blueberries were an important
food for Native Americans, who used them for winter use. The Indians of Alaska have
traditionally preserved them in seal oil for consumption in the winter."

Asimina Triloba are fruits native to temperate eastern and central North America. While they grow and fruit prolifically given optimal conditions, thin skin and short ripening period defies cultivation, transportation and commercialization. Researching the history of pawpaws presents a linguistic tangle of alternative names. Some of these names are also names of totally different plants (papayas, custard apples); others are local appellations (Michigan banana, false banana, Indian banana). Spelling variations (papaw, paw-paw) and alternative definitions (in some Appalachian USA regions papaw can also mean grandfather) render this fruit one of the most interesting to subjects for study. 
<p>
<b>General overview</b><br> 
"The North American pawpaw...has a well-established place in folklore and rural culture. 'Way Down Yonder in the Pawpaw Patch' is an America folk song that was quite popular once, and fall hunting for pawpaws in the woods is still a cherished tradition for may rural families. Interest has grown in the pawpaw as a gourmet food. Pawpaws grow wild in the understories of hardwood forests in the eastern United States, ranging from northern Florida to southern Ontario in Canada and as far west as eastern Nebraska. The fruit of the pawpaw can weigh from three or four ounces to a pound and may be born singly or in clusters. pawpaws are highly nutritious, with a strong aroma and a unique flavor that resembles a combination of banana, mango, and pineapple. Pawpaws are ripe with soft and are usually harvested from September to October across their native range. When ripe, skin color ranges from green to yellow and flesh color ranges from creamy white to shades of orange. The fruit should be harvested prior to the first frost. Pulp from the fruit can be eaten fresh or cooked. The flavor of the fruit can intensify when it is overripe, as with bananas, resulting in pulp that is excellent for use in cooking. The seed and skin are 
generally not eaten. Local delicacies made from fruit pulp include ice cream, compote, jam, pie, custard, and wine." <br>

"Generally mentioned as one of the many foods that sustained native Americans, the papaw is central to a muddle of nomenclature because its names, 'papaw' and pawpaw,' probably came from 'papaya,' a fruit to which it is not related.

People always laugh when the pawpaw is mentioned, though why, Heaven knows. For it has a rich and luscious flavor--not unlike the custard apple of the Hesperides. it digests easily in the human stomach, and cheers but does not ingratiate. yet humanity has left it alone. It crowns no festal board. It forms the centre of no famous dish. The pawpaw is not pickled, preserved, dried or stored away against any day of want. No pawpaw pie or pawpaw pudding is known to man; the pawpaw stewed or baked or fried never has appeared upon any housewife's table, however humble it may be. In all the famine that followed the droughts of the early days of the pioneers when want was forever peering around the corner of tomorrow, no one even turned to the pawpaw for preservation...Probably the pawpaw's limitation comes from the fact that it is hard to eat with any dignity. Now woman would dare eat a pawpaw in the presence of her lover; the sight is disgusting to the point of utter disillusion. Byron is said to have hated to see a woman spit. If he could have seen a woman eat a pawpaw, he would have been a different man. 'Don Juan' might never have been written. No on can eat a pawpaw who is not willing to revert to barbarism, to jump back to the forest. A pawpaw probably was intended for a feast in the tree crotch, where spitting seeds is easy and natural...So, we have the pawpaw neglected.

"The pawpaw harvest is in. The fruit has gone to market--what little market there is. And the Johnny Appleseed of pawpaws is waxing poetic. ..The taste is a 'symphony of flavors in your mouth. It's like the finest custard you ever ate,' He is R. Neal Peterson, a 45-year-old agricultural economist who has spent much of his free time since 1979 studying the fruit. The Washington D.C. resident grew up eating wild pawpaws in West Virginia and developed a scientific interest in the tree when he was in college studying plant genetics. He took pity on the poor pawpaw. Around the turn of the century, the fruit, native to the Central and Southern U.S., had actually been quite popular. A children's song was written about it...Towns and streams ain Michigan, Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky were named after it. And during the Depression, some people who couldn't afford to buy food lived on the fruit of the pawpaw. But the pawpaw went into decline as the banana became very popular in the U.S. during World War II, and as the population became more urban and thus less likely to encounter wild pawpaw trees. The pawpaw, a fruit of the custard apple family that resembles a green potato or a mango with bright yellow flesh, also has some built-in commercial disadvantages: It is thin-skinned and doesn't travel well. 'I though this was one of the most overlooked trees in the country,' Mr. Peterson says. 'It hasn't been domesticated. It hasn't received thousands of years of breeding like apples and apricots...Through proper selection and breeding, Mr. Peterson hopes one day to grow a pawpaw that has fewer of those large reddish-brown seeds...which are annoyingly numerous and can account for about 20% of a fruit's weight. 
Right now, harvested pawpaws, picked soft or taken when they fall from the tree, keep only for about two days...About five years ago, Mr. Peterson set up the PawPaw Foundation to further the scientific study of his favorite fruit...Guy Reinhold, executive chef for the Stouffer Harbor Place Hotel in Baltimore, created a pawpaw salsa and pawpaw chutney to go with some of his seafood and chicken dishes.

"The pear originated in the general region of the Caucausus, as did its
     cousin the apple; and both fruits were spread by the Aryan tribes from that
     area as they migrated into Europe and N. India. Both belong to the rose
     family, Rosaceae. The orginal wild pear has been developed into what are
     now nearly 1,000 varieties, after a certain amoung of interbreeding with
     other native wild pears of Europe and Asia...In ancient times the pear was
     generally considered a better fruit than the apple. Thus in China only one
     variety of apple was known until the end of the Sung dynasty (AD 1279),
     but there were many varieties of pear. In classical Greece and Rome a
     similar preference was evident. Around 300BC the Greek writer
     Theophrastus discussed the growing of pears, including advanced
     techniques such as grafting and cross-pollination. Two centuries later, in
     Rome, Pliny the Elder described 41 varieties, whereas his parallel list of
     apples was much shorter. During the Middle Ages the pear was especially
     popular in France and Italy, and most pears grown in Britain were from
     French stock. However, the famous warden pear was of British origin; it
     was raised by Cistercian monks at an abbey in Bedfordshire. So important
     did it become as a cooking pear that it was regarded as a fruit in its own
     right; one finds reference to 'wardens and pears'. Although pears for
     dessert were prized, it is noticeable that the balance between them and
     cooking pears was much more even in the past than it became in the 19th
     anc 20th centuries...In the 17th century pear-growing in France was at its
     height and many new varieties were developed. Louis XIV was particularly
     interested in fruit and vegetables and the pear was one of his favourite
     fruits...

<b>What was "Pearmania?"</b><br>
Throughout history, <a href="fruit.html#pears">pears</a> have been associated with the wealthier classes. This non-pedestrian fruit was cultivated in
great estates and relished by nobles throughout Europe. This passion was introduced to North America (there are no
native American pears) by early European colonists. New England's "Pear mania" (circa 1820-1870) was a pasttime of
the upper class. These prized pears were not for sale; they were offered to honored guests. It is interesting to note that
New England cookbooks published in this period contain very few pear recipes. Stewed pears and pear tarts are the
norm. This suggests (perhaps) pears were not widely consumed by the general public. 
 <p>
"From approximately 1820 to 1870 a mania for pears raged in New England, particularly in eastern Massachusetts.
Gentlemen farmers vied to produce the most luscious specimens of fine European pears and in the selection of seedling
varieties. They savored the fruits in the library as an occasion for male bonding and connoisseurship, much as they
played golf and smoked cigars together in later periods. Once California started shipping tons of fruit by rail car to the
east, interest in the pear as a status symbol diminished."<br>

Persimmons (Diospyros) are indigenous to both old world and new. They are commonly found in
North America, China, India and Japan. Old world persimmons were known to ancient cooks and
were assigned spiritual significance. New world persimmons were enjoyed by Native Americans
in a variety of ways, including a beer-type product. This fruit was shared with 16th European
explorers, who eventually incorporated it into many traditional European recipes. Commodore
M.C. Perry is credited for introducing oriental varieties to North America in the mid-19th century
(there are conflicting stories regarding the exact date). These trees flourished in Florida and
California. Most persimmons consumed in America today are of the oriental variety.

"Persimmon. 
Although there are persimmon trees that are native to North America, the orange-red persimmon
(Diospyros khaki) that North Americans usually consume originated in Asia. This persimmon is
native to China but is known as the Japanese persimmon because it has been cultivated mostly in
Japan. Today, however, the fruit is also cultivated in the south of France and some of the
Mediterranean countries, where it was introduced in the early nineteenth century, and in the

"Persimmons are species of Diospyros, a genus of Ebanacae, a family renowned for its tropical
Asian and African members that since antiquity have provided ebony-wood to the high
civilizations of the Old World. Several species of Diospyros also provide edible fruits, with three
of them well-known for their contribution to human diet. The three are indigenous mainly to the
temperate and sub-tropical regions of Asia or North America. The "common persimmon," D.
Virginiana, is native to the eastern woodlands of the United States...The "date-plum" of the
Mediterranean, D. Lotus, is native to an area stretching from southeastern Europe to northwest
India, China and Japan, and is cultivated in certain places, among them southern Europe,
northwest India, and China....Both of the above species not only provide fruit but may be used as
rootstock for the third, and most important commercial species, D. Khaki...the "Japanese
persimmon," long important in Japan, China, and Korea, and introduced to the United States in
the nineteenth century."<br>

"Persimmon: a fruit concerning which there is much confusion of information--and misinformation--even in works otherwise
generally reliable. This is probably due to the fact that there are two distinct fruit bearing the title--the North
America and the Japanese--belonging to the same class and both now grown in this country, but with many points of
difference in size and character…The native American Persimmon is about the size of a small plum and grows on a big
tree which often reaches a height of sixty feet. The Japanese Persimmon ranges from the size of a peach, to that of a
small melon, and is bourne by a tree that is comparatively small. The American is at its best after it has been touched by
frost. It becomes then a veritable sugarplum--its sweetness has earned for it the nickname of the American 'Date Plum', and
the oddly wrinkled lumps of richly concentrated sugar-flesh hanging among the vari-colored leaves of autumn are as eagerly
sought by 'Possums' an other wild creatures as by human beings. The Japanese Persimmon, or 'Ka-Ki', or 'Chinese Fig', varies
widely in quality and shape--from the inclined to be tasteless and dry, to a delicious and juicy type: from perfectly
round, to extremely elongated in shape. It is as rich in food values as the banana. It will probably receive much more
attention in the future, as it is readily suseptible to cultivation, produces with prodigal abundance and stands shipment well.
...Unlike the American variety, the Japanese does not need the frost touch, but neither is it damaged as are most either fruits.
It is just right for eating when the skin first begins to wrinkle In addition to their excellence for eating raw, both fruits 
can be easily and successfully dried for future use. The American and the 'chocolate' or dark-meated varieties of the Japanese also
lend themselves readily to a great variety of preserves, and in several parts of the South the ground roasted seeds are as a 
substitute for coffee."<br.

<b>Persimmon history/New World</b><br> 
"The British first encountered the persimmon in Virginia in the early seventeenth century, a fact
revealed by the name they gave to it: persimmon is a somewhat garbled version of a word in one
of the Algonquin languages of North America, perhaps Cree pasiminan or Lenape pasimenan
(the earliest recorded attempt at it is English is in Captain John Smith's Map of Virginia (1612):
 the fruit like melders; they call Putchamins, they cast upon hurdles on a mat, and preserve them
as Prunes'). Most persimmons available in Europe, however, are of the related Japanese
variety...Somewhat resembling large orange tomatoes, they have a bitter-sweet slightly
mucilaginous flesh which only develops to full sweetness and fragrance when the fruit is very
ripe."<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 251-2)

"The accepted story about the persimmon is that when Europeans first encountered it in America they 
found it too acid to eat and abandoned it until the Indians explained to them that it becomes
sweet and palatable after the first frost. Writers ever since...have been stating confidently, that
it is frost which tames the persimmon. It isn't The Indians must have known better, but their calendar was
nature, and when they said that persimmons were best after the first frost, they were only dating this phenomenon in
terms which for them were equivalent to Euell Gibbons's statement that persimmons are best in 
October They did not mean that frost causes the persimmon to lose its astrigency and reveal its basic
sweetness. It is probably the latest ripener of all tree fruits..The first Europeans to encounter the persimmon, Diospyros 
virginiana, were either the Spanish conquistadors, who fed largely on the during their grueling marh...from Florida to New 
Mexico, or Herandez de Soto, who reported circa 1540 that he had found the Indians along the Mississippi eating bread
made of 'prunes' (they dried the persimmons before converting them into a sort of dough)..."<br>

"Persimmon or American persimmon...(Diospyros virginiana)The name persimmon comes from 
putchamin', a phonetic rendering of the name used by the American Indians of the Algonquin
tribe. They ate them when they were ripe and had fallen from the tree and dried them to be eaten
in the winter. The first European to write about the fruit was probably the Spanish explorer Don
Fernando de Soto, who learned about it from the Indians of Florida in 1539. Captain John Smith,
in the 17th century, likened it to the medlar...Ripe persimmons were eaten by the settlers, or used
in puddings, breads, preserves, etc. But the production of persimmon (or  ‘simmon') beer and
wine and other alcoholic drinks was an equally important use...During the 19th century and the
early years of the 20th there was considerable interest in the development of improved
persimmons, based for example on the Early Golden cultivar which originated in Illinois; but this
was largely stifled by the introduction of the khaki to California...There is one other persimmon
native to America, D. Texense, known as the chapote, or black or Mexican persimmon. Its range
includes Central and Western Texas and parts of Mexico."<br>

"Persimmon...Also called "date plum." A tree chiefly of the tropics bearing a late-ripening
orange-red fruit. The word is from the Algonquin, akin to the Cree word for dried fruit,
pasiminan, first appearing in print as "putchamin" in 1612, then in its present form in 1709...The
earliest explorers and colonists of the New World were fascinated by the persimmon. Hernando
de Soto, in about 1540, compared it with the Spanish red plum and preferred the persimmon.
John Smith in Virginia at the beginning of the seventeenth century called it "one of the most
palatable fruits of this land," something like an apricot. Not every settler agreed...The Native
Americans made it into beer, which the colonists soon adapted, and bread, which in Missouri was
called "stanica."...The Native "American persimmon" was eventually pushed aside as a
commercial crop in favor of the "Japanese persimmon", which may have been introduced to the
United States in 1855 by Commodore Matthew C. Perry. In the South persimmon seeds are
ground to be used as a coffee substitute, and throughout the Southeast and Midwest persimmon
pudding is a Thanksgiving tradition. "Locust beer" is made persimmons and locusts."<br>

edge, yellow with a black strip round the margin and with black spots, dark brown, reddish-brown, russet-brown, black, cultured or as if 
engraved with ornamental characters, and pink or red. The watermelon is mentioned by the early botanists and described as of large
size, but it must be considered that this fruit even now is not a successfully grwon in Europe as in more southern countries. That 
none or few types have originated under modern culture is indicated by an examination into the early records...Cardanus, 1556,
writes that the size is sometimes so great that a man can scarcely embrace the fruit with his expanded arms. Marcgravius, 1648,
