<a name="aboutcake">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>About cake</b></font><br>
The history of cake dates back to ancient times. The first cakes were very different
from what we eat today. They were more bread-like and sweetened with honey. Nuts and dried
fruits were often added. According to the food historians, the ancient Egyptians were the first
culture to show evidence of advanced baking skills. The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> traces
the English word cake back to the 13th century. It is a derivation of  'kaka', an Old Norse word.
Medieval European bakers often made fruitcakes and gingerbread. These foods could last for
many months.
<p>
     According to the food historians, the precursors of modern cakes (round ones with icing) were
first baked in Europe sometime in the mid-17th century. This is due to primarily to advances in
technology (more reliable ovens, manufacture/availability of food molds) and ingredient
availability (refined sugar). At that time cake hoops--round molds for shaping cakes that were
placed on flat baking trays--were popular. They could be made of metal, wood or paper. Some
were adjustable. Cake pans were sometimes used. The <a href="foodcakes.html#icing">first icing</a> were
usually a boiled
composition of the finest available sugar, egg whites and [sometimes] flavorings. This icing was
poured on the cake. The cake was then returned to the oven for a while. When removed the
icing cooled quickly to form a hard, glossy [ice-like] covering. Many cakes made at this time still
contained dried fruits (raisins, currants, citrons).
<p>
     It was not until the middle of the 19th century that cake as we know it today (made with extra
refined white flour and baking powder instead of yeast) arrived on the scene. A brief  <a
href="foodfaq.html#bakingpowder"> history of
baking powder</a>.
<i>The Cassell's New Universal Cookery Book</i> [London, 1894] contains a recipe for layer
cake,
American (p. 1031). Butter-cream frostings (using butter, cream, confectioners [powdered] sugar
and flavorings) began replacing traditional boiled icings in first few decades 20th century. 
     In France, Antonin Careme [1784-1833] is considered THE premier historic chef of  the
modern pastry/cake world. You will find references to him in French culinary history books.

<a name="aboutgateau">
<b> What is the difference between cake, gateau and torte?</b><br>
Gateaux is a French word for cake. It generally denotes items made with delicate ingredients
which are best consumed soon after the confection is made (gateaux des roi). Cakes can last much
longer, some even improving with age (fruit cake). <a href="foodcakes.html#tortes">Torte</a> is the German
word for cake, with similar properties. When tortes are multilayerd and fancifully decorated they
are closer to gateaux EXCEPT for the fact they can last quite nicely for several days. 
<p>
<b>Cake & gateau: definitions & examples</b>
<p>
"Cakes and gateaux. Although both terms can be used for savoury preparations (meat cakes or
vegetable gateaux) their main use is for sweet baked goods. Cakes can be large or small, plain of
fancy, light or rich. Gateau is generally used for fancy, but light or rich, often with fresh
decoration, such as fresh fruit or whipped cream. Whereas a cake may remain fresh for several
days after baking or even improve with keeping, a gateau usually includes fresh decoration or
ingredients that do not keep well, such as fresh fruit or whipped cream. In France, the word
'gateau' designates various patisserie items based on puff pastry, shortcrust pastry (basic pie
dough), sweet pastry, pate saglee, choux pastry, Genoese and whisked sponges and
meringue...The word 'gateau' is derived from the Old French wastel, meaning 'food'. The first
gateau were simply flat round cakes made with flour and water, but over the centuries these were
enriched with honey, eggs, spices, butter, cream and milk. From the very earliest items, a large
number of French provinces have produced cakes for which they are noted. Thus Artois had
gateau razis, and Bournonnais the ancient tartes de fromage broye, de creme et de moyeau
d'oeulz. Hearth cakes are still made in Normandy, Picardy, Poitou and in some provinces in the
south of France. They are variously called fouaces, fouaches, fouees or fouyasses, according to
the district...Among the many pastries which were in high favor from the 12th to the 15th
centuries in Paris and other cities were: echaudes, of which two variants, the falgeols and the
gobets, were especially prized by the people of Paris; and darioles, small tartlets covered with
narrow strips of pastry...Casse-museau is a hard dry pastry still made today'...petits choux and
gateaux feuilletes are mentioned in a charter by Robert, Bishop of Amiens in 1311." <br>
---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, completely revised and updated [Clarkson Potter:New York]
2001 (p. 198-199) 
<p>
"Cake. The original dividing line between cake and bread was fairly thin: Roman times eggs and butter were often added to basic
bread dough to give a consistency we would recognize as cakelike, and this was frequently sweetened with honey. Terminologically, too, 
the earliest English cakes were virtually bread, their main distinguishing characteristics being their shape--round and
flat--and the fact that they were hard on both sides from being turned over during baking...in England the shape and contents of
cakes were graudally converging toward our present understanding of the term. In medieval and Elizabethan times they were usually 
quite small...Cake is a Viking contribution to the English language; it was borrowed from Old Norse kaka, which is related to a range
of Germanic words, including modern English cook."
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 52)

<p>
"Gateau. English borrowed gateau from French in the mid-nineteenth century, and at first used it
fairly indiscriminately for any sort of cake, pudding, or cake-like pie...Since the Second World
War, however, usage of the term has honed in on an  elaborate 'cream cake': the cake element,
generally a fairly unremarkable sponge, is in most cases simply an excuse for lavish layers of
cream, and baroque cream and fruit ornamentation...The word gateau is the modern French
descendant of Old French guastel,  'fine bread'; which is probably of Germanic origin. In its
northeastern Old French dialect from wasel it as borrowed into English in the thirteenth century,
where it survived until the seventeenth century."
---An A to Z of Food and Drink, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 138)
<p>
"The word  'gateau' crossed the Channel to England in the early 19th century...In Victorian
England cookery writers used  'gateau' initially to denote puddings such as rice baked in a mould,
and moulded baked dishes of fish or meat; during the second part of the century it was also
applied to highly decorated layer cakes. Judging by the amount of space given to directions for
making these in bakers' manuals of the time, they were tremendously popular...Most were
probably rather sickly, made from cheap sponge filled with  'buttercream'...and coated with
fondant icing. Elaborate piped decoration was added. Many fanciful shapes were made...The
primary meaning of the word  'gateau' is now a rich and elaborate cake filled with whipped cream
and fruit, nuts, or chocolate. French gateau are richer than the products of British bakers. They
involve thin layers of sponge, usually genoise, or meringue; some are based on choux pastry. Fruit
or flavoured creams are used as fillings. The later are rarely dairy cream; instead creme patissiere
(confectioner's custard--milk, sugar, egg yolks, and a little flour) or creme au buerre (a rich
concoction of egg yolks creamed with sugar syrup and softened butter) are used. Gateau has
wider applications in French, just as  'cake' does in English...it can mean a savoury cake, a sweet
or savoury tart, or a thin pancake."
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
332)

<a name="roundcakes">
<b>Why are cakes round?</b><br>
Excellent question! Food historians offer several theories. Each depends upon period, culture and
cuisine.
Generally, the round cakes we know today descended from ancient bread. Ancient breads and
cakes were
made by hand. They were typically fashioned into round balls and baked on hearthstones, griddles, or in
low, shallow
pans. These products naturally relaxed into rounded shapes. By the 17th century, cake hoops
(fashioned
from metal or wood) were placed on flat pans to effect the shape. As time progressed, baking
pans in
various shapes and sizes, became readily available to the general public. Moulded cakes (and
fancy ices)
reached their zenith in Victorian times. 
<p>
"For the cakes of the seventeenth century onwards tin or iron hoops were increasingly used and
are mentioned with great frequency in the cookery books. These hoops were similar to our
modern flan rings but much deeper...The hoop was placed on an iron or tin sheet, and a layer or
two of paper, floured, was put at the bottom. The sides of the hoop were buttered, These or
similar directions offer over and over again in E. Smith's <i>The Compleat Housewife</i>, first
published in 1727, which gives recipes for forty cakes, the large ones nearly all being
yeast-leavened. In her preface this author says that her book was the fruit of upwards of thirty
years'
experience, so her recipes and methods must often date well back into the previous century, for
quite often the reader is directed to bake the cake in a 'paper hoop'--and paper was a feature of
the kitchens of those days. Wooden hoops were also fairly common. Some cooks, the
seventeenth-century Sir Kenelm Digby among others, evidently preferred them to tin, perhaps
because they didn't rust, and so were easier to store. Probably they would have been rather like
the frames of our present-day drum sieves. Writing a century after Digby, Elizabeth Raffald calls
them  'garths' and advises her readers that for large cakes they are better than  'pot or tin', in
which the cakes, so Mrs. Raffald found, were liable to burn more easily. Alternatively, spice cakes
were baked like bread, without moulds."<br>
---<i>English Bread and Yeast Cookery</i>, Elizabeth David, American edition with notes from Karen Hess [Penguin:Middlesex] 1979 (p. 212)
<p>
<a name="cakesymbol">
<b>What do cakes mean?</b><br>
Ancient breads and cakes were sometimes used in religious ceremonies. These were purposely
fashioned
into specific shapes, according to the observance. <a href="foodcakes.html#roundakes">Round & circle</a> shapes generally symbolize the cyclical
nature of life. Most specifically, the sun and moon. Cakes baked in molds could be shaped and decorated to look like 
animals (Easter lambs), castles & crowns (<a href="foodcakes.html#bundt">Bundt & Turk's head</a>) or fancy jewels. Enriched yeast breads share the same place at holiday tables. Think: 
<a href="easter.html#kulich">Kulich</a> (Russia, Easter), <a href="easter.html#colomba">Colomba</a> (Italy, Easter) and <a href="christmasfood.html#twelfthnight">Twelfth Night Cake</a>
(England & France, Christmas--Mardi Gras)
<p>
On the human level? Cakes are served at special occasions (birthdays, weddings, holidays, funerals)
because they represent our best culinary offering honoring our most loved people. In "olden times" when refined sugar, spices, nuts, and
dried fruit were expensive, it was an honor to be honored with cake. Today cake isn't super expensive and we have many 
choices (store bought, box mix, scratch, bakery special order) but the message remains constant. Cake says: you're important 
and we love you. 
<p>
"People have consumed cakes of all kinds throughout history and at all sorts of ceremonial
occasions.  In
today's world, people traditionally serve cakes at holidays, birthdays, weddings, funerals, and
baptisms--in
short, at all significant times in the cycle of life. The tradition of eating cake on ceremonial
occaisions has its
basis in ancient ritual. Cakes, in the ancient world, had ties with the annual cycle, and people used
them as
offerings to the gods and spirits who exercised their powers at particular times of the year...The
Chinese
made cakes at harvest time to honor their moon goddess, Heng O. They recognized that the moon
played
a crucial role in the seasonal cycle, so they made round cakes shaped like the moon to reward the
lunar
goddess, with an image of the illustrious Heng O stamped on top...
     "The Russians traditionally pay their respects in spring to a deity named Maslenitsa by making
blini, thin
pancakes they call sun cakes...The pagan Slavs were not the only people to make round cakes to
celebrate the spring sun. The ancient Celts, who celebrated Beltane on the first day of spring,
baked and
ate Beltane cakes as a important part of their celebration...At the Beltane festival, the ancient
Celts also
rolled the cakes down a hill to imitate solar movement. Rolling the cakes, they hoped, would
ensure the
continued motion of the sun. This activity also served as a form of divination: If the cake broke
when it
reached the bottom of the hill, the Celts believed that whoever rolled it would die within a year's
time; but if
the cake remained intact, they believed that person would reap a year's good fortune...Agricultural
peoples
around the globe made offerings of cakes prepared from the grains and fruits that arose from the
soil. The
types of ingredients used to make these cakes contributed to their symbolism...The cake's size and
shape
were equally symbolic of its ritual purpose...round cakes symbolized the sun or the moon...All of
these
cakes had definative links to the myths the people embraced."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Cake mixes</b></font><br>
Dry  baking mixes of all sorts were a product of the Industrial Revolution. They were promoted
by companies as convenience foods. The first dry mixes (custard powders) were produced in
England in the 1840s. Packaged mixes for gelatin (Jell-O, Royal, Knox)
were introduced in the late 19th century. Pancake mixes (Aunt Jemima) were available in the
1890s. Our sources indicate packaged mixes for cake were introduced in 1920's. Packaged mixes for biscuits 
(Bisquick/General Mills) were introduced in the 1930s. 
Betty Crocker/General Mills made them famous in the late 1940s. 
Now we have mixes for Tiramasu, Pineapple-Upside-Down-Cake and even more complicated items.

<b>Betty Crocker</b><br>
"General Mills, firmly rooted in grain products--Gold Medal Flour, Bisquick, Softasilk, Wheaties,
and Cheerios--embraced cake mixes, but Betty was a late arrival to the party. O. Duff and Sons, a
molasses company, pioneered the "quick mix" filled by marketing the first boxed cake mix in the late 1920s or early 1930s. Continental Mills, the Hills Brothers Company under the Dromedary
label, Pillsbury, Occident, Ward Baking Company, and the Doughnut Corporation all produced
versions of cake mixes before World War II. But problems of spoilage and packaging abounded,
keeping mixes from widespread consumption and acceptance. In November 1947, after four years
of cake mix research and development, General Mills' test markets were exposed to the "Just Add
Water and Mix!" campaign for Betty Crocker's Ginger Cake. After a final assurance from the
corporate chemists that the boxed ingredients would indeed perform as advertised, the mix was
made available for limited distribution on the West Coast. Within a year it made a national debut
that excluded the South (presumably, product testing there proved futile). While Ginger Cake
required a nine-inch-square pan, designers projected that the PartyCake line, already in
development, would offer home bakers a choice of using either two square pans or one
9-inch-by-13-inch rectangular pan, a size and shape that were becoming popular. As layer cakes
are a
uniquely American creation, they seemed a fitting choice for PartyCake, the next wave of Betty
Crocker mixes. The layered butter PartyCake mixes--in Spice, Yellow, and White cake
varieties--and Devils Food Cake Mix were priced at $.35 to $.37 per red-and-white box. "High
impact"
colors were essential to entice "the ladies who trundle their little shopping wagons among the
shelves and tables" of the supermarket...The postwar quest for cake mix supremacy unfolded
much like the flour wars of the 1920s. In 1948 Pillsbury was the first to introduce a chocolate
cake mix. Duncan Hines stormed the market in 1951 with "Three Star Surprise Mix," a
three-flavor wonder in that in three weeks captured a 48 percent share."<br>

"Betty Crocker had always stood for quality in the minds of consumers, but during the first half of
the twentieth century,
convenience foods were not associated with good eating. All that changed in 1947, when the first
Betty Crocker cake
mixes hit America's shelves. The debut mix was labled Ginger Cake but would soon evolved into
Gingerbread Cake and
Cookie Mix. Devil's Food Layer Cake and Party Layer Cake Mix-products that offered an
alternative to the time-consuming process of baking a cake from scratch-soon followed. The early
mixes bearing the Betty Crocker label
eventually yielded more than 130 cooking and baking products."<br>

<b>Who invented Duncan Hines brand cake mixes?</b><br>
Mr. Arlee Andre, food chemist, 1952. Notes here:
<p>
"Arlee Andre, creator of the original Duncan Hines cake mixes, died Monday. He was 89 years old...Mr. Andre was a cereal
chemist testing flour for Nebraska Consolidated Mills in Omaha in 1952 when he decided to develop a cake mix with better flavor
and uniformity than the two mixes then available. He researched the best ways to make yellow cake, white cake, chocolate cake
and angel food cake. When the mixes were ready to be marketed, Nebraska Consolidated Mills paid Duncan Hines, the food and drink
connoisseur, a penny a box to use his name. The mixes quickly became popular and were sold to the Proctor & Gamble Company in 
1956. Mr. Andre also moved to Procter & Gamble and retired in the mid 1960s."<br>
---"Arlee Andre, 89, Dies; Creator of Cake Mixes," <i>New York Times</i>, September 9, 1989 (p. 9)
<p>
"A few weeks ago local newspapers carried full page color ads announcing that Duncan Hines cake-mixes were being introduced to the
Chicago market. Simultaneously, on tables in restaurants throughout the city, there appeared small placards which read, 
"Welcome to Chicago, Mr. Hines." Dunring the week, the gentleman himself, known to American travelers as the author of 
"Adventures in Good Eating," appeared on 13 radio and TV broadcasts here, and one evening he entertained 400 retailers at supper in
the plush Mayfair room of the Hotel Blackstone. Members of the flour-milling industry might well cock an eye at such ballyhoo and
goings-on. Per capita flour consumption in the U.S. is 133 pounds, and has hovered at that low point for the past three years. In view
of such statistics, many a miller would give his eye teeth to hit on a success formula like the one now setting sales records for
Nebraska Consolidated Milling Co....Sixteen months ago, this Omaha milling company was just another of the many medium-sized
companies in the industry, struggling to maintain sales. At the end of its fiscal year in June, 1951, the company had sales of $26 million.
My the next fiscal-year-end, June 1952, it had chalked up sales of $20 million, of which over $3 million were in cake-mixes alone.
Currently, it's selling about $9.5 million a har in cake-mixes. Furthermore, it's nipping at the heels of the "big three"
 in the cake mix field, Pillsbury, General Mills and General Foods, which combined do almost 90% of the business. Consolidated now
ranks fourth, doing most of the remaining 10%, although it sells in only 30 states. J. Allan Mactier, Consolidated's 30-year-old
vice-president...explains the management's success formula thus: 'Make sure you have a good product, pick a sure-fire brand name, 
and pour on the merchandising.' Consolidated chose the Duncan Hines label which is uses through a a franchise with Hines Park 
Foods, Inc. of Ithaca N.Y. because it felt it would be a sure-fire' seller. Mr. Hines himself makes his headquarters in Bowling
Green, Ky. The company believed Mr. Hines' already established reputation as a connoisseur of good food would do the trick...
What usually results is a flood of publicity which supplements the company's own concentrated advertising in the local
market...Consolidated literally blitzes a town when it moves in. Color ads, so necessary in food promotion, are splashed on billboards
and in local papers. Many radio and TV spots are used, as well as redemption coupons. Consolidated uses its quality claim as part
of its selling technique. Unlike many cake mixes which contain powdered eggs in this mix, Duncan Hines mixes call for the additon of two
fresh eggs. Mr. Hines insisted on this, stating it would make a better cake and would pay off in the long run. Duncan Hines
brand mixes sell at competitive prices with other mixes, and the firm tries to turn the added expense of two fresh eggs to a 
selling advantage by telling the housewife 'this will make a better cake,' because Mr. Hines, the food authority, says so...
The company is shooting for national distribution sometime next year."<br>

"The Duncan Hines line of prepared mixes includes a variety of cake mixes, a pancake mix, a muffin mix, brownie mix and several other
mix products. They are among the sales leaders in the 30 midwestern and Pacific Coast states where they are now sold...Mr. Hines, 
who edits the guidebooks bearing his nane and has concerned himnself primarily with quality standards of the licensed products, will
continue in his present capacity."<br>

"Two or three times a week during the tourist season, travelers pull up in front of a neat, Colonial house on the edge of [Bowling
Green, Kentucky] and inquire. 'How soon will dinner be ready?' They're attracted by a sign on the lawn: 'Home Office, Duncan
Hines.' Mr. Hines who has built a nationwide reputation by telling people where to dine, doesn't serve any meals at his
combination office and home here. But he concedes it is flattering that people think of him when they are hungry. 'Every day in this
country, more than 70 million people eat out,' he explains. Helping them decide which restaurants to choose is the foundation
for a prospering enterprise that first started in 1936. In that year, Mr. Hines compiled his first directory of recommended
restaurants throughout the U.S., 'Adventures in Good Eating.' Since then the book has become a sort of Baedeker of American
Cuisine. Through the years Mr. Hines has added three other guides--'Lodging for a Night," "Adventures in Good Cooking," and 
'Vacation Guide.'...Much of his time is spent in updating the guides to eliminate establishments that have fallen below his
standards. He adds new discoveries when he runs across them. To help him keep track of the 2,500 eateries...on his 
recommended list, he enlists a corps of 600 friends scattered across the country. When a place changes hands, they report 
whether it still qualifies for a Hines approval. So far, Mr. Hines hasn't found any eating place in his native Bowling
Green that he can recommend. He hasn't endeared himself to fellow Kentuckians by his comment that much of the locality is cursed
with 'greese cooking.'...A public eating place, to get on the Hines list, must pass a rigorous inspection. He admires well-polished silver
and white table cloths in the dining room. Often he insists on visitng the kitchen to inspect garbage disposal and 
dishwashing. Mr. Hines got to know the good and bad of roadside hashing when he was a salesman of printing and advertising
for Rogers & Co., of Chicago. Friends began asking him for recommendations. Mr. Hines mailed out a printed list of his
favorites as a gift before he realized the project might have commercial possibilities. Books are only a part of the present-day
enterprise. Perhaps the biggest moneymaker is a line of 150 foods which bear his name. Hines-Park Food, Inc., of Ithaca, N.Y.,
packages the victuals. Mr. Hines receives a royalty on each package sold. He's looking for sales of around 24 million packages
of Duncan Hines cake mix this year and will collect one-half cent royalty on each. Under a separate agreement, some 94 firms make
Duncan Hines ice cream. Mr. Hines maintains a testing laboratory at Bowling Green to keep it up to specification...The money from
all his books goes into the Duncan Hines Foundation which provides scholarships for seniors taking courses in restaurant and hotel
management at Cornell University and Michigan State College. The National Sanitation Foundation also shares in book profits."<br>

<b>In Mr. Hines' own words:</b><br>
"My interest in Wayside inns is not the expression of a gourmand's appetite for fine foods but the result of a recreational impulse
to do something 'different,' to play a new game that would intrigue my wife and give me her companionship in my hours of
relaxation from a strenuous and exacting business. Upon purchasing our first car, we decided to see as much of America as possible,
to test its outstanding food, to met interesting people along the way and bring home with us from each trip a lot of pleasant
memories that we could keep stored away in our minds to feast on in later years. The idea appealed to Mrs. Hines for she 
apparently liked to 'go places' with her husband better than anything else...My first discovery was that the highways were crowded with
gasoline pilgrims whose main interest seemed to be the relative merits of inns. They fairly oozed informatino about the places
we ought not to miss. Of course, I took careful notes on this information--that being a part of the game we were playing for
our own amusement. Most of these tourists produced private lists of 'best places' and nearly all of them remarked that there ought 
to be a reliable directory of the most desirable inns available to discriminating motorist. This idea intrigued me. After years of
travel over the highways I  found I had the names of several hundred inns, scattered over the country, the desirablility of which
was enthusiastically vouched for by those who had patronized them. So we set out to visit as many as possible to check up on reports
given us, for you know there is not accounting for tastes in food any more than there is in clothing, printing or marriage."<br>

"A new dessert-mix called Py-O-My pudding is being introduced by Kitchen Arts Foods of Chicago in chain stores here, including 
Bohacks, King Kullen and Peter Reeves. Requiring no more than thirty minutes for preparation, including cooking time, the packaged
product comes in three flavors, vanilla, chocolate and caramel. Such convenience, of course, means some sacrifice in quality. The
pudding is a bit too coarse-grained to meet the standards of really fine cookery. But the flavor is pleasing, especially in the 
caramel and chocolate puddings. Topped with whipped cream, the dessert is exceedingly appetizing. And the preparation is easy.
Contents of the larger of two paper bags are emptied into a bowl. A third of a cup of milk is added, the mixture is beaten for one
minute and poured into a casserole or other baking dish. After sprinkling the dry 'sauce' of the smaller bag over the batter, one and 
one-quarter cups of water are poured over the mixture. No further stirring is necessary; the dish goes immediately into a 450-degree oven.
Directions on the package suggest baking for twenty minutes, but in <i>The New York Times'</i> test kitchen we got better results by allowing
another five minutes of cooking."<br>

<b>Consumer reaction</b><br>
According to the food historians, early baking mixes were not readily accepted. Why? Two reasons: (1) They were not
reliable and they produced inconsistent results. (2) 
Home cooks had a
difficult time reconciling modern convenience with traditional expectations. When food companies
make things too
simple their products are summarily rejected. Even in today's culture of ultra-convenience, this
holds true. The <a href="foodcakes.html#snackincake">"Snack'n
Cake"</a> lesson. 
<p>
What Pillsbury/Betty Crocker hoped to achieve after World War II initally backfired because
home cooks felt
compelled/obligated to return to the way things were. Like mom used to cook. They say good
salesmen don't take "no"
for an answer. America's largest food concerns obviously hired these men. Despite the fact that
early mixes often
produced less than satisfactory results and invoke a complicated set of psycho-social baggage,
they prevailed.
Eventually mixes were accepted. Today? Most people who make cakes for people they love
regularly employ mixes
(universally perceived as home-made, as in "made in the home") instead of buying a premade
"cake in the box." The real
<a href="foodcakes.html#scratch">"scratch cake"</a> is very nearly lost. 
<p>
"The very marketable premise behind cake mixes was, and still is, the ability to have a fresh,
"home-made" cake with very little time and effort. Though Betty Crocker--like her
competitors--promised that cake mixes offered freshness, ease, and flavor in a box, the market
was slow to
mature. Puzzled, marketers reiterated the message that homemakers need only drop this scientific
marvel into a bowl, add water, mix, and bake. But that was still a little too good to be true for
Mrs. Comsumer America. Certainly, cake mixes sold, but--compared with the early performance
of Bisquick or Aunt Jemima pancake mix--not up to industry expecations. The "quick
mix"...industry, eager to correct the shortfall, conducted research even as the development of new
mixes continued. General Mills considered the market research of the business psychologists Dr.
Burleigh Gardner and Dr. Ernest Dichter to explain the mediocre sales of cake mixes. The
problem, according to the psychologists, was eggs. Dichter, in particular, believed that powdered
eggs, often used in cake mixes, should be left out, so women could add a few fresh eggs into the
batter, giving them a sense of creative contribution. He believed...that baking a cake was an act of
love on the woman's part; a cake mix that only needed water cheapened that love. Whether the
psychologists were right, or whether cakes made with fresh eggs simply taste better than cakes
made with dried eggs, General Mills decided to play up the fact that Betty Crocker's cake mixes
did not contain...dried eggs of any kind...Before long, cake mix started to gain some acceptance
and notoriety; even Mamie Eisenhower instructed her cooking staff to use this novel invention at
the White House."<br>

<b>What did <i>Consumer Reports</i> think of these early mixes?</b><br>
<b>[1944]</b><br>
"Three types of cake mixes were found by CU's shoppers: two brands of devil's food, two lemon-flavored yellow cakes and a spice
cake. All four included vegetable shortening, sugar, powdered egg, powdered skim milk, salt, baking powder (or soda and phosphate) and flavoring in their ingredients. The devil's food types added cocoa, and the spice cake, various spices and cocoa. <i>Helen's Red-E</i>
Devil Food Mix, which received the highest rating, was made with enriched wheat flour and oat flour. The Spiced Cake Mix of the same
brand, considered fairly good, contained some soya flour. The cake mixes were tested for rising quality, color of crust and crumb,
grain, texture, flavor and aroma. The last three, considered together as a palatability, were the chief factors in the ratings."
<p>
<b>Cake Mixes</b> Acceptable (In estimated order of quality)<br>
<b>Helen's Red-E Devil Food Mix</b> (Gann Prod. Co.). 30 cents for 16 oz. (30 cents). Enriched wheat flour and oat flour. Excellent
flavor. Available in California, Oregon and Nevada.<br>
<b>X-Pert Devil's Food Mix</b> (Modern Foods, Inc.). 18 cents for 14 1/4 oz. (19.9 cents). Excellent flavor. Grain rather coarse,
but probably normal for this type of cake. Available East of the Mississippi.<br>
<b>Helen's Red-E Yellow Cake Mix </b> (Gann Prod. Co.). 30 cents for 1 lb. (30 cents). Wheat, cottonseed and oat flour. Excellent
flavor, slightly lemon. Available in California, Oregon and Nevada.<br>
<b>Joy Golden Layer Cake</b> (Cramer Products Co., NYC). 20 cents for 14 oz. (33.1 cents). Very good flavor, slightly lemon. 
Available nationally.<br>
<b>Helen's Red-E Spiced Cake Mix</b> (Gann Prod. C.). 30 cents for 1 lb. (30 cents). Wheat flour and soya flour. Good flavor, nutmeg
mace. Available in California, Oregon and Nevada."<br>
---"Baking Mixes," <i>Consumer Reports</i>, July 1944 (p. 179-180)
<p>
<b>[1948]</b><br>
"Delectable-looking cakes, biscuits, muffins, rolls, pies and other baked goods peer forth these days, not only from the baker's
showcase, but from the paper labels on the grocer's shelves. They are "come on's" for the prepared flour mixes now appearing
in ever greater numbers and variety. When CU's shoppers throughout the nation had bought all of the types and brands of mixes
containing flour (except pancake mixes) which they found on the market, they had 76--more than three times as many as were
available in 1944 when CU last tested these products. How good are they? The value of any mix to a housewife is based on the 
quality of the finished product--how good it is to eat--plus ease and convenience of preparation, and cost. CU consultants
subjected all products to actual baking tests, following the directions given on the packages. The scores for cake, gingerbread,
biscuit, muffin and hot roll mixes were based on flavor, volume or the amount of rise, texture, or tenderness of crumb to feel 
and taste, aroma while warm from baking, grain or physical structure of the crumb and color of crust and crumb...CU found some 
mixes that were good, many that were satisfactory, and only two that were "Not Acceptable." Many brands were neither 
consistently good nor consistently poor...The preparation of mostt of these mixes calls for the addition only of water or milk, and
they can be stirred up so simply that, if directions are followed, there is little danger of their being spoiled. The time
required is negligable compared to that for mixing a cake from the basic ingredients. They are particularly useful for
emergencies, for youngsters just trying their culinary wings, or for the gang of teen-agers who what to take over the
kitchen for an evening. Cost varied considerably among different brands of the same type of mix, and while in some cases it was
greater than the comparable homemade product, in many cases, it was not more, or even less. <br>

"CU's consultants tested 20 bands of prepared cake mix--gingerbread, white cake, and devil's food. In the opinion of the
home economists who sampled them for taste and other qualities, none were as good as "mother used to bake." However, the best of 
the mixes made cakes nearly as good as those obtained with standard recipes. While they fall short of the best products of the
baker's art, ready mixes do have a number of advantages which may decide you to keep them on your pantry shelf. <b>They are
time savers.</b> In CU's tests the time saved by making a cake from prepared mix rather than a recipe, was about 15 minutes. 
Counting wash-up and put-away time of utensils, the mixes have an even greater edge. <b>They are work savers.</b> Use of a
prepared mix eliminates many of the steps necesary with standard recipes, such as the sifting of flour and the measuring of 
ingredients. Only one bowl is required. However, too little or too much mixing, or incorrect oven temperature, may still result 
in an unsuccessful cake. <b>They are economical.</b> The average cost of a two-layer devil's food cake (eight-inch layers) made
from a ready mix was 38c, including the cost of milk and eggs when their addition was required. This was appreciably less than the cost
of a standard recipe devil's food cake, which was 47c at the time of the tests in late January 1951. On the white cake and ginger cake,
however, the saving was less--only 2c in each case, on the average. Convenience, more than price, favors the use of the
prepared mix. With ready mixes, you are saved the necessity of storing ingredients used only occasionally...or remembering
to buy ingredients not normally used...In many cakes, you do not even have to have milk or eggs on hand to bake a cake. Ten
of the 20 mixes tested--all of the ginger cakes and several of the others--required the addition of water only. Occident
Devils Food Cake Mix required the addition of one egg; Betty Crocker Devil's Food Cake Mix and white cake, each required the
addition of two eggs...Mixing directions are given for both hand beating and for the use of an electric mixer in most cases.
A few brands even carry directions for use in high altitude regions. Swans Down, and some others, provide a "special formula" mix for
high altitude baking. Packaging also carry instructions for making cookies, cup cakes, or glamorized versions of the basic
cake for which the mix was intended. It is apparent that there are good reasons for the growing popularity of the mixes. However, if you
have the skill to bake a really fine cake, and your taste or the occasion demands the best, you should follow your own prized
recipe."<br>

<b>[1953]</b><br>
"Not so very long ago, the housewife who went to the bakery store to get her family's dessert, instead of producing it from her 
own oven, was looked at askance by her more industrious neighbors. Today there seems to be at least a fair prospect that the
situation will be reversed. For the grocery store shelves are replete with ready-mix-cake packages in great variety, and the description
of their preparation sounds so simple as to make a trip to the bakery store, by comparison, a major chore. In an attempt to 
answer the question of whether or not the ready-mix cakes are indeed as easy to prepare as package instructions indicate, and whether
the end products are of such quality as to justify their use, CU surved the field of prepared mixes for white cake, yellow cake, 
devil's food cake, and gingergread. Eight brands of devil's food mix, seven brands of white and of yellow cake mix, and three 
brands of gingerbread were tested. Four samples of each mix were stirred up and baked, two operators preparing two samples
of each. These were submitted, without band identification, independently to each of three judges, along with a piece of cake of 
similar character made from home-mixed batter. Judgement was passed on each piece about two hours after its removal from the oven, and
again (to determine keeping qualities) a day later. The judges, who are trained home economists, used a score system to rate flavor,
texture, appearance, grain, color, and shape of the cakes; in addition, they expressed an overall opinion of each 
cake's quality. There was suprisingly little disagreement, among the individual judges, as to the visible characteristics of the 
various products, but in flavor preference they often did not agree, which is hardly surprising. However, in the extremes of taste--
cakes rated either oudstandingly good or very poor--there was little dispute among them. In terms of general quality, many of the 
the cakes made from the packaged mixes competed successfully against the home-made cakes, which were carefully prepared from well-
tested recipes. (The recipes were for cakes of average richness in the selected types. This is not to say that your
own favorite recipe won't produce a cake finer than any mix on the market!). Most of the ready-mix cakes were a pleasing in shape,
volume, and general appearance as the home-made cakes, and mnay had very good texture and fine grain-structure, too. It was in 
flavor that the home-made cakes outranked most--but not all--of the mixes. As for the preparation of the mix-made cakes, it's almost
as simple as the advertisiments claim. For most of the mixes, the housewife need only add a measured amount (usually a cupful,
 more or less) of milk or water to the solid ingredients in the box, stir the two together, pour the mixture into greased pans, and 
bake in a preheated oven. For a few, an egg or two, or some flavoring, is required in addition. Only one brand, Betty Crocker, 
received a Good rating in all four of the varieties tested...None of the others were consistently superior, though there were 
individual cake types of other brands which were at least equal of Betty Crocker."<br>

<b>Cake mix market & demographics [1956]</b><br>
"Cake mix makers are finding that a popualr new product, a helping of fast-rising sales and a quick stir do not always make a recipe
for sweet profits. When cake mixes were introduced after World War II, they caught on immediately and fit right into the parade toward 
ever-greater consumer convenience--along with frozen foods, automatic washers, automatic car shcifts and power lawn mowers. Sales
soard twelvefold in the past eight years, turing the easy mixes into a $225 million a year business. But this success story has taken a rather
unhappy turn for the cake mix makers. New mixes, and new manufacturers rushed into the suddenly expanding field. The result:
Feverish competition, marked by price cutting and big promotion outlays,--and sharly pared profit margins. 'I don't see how
any of them are making any money,' says the president of a concern that dropped out of cake mix competition. 'They are just hoping for
future profits.' National Biscuit Co.'s Dromedary Mix division advertising director...agrees, and calls the mix business generally 
'now a loss operation.' Pillsbury Mills., Inc., with one-third of the cake mix business, concedes profits declined last year because of
price wars and the cost of 'extraordinary heavy advertising and promotional programs.' Nebraska Consolidated Millls Co.
which had the Duncan Hines brand of mixes and an estimated 11% of cake mix sales, recently sold out its mix line after five years
because...other milling activities were more profitable. Two other mix makers, General Foods Corp., with the Swans Down
 brand and giant General Mills, Inc., with about one-third of the market, refuse to discuss the finances of their cake mix lines.
...Zooming sales leave little doubt the housewife has made cake mxies a permanent addition to her kitchen shelf. Sales totaled about 
568 million packages in the year ended last June 1, compared with only 50 million packages in the 1947-1948 year. Mix executives
figure 80% of all homes now use at least one mix cake each year. Slightly over half of all cakes baked, they reckon, use the 
mixes, and General Mills statistician...predicts the toal eventually will reach 66%, possibly even 70% or 75%. 'When an 
elderly woman dies,' comments one mix executive, 'the flour and shortening business loses a customer. When a young girl 
marries, the mix business gains a customer.'...New flavors are almonst constantly being tested or brough out by cake mix makers. 
In addition to the common white, yellow, and chocoalte mixes, such delights as orange, caramel, spice, burnt sugar marble, confetti angel food, 
butterscotch, apple chip and sponge cake mixes are available...Cake sizes are bing tailored nowadays to suit individual needs. 
Smaller type cakes have been designed for the two or three-person family. Called an 'Answer Cake' by General Mills (because it 
'answered letter demands for a smaller cake') and the 'Kit Cake' by Pillsbury,t ehse mixes include regular mix, frosting mix and a
foil pan all in one carton. Chelsea Milling Co. of Chelsea, Mich., puts out an almost pocket sized box of mix selling for
10 cents that makes a small one-layer cake...Historically, mixes aren't new. The granddaddy  proabaly is the pancake mix, 
developed in the early 1920's and produced shortly after then by Quaker Oats with its Aunt Jemima brand. Next development was the 
biscuit mix, brought out in the ealry 1930's by General Mills with its 'Bisquick' mix. Shortly before World War II broke out, the
gingerbread mix was introduced. But it wasn't until after the war that cake mixes made theri entrance. Housewives who insist on 
baking home made cakes get little consolation when comparing costs with a ready mix cake. A General Mills statistician calculates that a 
common white, yellow or devils food cake costs from 47 to 51 cents using ordinary flour, six cents more using special cake flour 
(not a mix) and dix cents more if butter shortening is used."<br>

<b>High Altitude Cake Mixes</b><br>
Long before commercial cake mixes, mountain cooks adjusted traditional recipes for high altitudes. Caroline Trask Norton's <i>Rocky Mountain Cook Book</i> [1903]
is considered one of the first texts specifically addressing high altitude cookery. 
Our survey of historic newspapers confirms Pillsbury conducted high altitude testing in 1949, using a WWII era 
high altitude simulator. Betty Crocker appears to be the first major commercial brand to feature high altitude directions on mix packages. Both brands are owned by 
General Mills.
<p>
<b>[1949] </b><br>
This article appeared in several newspapers in 1949. It provides additional details regarding Pillsbury's pioneering efforts to create fail-proof high altitude baking
 mixes. Would love to see a picture of this kitchen!!! <p>
"It's getting so a housewife won't have a single alibi left if her cake turns out a flop. The experts are using aviation science to wipe out one excuse that a lot of 
tough-luck bakers maybe even thought of. That's atmospheric pressure. It seems there's a lot of difference between baking a cake in Herkimer, N.Y. and whipping 
one up in Denver, Colo. This is particularly true with the packaged cake mixes now so popular with grandma, bride and the professional baker. Adjustments must
 be made in baking recipes to allow for the low air pressure of high places and accompanying variations in moisture content. A recipe providing a perfect light cake
 in Herkimer might result in something as flat as a cold omelet in high altitude Denver. One of the nation's big millers (Pillsbury) worked out the problem through 
aviation science. Cakes were baked in a 'flying kitchen' that went up to 7,000 feet without leaving the ground. The aerial kitchen in a pressure chamber used by the
 U.S. army air force at Rochester, Minn., to conduct altitude tests on humans during the last war. The company formerly spent considerable time and money
 sending food researchers to high altitude cities to determine variations needed in cake mix formulas. When the pressure chamber idea jelled, all that had to be done 
was check the elevation of a city. Then a couple of girls from the company's research and development department 'took off' with their mixing bowls to turn out a 
test cake. 'Captain' of the cake mix flight missions was Miss Mary Kimball. Her crew consisted of one inside helper on each 'flight.' The pressure chamber, which
 still has man of its air force fittings--earphones, microphones, oxygen masks and gauges--is equipped with a small electric stove, large enough to bake one cake. 
The chamber, a large steel tank anchored horizontally on a solid foundation, is divided into two compartments separated by an air lock. A vault-like door seals the 
chamber during an experiment. before the girls took off for an experiment they baked a control cake on the ground. The ascent was made at the rate of 1,000 feet a 
minute. When they reached a previously determined altitude the cake mix was turned on and the weighing, measuring and baking started. They were up about four
 hours on each flight. While the testers were in the air, technicians outside the chamber watched gauges to maintain proper pressure. Other home economists peered
 through glassed portholes to observe the flying bakers. When the test cake came out of the oven, Miss Kimball seized a microphone to announce the baking
 mission completed and the oven ready to land. Miss Kimball and her crew members have baked about 200 cakes in 64 'logged flights.' The aerial cakes are 
measured and judged against known standards first as they come out of the oven and later in Minneapolis laboratories. So if you want to bake a cake on top of a 
29,000 foot Mt. Everest, don't guess at the recipe. Try it in a pressure chamber first."<br>

"High Altitude Cooking. The prepared mix which a Manhattan housewife makes a perfect cake would yield one as flat as a pancake if it were cooked in a city 
10,000 feet above sea level. The effect of altitude on baking has posed a problem for manufacturers who distribute such mixes on a nation-wide scale. They've had
 to change the formulas for the products they sell in areas of high elevation. One of the most interesting procedures for testing these recipes is that employed by 
Pillsbury Mills. Pillsbury's home economists do their experimental work on the various formulas in a 'flying kitchen' This laboratory never actually leaves the ground, 
for it is a low-pressure chamber, once used by the Army Air Force to conduct high altitude tests. In this way the research can be done right at the plant in 
Rochester, Minn.--a less expensive undertaking than sending workers and equipment out in the field to cities of different elevations. At 'flight' time the home 
economists enter the chamber which they've fixed into a tiny kitchen. They give a signal and the door of their kitchen is locked, A technician at the controls outside
 regulates the pressure so that the kitchen 'climbs' at the rate of about a thousand feet per minute...Chewing gum and sipping water to relive the pressure on their
 ears, the home economists begin their tests. The higher the altitude, the lower the temperature inside the cake while it is baking. This weakens the structural strength
 derived from the flour and eggs in the batter. To counteract this, it's necessary to use less leavening and more liquid. But when the housewife buys a package of 
cake mix at the corner grocery, whether it be in this city or in mile-high Denver, Col., she's not likely to be aware of all this. The home economists at Pillsbury's have
 worked out a special formula for the mixes sold in cities with an elevation of more than 3,000 feet. Directions on the packages for areas with an altitude up to 
3,000 feet call for more liquid than those sold in sea-level cities. But all three types of mixes come in the same sort of containers with only slight variations in the
 wording on the labels. The company gives to the distributors and the grocers the responsibility for seeing that a housewife gets the kind of mix designed for 'baking
 at the altitude at which she lives."<br>

<b>About cooking "from scratch"</b><br>
According to the <i> Oxford English Dictionary</I> (OED), the word "scratch" has several
meanings. The
phrase "from scratch" is derived from this:

used ellipt.
for such a competitor. From scratch, from a position of no advantage, knowledge, influence, etc.,
from
nothing."

The classic story behind the name "angel food cake" is that this dessert is so white, light, and
fluffy it must be fit for angels. Who thought up this name? No one knows. We do know [from the
study of old cookbooks] that cake recipes with the name "angel food" began showing up in
American cookbooks sometime in the late nineteenth century, about the same time as
mass-produced bakeware hit the popular market. <a href="foodcakes.html#devilsfood">Devils Food</a>, dense chocolately rich and "sinful,"

       Some food historians speculate the Pennsylvania Dutch were probably the original makers
and namers of angel food, though this connection has not been fully documented. In support of
the theory, one of many culinary traditions introduced to America by the Pennsyvania Dutch was
the cake mold, a special metal pan for creating festive cakes in unusual shapes. A recipe for
"Amanda's Angel Food Cake" is included in the <i>Pennsylvania Dutch Cook Book of Time Old

"Angel-food cake...Also "angel cake." A very light, puffy cake, perhaps of  Pennsylvania-Dutch

One cup of flour, measured after one sifting, and then mixed with one teaspoonful of cream of
tartar and sifted four times. Beat the whites of eleven eggs, with a wire beater or perforated
spoon, until stiff and flaky. Add one cup and a half of the fine granulated sugar, and beat again;
add one teaspoonful of vanilla or almond, then mix in the flour quickly and lightly. Line the
bottom and funnel of a cake pan with paper not greased, pour in the mixture, and bake about forty
minutes. When done, loosen the cake around the edge, and turn out at once. Some persons have
been more successful with this cake by mixing the sugar with the flour and cream of tartar, and
adding all at aonce to the beaten egg."<br>

approval of Los Angeles homemakers. Everyone who tries it is surprised by the cake's delicate flavor and good texture...There's a 14-egg package and a 
medium 8-egg one. The egg whites and all essential ingredients are scientifically measured and proportions into two little transparent 
paper bags contained in each box. The dry ingredients are beaten several minutes with a cupful of cold water and the other batter is read! 
many inquiries have come to this department about the product. We tested several samples for its quality, ease of preparation and 
cost. Our verdict is favorable on all counts...Unfortunately, the mix is not yet available in all food markets, but city-wide 
distribution is under way, and we recommend that you ask for it at your store when next you shop. Most grocers appreciate

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Chocolate cake</b></font><br>
In the beginning, <a href="foodcandy.html#chocolate">chocolate</a> was a precious substance used for religions ceremonies. 
When chocolate was introduced to Europe, other possibilities were explored. Confections, icings, puddings and baked goods
embraced chocolate flavor. 
<p>
What is chocolate cake? Excellent question with no simple answer. In the first half of the 19th century the typical chocolate cake was a yellow or spice cake 
meant to accompany  a <a href="foodbeverages.html#cocoa">chocolate beverage</a>. In the second quarter of the 19th
century the typical chocolate cake was either a white or yellow cake with chocolate icing. It is not until the middle of 
the 19th century we begin to see chocolate as an ingredient in baked goods (cookies, cakes). Progress was slow. By the beginning of the
20th century chocolate cakes, as we know them today, proliferate. Why? Consumer economics, product availability and serious 
corporate marketing.
<p>
<a name="sadechocolate">
The oldest print reference we find for baked goods with chocolate ingredient is 1779. In this letter sent from prison, the 
notorious Marquis De Sade complains bitterly to his wife about the "care" package she sent him.
<p>
Alphonse Francois, Marquis de Sade, primarily known for 'other activities,' nevertheless, mentioned chocolate in a series of letters written form prison addressed 
to his wife. In a most interesting letter dated May 16, 1779, he tersely complained of the quality of a food package she previously 
sent to him and enumerated his complaints. 'This sponge cake is not at all what I asked for: 1) I wanted it iced everywhere, both on top and 
underneath, with the same icing used on the little cookies; 2) I wanted it to be chocolate inside, of which it contains not the 
slightest hint; they have colored it with some sort of dark herb, but there is not what one could call the slightest 
suspicion of chocolate. The next time you send me a package, please have it made for me, and try to have some trustworthy person 
there to see for themselves that some chocolate is put inside. The cookies must smell of chocolate, as if one were biting into 
a chocolate bar.' This specific de Sade letter reveals several important pieces of information. First, the letter hints that the so-called 
chocolate cookies were prepared from adulterated chocolate...Second, the concluding sentence suggests that bars of chocolate for eating 
pleasure were available in Paris nearly 50 years before Van Houten's invention of the cocoa press, an invention that some have 
interpreted as a necessary 'tipping-point' required before the development of confectionary chocolate. In 18th century Europe and elsewhere, 
consumers did not 'bite into' standard chocolate tablets. These tablets whether circular, rectangular, or appearing as 
'globs' were not eaten like 20th and 21st century candy bars; these tablets were grated and used to prepare chocolate beverages. Thus, 
the phrase 'biting into' reveals the probability that bars of confectionary chocolate circulated in France by this early
 date." <br>

The earliest baked good recipe we find (so far)with chocolate as ingredient is from 1847. While it confirms the use of chocolate
in this capacity, it by no means indicates this was a common practice in the day.

Recipes for rich, chocolate cakes similar to devil's food were fairly
common in late 19th century cookbooks, but they were not named such.
They were typically listed under the generic name "chocolate cake." Recipes titled <a href="foodcakes.html#devilsfood">devil's food</a>
proliferated, sometimes with interesting and creative twists) in the first decades of the 20th
century. <a href="foodcakes.html#reddevil">Red Devil</a> appears in the 1930s.
<p>
"Devil's food.
A cake, muffin, or cookie made with dark chocolate, so called because it is supposedly so rich and
delicious that it must be somewhat sinful, although the association is clearly made with humor. Its
dark color contrasted with the snowy white of angel-food cake, an earlier confection. The first
devil's food recipe appeared in 1900, after which recipes and references became frequent in
cookbooks. The "red devil's food cake," given a reddish-brown color by the mixture of cocoa and
baking soda, is post-World War II version of the standard devil's food cake."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar Friedman:New
York] 1999 (p. 111)
<p>
Angel food belongs to the nineteenth century but devil's food to the twentieth. How this
chocolate cake came to be called devil's food no one knows although it may have been a play on
opposites: it was as dark and rich as angel food was light an airy...In the early 1900s there were a
number of bizarre variations on Devils Food Cake. Once called for mashed potatoes and a number
for ground cinnamon and cloves in addition to chocolate..."<br>
---<i>American Century Cookbook: The Most Popular Recipes of the 20th Century</i>, Jean
Anderson [Clarkson Potter:New York] 1997 (p. 452-3)
<p>
Some food historians believe this might be the first mention of Devil's food. It appears in a
memoir written by Caroline King's of her childhood in 1880s Chicago. Ms. King was a popular
food writer in the 1920s-1930s.
<p>
<blockquote>
"Devil's Food, though a new cake in our household, had made its dashing appearance in Chicago
in the middle eighties, and by the time it reached our quiet little community, was quite the rage.
Maud's receipt was the original one, and made a large, dark, rich cake. Here it is:
<p>
<b>Devil's Food</b><br>
1/2 cup butter<br>
2 cups sugar<br>
5 eggs<br>
1 cup sour cream<br>
2 1/2 cups flour<br>
1 scant teaspoon soda<br>
1 teaspoon baking powder<br>
3 squares unsweetened chocolate<br>
1 teaspoon vanilla.
<p>
Anna melted the chocolate over hot water while Maude creamed the butter and added the sugar
gradually; then she whipped in the slightly beaten yolks of the eggs and the melted chocolate and
vanilla. I was permitted to sift and measure the flour and then sift it again with the baking powder
and soda. When this was done, Maude alternately added the flour mixture and the sour cream to
the egg-sugar-butter-chocolate combination. Last of all, she folded in the stiffly beaten whites of
the eggs and turned the delicious-smelling brown batter into three layer-cake pans which Anna
had buttered and floured. The baking, in a very moderate oven, was carefully watched. According
to a time-honored custom in our family, the cakes were tested with a clean broomstraw and when
finished were turned, beautifully brown and entrancingly fragrant, from the pans onto a clean
towel.
   Now came the next important part, the icing and filling. The Watermans' receipt called for a
thick boiled icing made pleasantly piquant with a few drops of citric acid. But citric acid sounded
dangerous to Maud, and besides, as Anna explained, we had no such article in our supply closet.
Even Emily's stock of special flavorings refused to yield it, so Maud used lemon juice, sparingly
and judiciously, and the result was perfect. 
   Altogether it was a noble cake, nobly made."<br>
---<i>Victorian Cakes: A Reminiscence With Recipes</i>, Caroline B. King, with an introduction
by Jill Gardner [Aris/Berkeley:1986] (p. 35-6)<br>

<p>
There is no recipe for Devil's food in <i>Favorite Dishes: A Columbian Autograph Souvenir
Cookery Book</i>, a collection of recipes contributed by prominent Chicago women in 1893.
This book, originally compiled by Carrie V. Shuman, was recently reissued by the University
Press, Chicago [2001].<p>
<b>What is the difference between chocolate cake and devil's food?</b><br> This simple
question has many
answers, depending upon the period and cookbook. As noted above, the first 19th century
American chocolate cake recipes were white/yellow cakes with chocolate icing. The addition of
chocolate to the batter increased as the price of this ingredient declined, thus creating "chocolate
cake" as we know it today.  20th century cookbooks often list chocolate cake and devils food on
the same page. The most predominant difference between the two? Devil's food usually contains a
greater proportion of  chocolate. Fannie Farmer [1923] doubles the amount of chocolate required
for her devil's food (4 ounces compared to 2 ounces for "regular" chocolate cake.). Irma S.
Rombauer confirms: "When the larger amount of chocolate is used, it is a black, rich Devil's
Food." (<i>Joy of Cooking</i>, 1931 p. 236)
<p>
Compare this chocolate cake recipe [1894] with Mrs. Rorer's [1902] & Good Housekeeping's
[1903] devil's food recipes
(below):<br>
<blockquote>
<b>Chocolate Cake, No. 3</b><br>
One and a half cups of sugar, half cup of butter, three-quarters cup of milk, three eggs and yolk
of another, two cups of flour, two teaspoons baking powder, one full cup of Baker's chocolate.
Break up the chocolate and put in a cup over the tea kettle until it melts. This will make four
layers, and use the following recipe for boiled icing between the layers.<p>
<b>Boiled icing</b><br>
One cup of sugar (granulated), quarter cup of water (cold), one egg (only white, beaten stiff). Put
water on sugar in a saucepan and let it boil until it threads. Then remove from fire and pour over
the stiff white, beaten until it thickens. Put on the cake at once."<br>

<p>
The earliest recipe we have for Devil's Food printed in an American cookbook is dated 1902:
<blockquote>
<b>"Devil's Food</b><br>
1/2 cup of milk<br>
4 ounces of chocolate<br>
1/2 cup butter<br>
3 cups pastry flour<br>
1 1/2 cups of sugar<br>
4 eggs<br>
2 teaspoonfuls of baking powder
<br>
Put in a double boiler four ounces of chocolate and a half pint of milk; cook until smooth and
thick, and stand aside to cool. Beat a half cup of butter to a cream; add gradually one and a half
cups of sugar and the yolks of four eggs; beat until light and smooth. Then add the cool chocolate
mixture and three cups of pastry flour, with which you have sifted two teaspoonfuls of baking
powder. Beat thoroughly for at least five minutes; then stir in the well beaten whites of the eggs.
Bake in three or four layers. Put the layers together with soft icing, to which you have added a
cup of chopped nuts. The success of this cake depends upon the flour used."<br>

<p>
By 1913, devils food and devils cake were all the rage. How do we know? Anna Clair
Vangalder's <i>Modern Women of America Cookbook</i> [Modern Woodman Press:Rock
Island] lists no less than 23 recipes! Some are simple, others are complicated. Sour milk and
brown sugar seem to be the standard ingredients, though some recipes specified white sugar and 
sweet milk cut with boiling water. Melted/grated unsweetened chocolate (cake, bakers) was the
norm, though some recipes used cocoa. Some cakes were layered, others were baked in simple
loaf pans. About half of the early devils cakes were iced.
<p>
Recipes for devil's food cake have changed over the years. <i>Duncan Hines Dessert Book</i>
[New York:1955] lists three recipes for Devil's Food Cake, and one each for Cocoa Devil's Food
Cake, Party Devil's Food Cake, and Sour Cream Devil's Food Cake (p. 37-41). Jean Anderson's
<i>American Century Cookbook</i> (p. 452-3) does a good job outlining the evolution of this
particular cake.
<p>
<a name="reddevil">
<b>Red Devil's Food</b><br>
What makes this cake red? Harold McGee's <i>On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen</i> tells us this 
chemical reaction occurs when combining alkaline (baking soda/powder) with acid (cocoa, buttermilk, vinegar). 
"Chemical leavenings have...effects on both flavor and color...Colors are...affected conditions: browning reactions are enhanced,
 chocolate turns reddish, and blueberries turn green." (p. 534). <a href="foodcakes.html#redvelvet">Red cakes</a> can be achieved
several ways.

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Apple sauce cakes</b></font><br>
Culinary evidence places apple sauce cake (cookies, muffins, breads) in the twentieth century. Why? They are
cakes of convenience rather than tradition. Presumably, applesauce cake is a direct
descendant of light (baking soda) 19th century spiced fruit cakes made with fresh or dried apples.
These cakes, in turn, descended from traditional Medieval European fruitcake recipes. 
<a href="foodfaq.html#applesauce">Apple sauce</a> dates to the Middle Ages. <a href="foodcakes.html#aboutcake">Cake</a> is ancient. Where & when did these two
collide? Modern times. World War I era apple sauce cakes were promoted as patriotic (less butter, sugar, eggs). 
Primary evidence confims this recipe's economy. A leftover cookbook circa 1911 gives the home cook permission
to use chicken or rendered beef fat in lieu of butter. These early recipes employed applesauce for flavor and texture. 
<a href="foodcakes.html#applesaucecookies">Apple sauce cookies</a> happened during WWII. A logical convenient iteration of grandma's cake.
<p>
Post-war homemakers viewed applesauce cakes as reminders of hard times and grandma's kitchen. They moved on. Family cook book
pages, splattered with ingredients, stuck together. Recipes closed? Not exactly.
In the late 20th century, applesauce cakes 
were repurposed as healthy (less cholesterol, low-fat) alternatives to traditional cakes.
Like an old friend, apple sauce cake tolerates new ideas and quirky innovations.
Oatmeal, dried fruits, nuts, refined sugar substitutes and chocolate (cocoa, chips) are common variations celebrating a central theme.
<p>
"Nineteenth-century cookbooks brim with fruitcakes. There's the occasional apple cake, too,
usually made with dried apples but sometimes with chopped fresh apples...In my
battered copy of <i>Larkin Housewives' Cook Book</i> (1915), there are two applesauce cakes: Apple
Sauce Birthday Cake, which is loaded with chopped citron, candied lemon, and orange rind as
well as applesauce, and Eggless Apple Sauce Cake, which contains cocoa in addition to
cinnamon and cloves. During World War I, applesauce cakes became the patriotic way to cut
down on eggs, sugar, and butter...Applesauce cakes grew in popularity throughout the '20s and
 '30s, took something of a hiatus, then returned full force in the  60s. In the health-conscious
1990s, Mott's discovered that applesauce could be substituted for shortening in certain sturdy
butter cakes without mishap, gave "applesauce cake" whole new meaning...the applesauce cake
most of us know and love is the spicy loaf strewn with raisins and nuts--no stinting on shortening,
eggs, or sugar."<br>

<a name="baba">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Baba</b></font><br>
Baba (aka babka) is not one recipe, but several. According to the food historians baba doughs
range from simple yeast-based mixtures to complicated alcohol-drenched pastry. The origin of
this item  (while sketchy) is generally attributed to Slavic peoples. Plenty of legends surround
the introduction/invention of "Baba au Rhum." Not so for basic baba. Notes here:
<p>
"Babas, cakes, and pastries were adopted by the Russians only in the eighteenth century,
although yeast had been used in Russia since ancient times. German and Polish influences are
particularly strong in this type of baking. It is perhaps not surprising that Americans are
unfamiliar with the variety of babas and kuliches that were well known to Molokhovets [Russian
cookbook author, 1861]--Russian cookbooks for Americans rarely contain more than a single
recipe for each kind of yeast cake. But Russian cooks also are in danger of losing this aspect of
their culianry heritage, which now appears mostly in specialized books on baking. In part, the
nomenclature has changed (pirogi has broadened in meaning), but mostly altered tastes and
circumstances have diminished the interest in baking."<br>
---<i>Classic Russian Cooking: Elena Molokhovets' A Gift to Young Housewives</i>, translated and
introduced by Joyce Toomre [Indiana University Press:Bloomington] 1992 (p. 398)<br>
[NOTE: This book contains several recipes for mid-19th century babas. Your librarian can help
you obtain a copy.]
<p>
"Baba. A sweetened bread or cake made from a rich dough, baked in tall, cylindrical moulds. The
shape
is Slavic in origin, and of great antiquity. The 12th-century Danish chronicler Saxo Grammaticus
describes
a Baltic pagan harvest-festival bread as a 'cake, prepared with mead, round in form and standing
nearly
as high as a person'. The word means 'old woman' or 'grandmother' and refers to the vertical
form, and
anthopomorphic usage similar to the derivation of pretzel and bracelli, because the twist of
dough
resembles folded arms...If the shape is Slavic in origin, the same may not be true of the actual
recipe--it
has been suggested by Lesley Chamberlain...that this came from Italy: "The recipe for it probably
came to
Poland from Italy in the sixteenth century via Queen Bona, as a transplant of the Milanese
panettone.
Since then much ritual has surrounded the baking of this fragile masterpiece. Precious
pastrycooks
declared it needed to rest on an eiderdown before it went in the oven, after which baking took
place in an
atmosphere of maternity. Men were forbidden to center the kitchen and no one was allowed to
speak
above a whisper."...there are rival claims from the Ukraine. Savella Stechishin...says that baba or
babka is
one of the most distinctive of all Ukranian breads, traditionally served at Easter. The name 'baba'
is the
colloquial Ukranian word for woman or grandma, while 'babka' is a diminutive of the same word.
(The
name 'babka' is more commonly used, as the modern loaves are smaller and the name sounds
dantier.)...Stechishin speculates that the baba-bread may have originated in prehistoric times
when a
matriarchal system existed in the Ukraine...the baba's homeland is generally regarded as being W.
Russia
and Poland. It is related to other Russian festive breads of cakes, such as Easter kulich...or the
krendal
which is baked in a figure-of-eight shape to celebrate name days. They, however, are fortified
with dried
fruits and nuts, while the baba was originaly plain. Polish and Ukranian recipes commonly
include other
flavors (from ingredients such as saffron, almond, cheese, raisins).  Other additions, noticeable in
the
Baba au rhum and other versions which are now part of the international repertoire, consist in
adding
dried fruits and...soaking the cake in an alcoholic syrup...after it has been made. These changes
seem to
have been made in France after the baba emigrated westwards to Alsace and Lorraine. This had
happened in 1767 (when the term first appears as a French word) and the baba eventaully became
a
well-known French confection...To make a baba, yeast is mixed to a liquid batter with flour,
eggs, and
milk; this is allowed to rise, and then melted butter is beaten in. As for other yeast-risen cakes,
much
beating is necessary to impart air to the mixture. More eggs are used than in a brioche
dough...and the
recipe delays the addition of butter until after the first rise to enable the yeast to work to its full
effect."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 46-7)
<p>
"A baba is an open-textured, yeast-leavened cake, sometimes including raisins, and moistened
with rum
and sugar syrup. The first reference to it in English is by L.E. Ude, in <i>French Cook</i> (1828). Its
origins,
which are Polish, have been richly embroidered. It is said to have been invented by King
Stanislas
Leczinski, whose favorite reading was the <i>Thousand and One Nights</i>, and who consequently 
named his
creation after the character Ali Baba. Less apocryphal, perhaps, is the story that it was introduced
into
Western Europe at the beginning of the nineteenth century by the Parisian pastrycook Sthorer,
who
encountered it amongst members of the Polish court then visiting France. However that may be,
the word
itself represents Polish baba, literally 'old woman'..."<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 14)
<p>
"Baba au Rhum (Romovaya baba). Although the romovaya baba has been adopted into the classical French cuisine, its roots are
Slavic, as it was created at the court of the deposed Polish king Stanislaw Leszczynski. The word baba is a pejorative term 
for "old lady" (the original shape of the cake was said to resemble an old woman in skirts), but the dessert's whimsical moniker
belies its true elegance."<br>
---<i>A Taste of Russia: Traditional Recipes from Russia</i>, Darra Goldstein [Robert Hale:London] 1985 (p. 93)
<blockquote>
<b>[1828] Ude's recipe<br>
"Baba.</b><br>
Dilute this paste the same as the brioche. Take eight grains of saffron, which infuse in a little
water, and
then pour out this water into the paste; add two glasses of Madeira, some currants, raisins, and a
little
sugar; then make the cakes as you do the brioches. You must butter the mould when you put
them in; the
oven must be moderately hot, as the babas must remain a long time in; after one hour you must
look at
them, and preserve the colour by putting some paper over them."<br>

<b>What is the relationship between <a href="foodcakes.html#baba">baba</a> and savarin?</b>
<br>
"Savarin...is essentially an enriched yeast dough baked in a ring mould. A syrup with kirsch or rum is used to
soak it whe cool, and the central hole may be filled with fruit or cream. There is also a solid, holeless form,
mazarin, which is split and filled with cream. The savarin derived from the E. European baba, as naturalized
in Alsace in the 18th century. What happened was that in the mid-or late 1840s one of the brothers Julien,
Parisian patissiers, experimented with the baba in a slightly different form. He used the same dough, but
removed the dried fruits and soaked the savarin in his own  'secret' syrup. He named his new confection in
honour of the famous gastronomic writer Brillat-Savarin, although the name for it does not seem to have been
recorded until the 1860s."<br>

eighth of a pint additional milk, and three more eggs. Lastly, add two ounces of candied peel cut small. The
additions should be made very gradually, the eggs being put in one at a time, and the preparation being
beaten well until it leaves the sides of the bowl easily. Butter the inside of a fluted mould rather thickly, and
sprinkle a table-spoonful of blanched and chopped almonds on the butter. Beat the paste up again, and half
fill the mould with it; let it stand in a warm place till it has risen level with the top of the mould. Tie a broad band
of buttered paper round the top of the mould, to keep the paste from running over the sides, and bake the
cake in a moderate oven. When done enough, turn it out carefully, run a skewer into several parts of it, and

<a name="banana">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Banana bread</b></font><br>
<a href="fruit.html#bananas">Bananas</a> have been around since the beginning of time. 
Sweet nut breads and cakes were eaten by the ancient Roman and Greeks. Who decided to
combine these two foods? According to the food historians banana bread, as we know it today, is a relatively is a recent
USA phenomenon. 
<p>
American banana recipes date to the late 19th century. These generally included salads, pies, fritters, and gelatin combinations. Recipes proliferate
in the 20th century, a direct result of product availability. The earliest recipe we find titled "Banana bread" is dated 1849. It describes a product of West Indian
culinary tradition. Early 20th century "banana cakes" were composed with sliced
banana as either decoration or filling.
<p>
Banana recipes began showing up in popular American Cookbooks in the 1880s. It is apparent
that trendy Americans cooks were eager to include this new fruit in their meals. Most of the
banana concoctions were simple adaptions of existing recipes. <i>Mrs. Rorer's New Cook
Book</i>,
Sarah Tyson Rorer [1902] contains instructions for fried bananas, baked bananas, sliced bananas,
banana pudding and banana cake in a special section titled "Hawaiian Recipes." Other cookbooks
contain recipes for banana ice cream, bananas
en surprise (mashed bananas with strawberries), fruit salads with bananas and, of course, Jell-O
molds with bananas inside. The banana split was invented in 1904.
<p>
Banana nut bread eventually became a mainstream staple item [ie included in many popular
American cookbooks] by the 1920s. This coincided somewhat with the mass marketing of baking
powder/soda, ingredients used to create "quick breads" [breads that did not require yeast]. Food
companies deluged American consumers recipes to promote the use of their flour and baking soda products.
Eventually these companies manufactured boxed mixes [<a href="foodcakes.html#aboutcakemixes">Baking mixes</a> were introduced in the 
late 1940s] for banana nut bread/muffins. 
<p>
Modern banana bread recipes, featuring mashed bananas, first surfaced in the 1930s. They assumed traditional forms (layer cakes, muffins,
loaves) and were classified as quick bread, tea cake, or dessert. Some food historians theorize this recipe was "invented"
by thrifty housewives who didn't want to throw out over-ripe bananas. Our evidence suggests the recipe was probably developed
in corporate kitchens to promote the star ingredient. In the 1950s banana bread was actively promoted in nationally syndicated 
television cooking shows. 1960s health food activist Carlton Fredericks included <a href="foodcakes.html#bananbran"">banana-bran muffins</a> in his ground-breaking cookbook.
one full decade later this quick bread was actively promoted to the American public as health food. Think: 
<a href="foodcakes.html#carrotcake">Carrot cake</a> and <a href="foodfaq2.html#zucchinibread">Zucchini bread</a>. 
<br>
<blockquote>
<b>[1849]<br>
Banana Bread</b>--is made of the fruit of the banana tree. This fruit is about four or five inches long, of the shape of a cucumber, and of a highly grateful 
flavour. They grow in bunches that weigh twelve pounds and upwards. The pulp of the banana tree is softer than that of the plantain tree, and of a more luscious
 taste. When ripe it is a very pleasant food, either undressed, or fried in slices like fritters. All classes of people in the West Indies are very fond of it. When 
preparing for a voyage, they take the ripe fruit and squeeze it through a sieve; then form the mass into loaves, which are dried in the sun, or baked on hot ashes, 
having been previously wrapped up in leaves."<br>

A few weeks ago we published our notes on <a href="foodcakes.html#reddevil">Red Devils Food Cake</a> (what makes it red) and a reader responded "the 
beets!" 
Our survey of recipes published in historic newspapers and cookbooks confirms WWII-era cake recipes sometimes substituted beet sugar for 
rationed white granules. The earliest print recipe we find combining beets and chocolate cake is from 1965. We find no evidence in our Russian/Ukrainian/Central European cookbooks supporting this recipe originated in those cuisines. It seems to be a purely American invention. Print evidence suggests it originated in the Midwest area, in the heart of beet growing region. Makes perfect sense, yes?

"Unknown to me, although I try to keep up with cooking trends, chocolate cake recipes calling for beets--yes, beets--have been making the 
rounds. My first encounter with such a recipe was about a month ago in a book just off the press,'<i>Farm Journal's Choice Chocolate Recipes</i>,' 
Edited by <i>Farm Journal's</i> Food Editor, Elise Manning, and published by Doubleday. A few weeks later I came across a chocolate beet cake recipe 
again, this time a prize-winner in a collection of favorite recipes submitted by newspaper readers. Curious about the origin of the idea, I phoned 
my friend Elise in Philadelphia to ask her what she know about it. Her's what she told me: 'In 1978 we ran a request in <i>Farm Journal</i> for our readers' 
favorite chocolate recipes. The response for such a special subject was great--between 18,000 and 20,000 entries. In the cake category, at
 least 15 of the recipes were for chocolate beet cakes. When I tested the best recipes for our chocolate book, I found a Red Beet Chocolate Cake
 form a Missouri woman deserved to be included.' The idea of a cake with beets in it sounded like fun to me, a mystery cake to serve to friends 
and ask them to guess its secret ingredient. So I worked out a version without chocolate--a beet spice cake. <p>

"The name of this recipe should be "quizzical cake ." That's the look most people give after finding out that the main ingredient in Vicky Schmitz's chocolate cake is pureed beets . Beets lend moisture and sweetness to Schmitz's dense chocolate cake with hints of cinnamon and clove. Schmitz first baked the cake nine years ago for her birthday. "The recipe sounded so unusual, but it's the best thing I've ever baked, and it's foolproof," she said. 
Schmitz, a volunteer for Habitat for Humanity (a nonprofit group that builds and renovates low-income housing), recently served her spiced chocolate - beet cake dripping with bittersweet chocolate sauce to a volunteer construction crew on the West Side. Most of the volunteers were surprised to learn about the cake 's secret ingredient. And Schmitz went home with an empty plate. 
Irene Bogdan also likes to see the surprised expressions on her guests' faces when she serves her chocolate - beet cake . "I usually wait until someone asks for seconds before I tell them they are eating beets ," Bogdan said. 
Published in <i>Who's Cooking What in Illinois</i> (1978), Bogdan's recipe calls for fresh beets , but canned can be substituted when fresh aren't available. E.B., who requested a recipe for chocolate cake made with beets , should be pleased with either version....

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Birthday cake</b></font><br>
Cakes were eaten to celebrate birthdays long before they were called "birthday cakes." Food
historians confirm ancient bakers made cakes (and specially shaped breads) to mark births,
weddings, funerals, harvest celebrations, religious observances, and other significant events.
Recipes varied according to era, culture, and cuisine. Cakes were usually saved for special
occasions because they were made with finest, most expensive ingredients available to the cook.
The wealthier one was, the more likely one might consume cake on a more frequent basis. 
<p>
The birthday cakes we enjoy today are inventions of the 19th century. These were enjoyed by
middle and upper classes.  People with less money and poorly stocked larders also made birthday
cakes. Their were not quite the light, fluffy iced concoctions served by their wealthier
contemporaries. In all places and times, cooks blessed with creativity and "make do" spirit
generated some pretty fine foods in the name of love. This was also true in War time.
<p>
The practice of eating cake on a regular basis by "average people" became possible in the 19th
century. Why? The Industrial Revolution made many baking ingredients more affordable
(mass-production) and readily available (railroads). It also introduced modern leavening agents,
(baking
soda, baking powder), a variety of cheaper substitutions (corn syrup for sugar; margarine for
butter), and more reliable ovens.
<p>
Cake history expert Simon R. Charlsey makes this
observation:<blockquote>

"Birthday cakes might still in the nineteenth century be of the same kind [as wedding cakes], but
as their use spread, their composition became typically simpler. For preference of the child or
other person celebrating, or of the cook, or whatever the confectioner had used for a decorated
shop cake."<br>
---<i>Wedding Cakes and Cultural History</i>, Simon R. Charsley [Routledge:London] 1992
(p. 61)

"The dominant English culture in America shaped birthday patterns for some time. Colonial birthdays were enjoyed by
privileged adults, who feasted well, or at the very least, shared a glass of wine and a small slice of fruitcake with friends.
Children's parties echoed the adult formats...In the new age of democracy, birthdays did not remain class-limited. As the
nineteenth century progressed, a number of factors reshaped the events. The growth of industry, elevated urban material
standards, and emering middle class culture amde more elaborate birthday celebrations increasingly attractive. Changing notions
of the nature of childhood stimulated a new style of young people's parties...Ice cream and cake became defining elements, whether
after a meal or as the centerpiece of a party...Although fruitcakes and rich, yeasted cakes were the traditional English festive cakes, the
modern form of birthday cake originated in American kitchens in the mid-nineteenth century. In
contrast to their European counterparts, American women were active home bakers, largely
because of the abundance of oven fuel in the New World and the sparsity of professional bakers.
By the late 1800s, home bakers were spurred further by several innovations. The cast-iron kitchen
stove, complete with its own quickly heated oven, became standard equipment in urban
middle-class homes. Women in towns had more discretionary time, compared to farm-women, and
they
had an expanding social life that required formal and informal hospitality. Sugar, butter, spice, and
flour costs were dropping. Improved chemical leavening agents, baking powder among them,
enabled simpler and faster baking and produced a cake of entirely different flavor and texture. A
cake constructed in layers, filled and frosted, became the image of the standard birthday cake. One
observer of the early 1900s compared bubbly soap lather to "the fluffiness of a birthday cake" and
snowy, frost covered hills to iced birthday cakes...Writing on birthday cakes began with
professional bakers and caterers, who were proliferating in growing cities. The cakes of the late
1800s were decorated with inscriptions like "Many Happy Returns of the Day" and the
celebrant's name, a tradition that continues into the twenty-first century. Sometimes the cake was
home-baked but then decorated by a specialist...The phrase "Happy Birthday" did not appear on
birthday cake messages until the popularization of the now-ubiquitous song "Happy Birthday to
You" (1910). Cookbook authors began to recommend decorating with birth dates and names and
offered instruction on how to make colored frostings...By 1958, A.H. Vogel had begun to
manufacture preformed cake decorations. Inexpensive letters, numbers, and pictorial images, such
as flowers or bow, with matching candleholders were standard supermarket offerings."<br>
---<i>Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America</i>, Andrew F. Smith editor [Oxford
University Press:New York] 2004, Volume 1 (p. 99-100)<br>
<p>
"Small, colored candles became an integral part of the American birthday cake. An American style guide of 1889 directed, "At
birthday parties, the birthday cake, with as many tiny colored candles set about its edge as the child is years old, is, of
course, of special importance." The modern use of candles on a special cake may be connected to the German tradition of Kinderfest,
dating from the fifteenth century, a time when people believed that on birthdays children were particularly susceptible to
evil spirits. Friends and family gathered around protectively, keeping the cake's candles lit all day until after the evening
meal, when the cake was served. The candles were thought to carry one's wished up to God. This German observance was brought
to colonial Pennsylvania and was later reinforced by the influence of British-German fashions from Queen Victoria's court."<br>

American cookbooks bear this out. In the last quarter of the 19th century, we find a veritable
explosion of simple cake recipes. <i>Mrs. Porter's New Southern Cookery Book</i> [1871]
contains several of these items. Many have inventive names. Curiously? None of them are called
"birthday cake." The recipes provided by Mrs. Porter that are most like today's birthday cakes
are: "Silver cake," "Gold cake," and "Little Folks' Joys."

milk, two cups flour, one teaspoon baking powder, one-half teaspoonful of vanilla. Beat together
the butter and sugar, add the eggs, then the flour, baking-powder and nutmeg sifted together.
Place in small well-greased tins and just before putting into the oven drop a few seeded raisins on
top of each cake. Spread on the top a few drops of boiled icing and on top of these some colored
candies or cinnamon drops, as they are favorites with the little folks. Aunt Mary."<br>

Fannie Merritt Farmer's <i>Catering for Special Occasions</i>
devotes an entire chapter to "Birthday feasting." Adult menus do not include cake. Child menus
do. Ms. Farmer suggests children's parties include Angel Birthday Cake and Sunshine Birthday
Cake. Both are simple, iced angel cakes. The difference? Sunshine cake is a little richer. This
recipe includes yolks and almond extract. Recipes here:<br>
<blockquote>
<b>Angel cake</b><br>
Whites 5 eggs<br>
3/4 cup sugar<br>
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar<br>
1/2 cup bread flour<br>
1 teaspoon vanilla<p>
Beat whites of eggs until stiff and dry and add gradually, while beating constantly, sugar (fine
granulated) mixed and sifted with cream of tartar. Sift flour into mixture, add vanilla, and cut and
fold until blended. Turn into a buttered and floured angel-cake pan and bake in a moderate oven.
Remove from pan, cover with White Mountain Frosting, and ornament with small candles placed
in flower cases. The little cases may be bought of first-class city grocers or dealers in
confectioners' supplies."<br>

[NOTE: Ms. Farmer's the candle decoration notes suggest this practice was primarily enjoyed by
wealthy people in 1911. Many middle/laboring-class families and isolated farm cooks could not
afford to purchase goods from first-class city grocers or specialty suppliers.]
<p>
<b>Sunshine Birthday Cake</b><br>
Whites 5 eggs<br>
1/4 teaspoon salt<br>
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar<br>
Yolks 3 eggs<br>
3/4 cup sugar<br>
1/2 teaspoon almond extract<br>
1/2 cup pastry flour<p>
Add salt to whites of eggs and beat until light. Sift in cream of tartar and beat until stiff. Beat
yolks of eggs until thick and lemon colored and add two heaping beaten whites. To remaining
whites add gradually sugar measured after five siftings. Add almond extract and combine
mixtures. Cut and fold in flour measured after five siftings. Bake in angel-cake pan, first dipped in
cold water, in a slow oven one hour. Have a pan of hot water in oven during the baking, Remove
from pan, frost and decorate, same as Angel Birthday Cake."<br>

<b>White Mountain Frosting</b><br>
1 cup sugar<br>
1/3 cup boiling water<br>
1 teaspoon vanilla or 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice<br>
Whites 2 eggs<br>
Put sugar and water in saucepan, and stir to prevent sugar from adhering to saucepan; heat
gradually to boiling-point, and boil without stirring until syrup will thread when dripped from tip
of spoon or tines of silver fork. Pour syrup gradually on beaten white of egg, beating mixture
constantly, and continue beating until of right consistency to spread; then add flavoring and pour
over cake, spreading evenly with back of spoon. Crease as soon as firm. If not beaten long
enough, frosting will run; if beaten too long, it will not be smooth. Frosting beaten too long may
be improved by adding a few drops of lemon juice or boiling water. This frosting is soft inside and
has a glossy surface."<br>

<b>Contrast the above recipes with this pioneer-era birthday cake [Texas
1851]</b><br><blockquote>
"<b>Pioneer Birthday Cake</b><br>
This recipe was used to make a birthday cake for a small girl eighty-five years ago. There was no
flour to be had, and corn was ground on a handmill. The meal was carefully emptied from one
sack to another, and fine meal dust clinging to the sack was carefully shaken out on paper; the
sack was again emptied and shaken, and the process was repeated labouriously time after time
until two cupsful of meal dust was obtained. The rest of the ingredients were as follows: 1/2 cup
of wild honey, 1 wild turkey egg, 1 teaspoonful of homemade soda, 1 scant cupful of sour milk
and a very small amount of butter, to all of which was added the meal dust. The batter was
poured into a skillet with a lid, and placed over the open fire in the yard, the skillet lid being
heaped with coals. To a little girl's childish taste the cake was very fine, but looking back through
the years, the nonoree said relfectively, "It was none too sweet."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Pound cake</b></font><br>
Food historians generally agree that pound cake is a Northern European recipe named for the
equal weight of its ingredients. Recipes printed in contemporary American cookbooks follow the
same general proportions. The "pound" connection is not obvious today because we now measure
with cups, not weight. American cookbooks printed in the early decades of the 20th century
helped cooks bridge the gap by including both sets of measurements.
<p>
Historic evidence confirms recipes for pound cake first surface in 18th century English and
American cookbooks. Then, as now, there were variations on the recipe. Early recipes sometimes
included alcohol and currants.  Many are flavored with a hint lemon. Then, as now, proportions
varied. Many recipes for pound cake call for more or less than a pound! <a

simple cake to make to this day."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Pumpkin bread</b></font><br>
 Pumpkin bread (pumpkin cake, pumpkin cookies, etc.), as we Americans know it today, descends from a long line of 
classically spiced baked goods incorporating vegetables/fruits & spices. Obviously, the same basic culinary evolution as 
<a href="foodcakes.html#carrotcake">carrot cake</a>, <a href="foodcakes.html#banana">banana bread</a> &
 <a href="foodfaq2.html#zucchinibread">zucchini bread</a>. Or is it?
<p>
Food historians confirm squash (pumpkins &c.) perched patiently in the pantry of "New World" foods easily incorporated into "Old World" 
recipes. Cultural culinary synergy was inevitable. Pumpkin recipes are classic examples. Think: <a href="foodpies.html#pumpkin">
Pumpkin pie</a>.  On closer examination? Pumpkin bread is not one but several recipes depending upon place, people & period.
This particular dish sets a unique table spread with rudimentary cakes, thickened porridge,
savory pone, potato-type yeast breads, European inspired spice cake & quick (chemically leavened) loaves composed
 with canned product. In sum: the perfect study of culinary evolution.

 To make pumpkin bread, it is necessary to parboil the pumpkin as you would to fricassee
 and pass it through a heavy towel to take out the little nerves which are therein, adding the
 water in which the pumpkin was cooked as much as is necessary to knead in the ordinary
 way--and governing your dough for two raisings, and thus, as I say, before you will make a
 good bread which will be a little fat when cooked and yellow which is excellent for those
 who have need of refreshment and to have a free stomach."

<a href="foodfaq1.html#cranberries">Cranberry cookery</a> in America predates European settlement. Most of the cranberry recipes we
enjoy today, descend from European culinary traditions. People cook what they know. Cranberry bread is a 20th century twist on the
enriched fruited bread theme.
<p>
James Beard prefaced his recipe for "Quick Cranberry Bread" thusly: "This is an unusally good version of an old American favorite..." (<i>Beard on Bread</i>, 
Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1975, p. 176). On the following page he lists variations, including "Cranberry Orange Bread," adding 1/2 cup orange juice and 3 
tablespoons grated orange rind to the mixture. His words make us wonder...exactly how old is this recipe? When and why were oranges added? 
<p>
American cranberry production is concentrated in East Massachusetts, South New Jersey and North Wisconsin. Orange/citrus production is California/Florida 
based. None of our 19th century American cookbooks contain for cranberry breads (quick or yeast). Pre-20th century cranberry recipes concentrate on sauce 
(mostly boiled), conserves, jellies, puddings, and pie fillings. Citrus fruit infiltrates cranberry recipes slowly, but surely, in the dawning 20th century decades. No
 reason is profferd in primary documents. Perhaps it was a perfect storm of industry collusion and contemporary taste. 
<p>
Jean Anderson's <i>American Century Cookbook</i> [1997] states "This quick-and-easy [Cranberry-Nut] bread has been popular from the mid-twentieth 
century on. With only 1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) shortening, with orange juice the liquid ingredient instead of milk, it is also lower in fat than many fruit-nut breads." 
(p. 328). Our survey of historic American cook books and newspapers confirms the existance of cranberrry baked goods (muffins, breads, etc.) from 1903 
forward. Oranges (juice/diced sections/grated rind) were included in selected recipes from the late 1930s forward.
<p>
<b>Corporate connections</b><br>
Both Ocean Spray [cranberries] and Sunkist [oranges & lemons] actively promoted their crops to American cooks. An undated [probably 1910s-1920s] Ocean Spray advertising booklet  promoting canned cranberry sauce shows a picture of cranberry muffins. Annotation reads "Cut our sauce into small cubes and mix in your favorite batter. Delicious in Bran or dark muffins." A 1941 booklet ["Cape Cod's Famous Cranberry Recipes] contains two muffin recipes, both featuring their canned jellied product; neither with orange. Their Cranberry-Orange Relish recipe is subtitled without comment: "The National Favorite." 
Sunkist Recipes: Oranges-Lemons [c. 1916] offers recipes for yeast-based Orange Bread and Orange Peel Bread. No reference to cranberries anywhere. What makes this booklet notable is the complier, Alice Bradley, principal of Miss Farmer's School of Cookery. Sunkist was actively promoting their citrus fruits as healthy foods, easily included in traditional recipes. We have to believe Boston-based Miss Bradley was familiar with cranberries. The 1896 edition of the Boston Cooking School Cook Book does not combine cranberries and oranges. The 1923 edition (p. 710) offers a recipe for Cranberry Conserve using 1 orange (cut into small pieces, no rind), English walnut meats and seeded raisins. The Bradley factor?
Our survey of historic cookbooks confirm the cranberry-orange-nut combinations grew in popularity. The <i>New Butterick Cook Book</i> [c. 1924] adds 1 cup 
of orange juice to its Cranberry Conserve recipe (p. 702). An alternate version uses rind and juice of 2 oranges and 2 lemons, no nutmeats. Suzanne Cary Gruver's
<i> Cape Cod Cook Book</i> [c. 1930] contains a chapter on cranberry cookery. for this purpose is her recipe for Cranberry Conserve--"Jelly Kitchen" similar
 to the ones reference above.  We find similar recipes (titled conserves or relish) in the <i>Good Housekeeping Cook Book</i> [c. 1933] and other popular culinary 
texts.
<p>
<b>Cranberry bread & muffins</b><br>
The earliest reference we find for cranberry baked goods [muffins] was published in the <i>Mansfield News</i> [OH], January 28, 1903 (p. 5). It was listed as a 
menu selection; no recipe provided. The oldest cranberry muffin recipe we have on file is from 1911.  The earliest bread recipe we find combining cranberries and 
oranges [grated rinds] was published in a Massachusetts newspaper, 1938. Orange juice enters in the 1950s.

Individually portioned confections have a long and venerable history. Diminutive iterations
of popular traditional baked goods are particularly enjoyed when portability and ease of service is
appreciated. Cookies, tea cakes, petits fours and cupcakes all spring from the basic same idea.
Commerically packaged "personal size" cupcakes appeared after World War I. Think:

<p>
There seem to be two theories about the origin of recipes titled "cupcake:"<p>

1. The name comes from the amount of ingredients used to make the cake (a cupful of flour, a
cupful of butter, cupful of sugar etc.). <br>
---This is very similar to how  pound cake  was named. In fact, the recipes for cup cakes and
pound cakes include pretty much the same ingredients and would have produced similar
results.<p>
2. These cakes were originally baked in cups.<br>
---Old cookbooks also sometimes mention baking cakes in small cups. These cups may very well
have been earthenware tea cups or other small clay baking pans. These would easily accomodated
baking level oven heat and produce individual-sized cakes. This is not the same thing as
contemporary metal cupcake pans, enabling cooks to bake a dozen small cakes in one fell culinary
swoop. 
<p>
Which is true? Both! We have historical evidence (old cookbooks) that support both theories.
This food historian agrees:
<p>
"Cupcake<br>
The name given in Britain and generally in the USA to any small cake baked in a cup-shaped
mould or in a paper baking cup. In the USA the term may have originally have been related to the
American measuring system, based upon the cup."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson (p. 234)
<p>
Small pound cakes baked in individual-portion pans were quite popular in the 18th century.
"Queen Cakes" are a good example of these. Food historians tell us this recipe evolved from
lighter fruitcakes
baked in England.
<p>
"Queen cake. A small rich cake made from a creamed mixture with currants, lemon zest, and
sometimes chopped
almonds, baked as individual cakes. They have been popular since at least the 18th century. Now
usually baked in paper
cases, traditionally little fluted moulds in fancy shapes were used; Eliza Acton (1845) said that
heart-shaped moulds
were usual for this mixture."<br>

<p>
20th century cupcake variations are endless. They range from simple to sublime. Baking papers
come in designer prints. Individual portions and easy clean-up make cupcakes perennial favorites
for classroom birthdays and bake sales. A survey of American cookbooks reveals the interest in
cupcakes, as food in their own right, has grown over the years.

<b>Cupcakes in a "nutshell," courtesy of <i>Scientific American</i>, September 2009 (p. 98):</b><p>
"The yummy baked good is one of America's first and finest contributions to world cuisine 
Like many acts of pure genius, the invention of the cupcake is lost in the creamy fillings of history. According to food historian Andrew Smith, the first known recipe
 using the term "cupcake" appeared in an American cookbook in 1826. The "cup" referred not to the shape of the cake but to the quantity of ingredients; it was 
simply a downsized English pound cake. Lynne Olver, who maintains a Web site called the Food Timeline, has tracked down a recipe for cakes baked in cups from 
1796. But we will probably never know the name of the first cook to take the innovative leap or whether it had anything to do with a six-year-old's birthday party. 
"Just like other popular foods--the brownie comes to mind--it's impossible to pinpoint a date of origin for the cupcake," says culinary historian Andrea Broomfield.
That cook almost certainly lived on the left bank of the Atlantic. Broomfield says that the earliest known cupcake recipes in England date to the 1850s and that their
 popularization was slow. One writer in 1894 had evidently never heard of cupcakes: "In Miss [Mary E.] Wilkins's delightful New England Stories, and in other
 tales relating to this corner of the United States, I have frequently found mention of cup-cake, a dainty unknown, I think, in this country. Will some friendly reader  on the other side of the Atlantic kindly answer this query, and initiate an English lover of New England folks and ways into the mysteries of cup-cake?" Even to this day true cupcakes--as opposed to muffins or cakes cut up into cup-size portions--are sadly uncommon in Europe.
In recent years the U.S. has had something of a great cupcake awakening, as blogs and bakeries have devoted themselves to its pleasures. Some attribute this
 renewed popularity to the cupcake-indulging characters of HBO's Sex and the City, and food historian Susan Purdy also credits dietary awareness: you can have 
your low-calorie cake and eat it, too. But true connoisseurs needed no moment of rediscovery. They never forgot what it was like to be six." By George Musser"

  "In 1919, World War I ended, prohibition was about to begin and women were ready to vote.
  It was also the year that Hostess introduced its first snack cake -- the cupcake. The Hostess
  Cupcake, which celebrates it 70th birthday Wednesday, has come a long way since its
  inception. It always has been made of devil's food cake, but the first cupcake lacked the
  creme filling and the white loop-de-loop icing on top.  During the 1920s, cupcakes were
  hand-iced in either chocolate or vanilla. For a while in the 1940s, they were available with
  malted milk icing. Orange cupcakes with orange icing, which are still available, also were
  introduced in the 1940s. But it wasn't until 1947 that the cupcakes began to develop into the
  cupcake of today after D.R. ''Doc'' Rice was given the task of redesigning it.
  Rice was hired by the company in September 1923 at the age of 17 as a cake dumper. A cake
  dumper did just that -- dumped baked cakes onto a table, he said.
  ''I wanted to go to business college,'' Rice said Tuesday. ''The hours at the bakery worked
  with my schedule. I usually started around midnight and worked for nine hours, six days a
  week.'' By the time he enlisted in the Army, Rice had been regional supervisor of five
  bakeries. When he returned after the war, he went to work in the production department of
  Continental Baking Co. at its headquarters in New York. ''I began working in the
  experimental bakery,'' Rice said. ''More ingredients were available, and the dough was
  improved. The icing was also improved by using pure chocolate to make it. ''Just when we
  were ready to go to the plants with the cupcake, a machine which would automatically put
  the creme filling into Twinkies, which had been introduced in 1930, was perfected,'' he said.
  Before a machine was designed, the filling was pumped into the Twinkies by hand. ''We
  weren't sure we were going to fill cupcakes. But since the machine was ready, the cupcakes
  were also filled,'' he said. The new cupcakes had an improved cake mix, purer chocolate
  icing, creme filling and a straight white line of icing. They were introduced in Detroit, the
  home of the creme-filled cupcake. ''The white line was received well, but didn't do the new
  cupcakes justice,'' he said. ''It needed something that would catch the eye and let the buyer
  know it was quality.'' After a couple of weeks, the white loop-de-loop icing began appearing
  on the cupcakes. Rice noted that the perfect cupcake should have exactly seven loops.''We
  began selling 25 percent more new cupcakes than the regular ones,'' he said. ''Eventually the
  regular cupcakes were discontinued.'' Since the cupcakes were going to have creme filling,
  the prices had to be increased, Rice said. ''The wholesale price jumped from 8 cents to 10
  cents and the retail prices went from 10 cents to 12 cents.'' Although he retired in 1972, Rice
  continues to work as a consultant for many companies, even outside the country."<br>
  ---"And By The Way ...Hostess Cupcake celebrates 70th birthday," C.E. EVANS,<i>United
  Press International</i>, May 10, 1989, 
  <p>
  "The man responsible for the curlycue in Hostess cupcakes tells of a brand turnaround. Doc
  Rice didn't get his nickname because he had a Ph.D. On the contrary, he never graduated
  from college. His initials, D.R., legally make up his first name, and co-workers at the
  Continental Baking Companies nicknamed him Doc long before any of them realized Rice
  would become the "Doctor of Dessert." Rice is considered the father of modern Hostess
  Cupcakes and has been getting a lot of publicity since the popular mouthful turned 70 this
  year. At 83, Rice seems a throwback to simpler days in corporate America--days when
  companies weren't strangled by their own management layers, and when R&D was the
  function of any employee with good hunches and the necessary amount of luck. He also
  symbolizes another almost antiquated figure in this era of merger and acquisition-induced
  redundancies and cutbacks: the career employee. "Today people change jobs a lot," he says.
  "Back in my days, if you came to me looking for work and had had more than two jobs, I
  wouldn't hire you because I figured you wouldn't stay with me either. Today it's different."
  Rice's road to baking's hall of fame started in his native Texas in 1923 when, at 17, he got
  a job in CBC's Dallas bakery as a "cake dumper" putting baked cakes out on racks to cool.
  The pay was $ 15 a week. The hours were midnight to 8 or 9 a.m. "I had just gotten out of
  high school and was married. And I wanted to keep going to school," he said. However, he
  admits another reason he didn't mind the night shift was it left him time to pursue his
  passion: baseball. "I was half made up in my mind whether I should play baseball, or do
  something else," he said. Rice opted for the "something else" of CBC. He relished in a relief
  shift that opened all facets of bakery production up to him. "At midnight I relieved the mixer,
  then the oven man, then the icing maker. I learned to do all of those key jobs," he said. This
  experience soon showed dividends. In 1928 he became the youngest bakery superintendant
  ever at CBC, taking that post in Cincinnati at the age of 22. By the time he was 29, five
  plants were under his supervision. In 1939 he got a job as general manager in charge of the
  CBC's Buffalo bakery. "When I got there it was a depressed town. Our business was based
  on the steel mills and they were closed. Our one competitor left town. Then, with the war,
  the work came and Buffalo became a boomtown," Rice says. The cake route averages in
  Buffalo went from the bottom of the baking tin at CBC to the very top. In 1942, Rice took
  a hiatus from CBC by enlisting in the Army as a second lieutenant. He remained Stateside,
  appropriately enough in charge of baking at a training camp. He left the service as a captain
  and returned to CBC in 1948 as director of production for the cake division. Soon he was to
  make the major product innovation for which he is remembered. Though Hostess Cupcakes
  were on the market since 1919, they lacked their characteristic icing and filling. Rice said he
  was presented with the problem of improving the quality of Hostess Cupcakes, which
  because of World War Two-induced shortages had suffered. The company was also looking
  for a way to add value to the cakes so it could sell them at a higher price. Rice decided to put
  a modified version of the Hostess Twinkies filling into Hostess Cupcakes. Next came a white
  stripe across the top of the cupcake. "After two weeks we said, Hell, that stripe doesn't look
  good.' So we decided to do the curlycue thing," he said. The result was the signature seven
  loops that adorn every Hostess cupcake. Was seven some sort of lucky number? "I wasn't
  aware of it at the time. That's the number that fit and looked right," says Rice. The price of
  the cupcakes increased from 8 cents to 10 cents . Product flew off the shelves. Eventually the
  striped cupcakes were phased out. Rice's looped cupcakes continue to sell today. In 1988
  over 400 million Hostess Cupcakes were sold domestically. How much market research and
  consumer testing was done before the new format was approved? "We didn't go through all
  of these consumer surveys. We were just lucky. Me and my boss made up our minds on
  something and we did it," says Rice. The cupcake isn't the only CBC brand Rice had a hand
  in. In attempting to find uses for equipment that the bakeries had sitting idle, Rice and his
  cohorts developed both Twinkies and Suzy Qs.... 

Rice says Suzy Q was named after the daughter of one of his
  bosses. A Different World Although he was eventually named vice president and made head
  of new product development, Rice feels his best work was done on the line. "I had done most
  of the good things before I got the title, when I was head of production. I always thought it
  was our job to develop new products," he said. After retiring in 1972, Rice acted as a bakery
  consultant, so he is aware of how things have changed since his days at CBC. Even CBC
  itself has changed. In 1968 it was acquired by International Telephone and Telegraph Corp.
  and subsequently bought by Ralston Purina in 1984. "It's a different world," says Rice. "I'm
  glad I'm sitting where I am. Today, you don't have two people running a company, you have
  committees." As with many involved in packaged goods, Rice feels that costs of bringing a
  brand to market have strangled new-product development and paralyzed many people
  charged with coming up with ideas. "We wasted good ability because people are afraid to do
  things because they fear getting into job trouble," he says. As he approaches 84, Rice still
  plays golf and consults. Last March he made his 43rd trip to the Society of Baking Engineers
  convention so he can "keep up." He keeps busy partly on the advice of a friend. "He said,
  When you retire, don't ever wake up in the morning unless you have something to do.' Now
  that's good advice."<br>

<b>Baking cakes with paper liners and cups</b><br>
The modern practice of lining baking molds with paper first surfaces in mid-19th century cookbooks. They confirm paper (parchment, buttered, writing)
used as liners in molded metal baking pans. Recipes for cakes, small cakes (cupcakes) and souffles are msot likely to
recommend paper liners. Fluted paper cups were used to to serve candy and nuts. The term "paper cases" means different things
in different times and places. A careful examination of the description and purpose reveals whether the item is a paper box meant
to hold a cake or candy, a fancy party favor, or to be used in baking. Some cookbooks also suggest placing a piece of paper on 
top of the cake to prevent a hard crust. 
<p>
Modern decorative paper baking cups (cup cake papers) surface after WWI. These were suggested for serving, not baking. 
In the 1930s instructions for baking cup cakes baked in paper cases were promoted by popular home economists. Several US patents 
for paper baking cases of various sizes and designs were issued in this decade. We have not researched patents issued by 
other countries. <a href="food2.html#papercups">Paper drinking cups</a> were patented in they USA in the 1880s.

'sand tourte' mixture not thicker than a thin pancake. The 'sand tourte' mixture is made thus:- stir half pound of butter tto a cream, then add the yolks of 
12 eggs and half a lemon peel grated. Add by degrees half a pound of sifted sugar, quarter of a pound of fine flour, and the same of potato flour. When 
these ingredients are well mixed, add the egg whites whipped to a snow. Bake the cakes in a moderate oven to a nice yellow; do not let them tinge

why this is economical is that the cake supply for a meal can be most precisely planned. If any guest chooses to leave his portion there it is in 
better condition far, for keeping, than a slice of cake. You do not need to urge him to eat more than he needs, as you might with

<b>[1931: baking cup cakes in fluted paper cups on flat cookie sheet or muffin tins] </b><br>
"Mrs. M. B. wants us to give some advice on the baking of cake in paper cups--the fluted kind that are especially designed and prepared 
for baking cup cakes. She is unable to get the cakes out of the cups when they are baked and she wants to know if they should be 
removed from the cups while warm or after they have cooled. I've never had any difficulty with paper cups except one time when I 
was trying a new recipe which proved a failure. There was too much sugar in proportion to the other ingredients. The cakes fell during 
the baking, the texture was poor, and the crust was sugary. It was impossible to remove these cups unless the paper was picked off in tiny bits. I 
have baked all kinds of cakes, using, of course, the recipes with which I was familiar, and in each instance the cake baked 
in the cups perfectly and the cups always came out nicely from either hot or cold cakes. I prefer, however, to wait until cakes are 
cold. The shape is much better. Some precautions should be taken when baking in paper cups. Do not fill the cups more than 2/3 
full of better. In fuller cups the cake is liable to rise enough to spill over the sides. It is also important that the cups be placed 
at least two inches apart on a baking tin. Use a baking sheet that is used for cookies or biscuit to set cups on. This much space 
around each cup allows the heat to circulate freely and brown the sides. If the cups are placed on the sheets touching each other the 
cakes are sure to be out of shape. The cups may also be dropped into muffin tins, which keep the shape and brown the sides and bottom of the 
cake equally well." <br>

Black Forest Cake (gateau) descends from fancy Renaissance-era confections combining sponge cake and cream. Think: 
<a href="foodfaq1.html#englishtrifle">English Trifle</a>.  
Recipes evolve according to local ingredients and taste. Rich cake-like confections featuring sour fruit, including cherries, and chocolate are traditionally associated 
with Germany, Austria and surrounding regions. About <a href="foodcakes.html#blackforestfood">Black Forest cuisine</a>.
<p>
German national Karl Fredrich Von Rumohr mentioned combinations of chocolate cake and sour fruit in his <i>Essence of Cookery</i> [1822]:
"In many German towns, pastry and cake 'factories' have risen from the ruins of the art of true housekeeping. I have seen cakes
emerging from these places with layers of tart fruit, chocolate, vanilla, almond paste, sour preserves and insipid sweetness." (Barbara Yeomans
translation [Prospect Books:London] 1993 (p. 131). He does not provide a recipe for these items.
<p>
While the ingredients and general method of Black Forest Cake can be traced through hundreds of years, food historians generally agree this recipe belongs to the 20th century. 
We find no evidence of anything close to Black Forest Cake, as we know it today, in our small collection of 19th-20th century 
German-American cooking texts. The earliest recipes we find are dated 1960s.

"Black Forest Gateau.
Schwarzwalder Kirschtorte in German, a baroque confection of layers of chocolate cake, interspersed
with whipped cream and stoned, cooked, sweetened sour cherries. The cake layers are often sprinkled
with kirsch, and the whole is covered with whipped cream and decorated with chocolate curls. This
confection is not one which has a long history. It has been suggested that is was created in the 1930s in
Berlin, but firm evidence is elusive. What is certain is that in the last decade of the 20th century it made a
triumphant entry into the dessert course of restaurants in Britain (and no doubt elsewhere) and reigned for

1 one-pound can sour cherries<br>
1/2 cup kirschwasser<br>
1 three-ounce (85-gram) bar of imported bittersweet chocolate<br>
3 cups heavy cream<br>
3 drops pure vanilla extract<br>
Scraped and/or grated chocolate for garnish.<br>
1. Prepare the spongecake and set aside.<br>
2. Combine half a cup of sugar and the water in a saucepan. Add the orange or lemon wedges and bring to the boil. Simmer about 
three minutes and let the syrup cool. Discard wedges. <br>
3. Drain both cans of cherries separately and set cherries aside.<br>
4. Combine the kirschwasser with two-thirds cup of the syrup. Set aside.<br>
5. Place the chocolate in a saucepan and let it melt gradually in a warm place. When it is melted, gradually add three tablespoons of the
remaining syrup, stirring.<br>
6. Whip the cream and beat in the remaining tablespoon of sugar and the vanilla.<br>
7. Fold one and one-half cups of the whipped creaminto the choclate mixture. Set the remaining whipped cream aside.<br>
8. Place the cake on a flat surface and, holding a knife parallel to the bottom of the cake, slice the cake into thirds.<br>
9. Place the bottom slice on a serving plate and brush with sonmeof the syrup mixture. Add about half the chocolate mixture to 
the slice and smooth it over.<br>
10. Cover with the top slice but place it bottom side up. Brush the slice with syrup and add the remaining chocolate mixture, smoothing
it over. Using a pastry tube, pipe three rings of whipped cream around the cake. Pile one ring in the center, another in the middle
andthe other around the rim. Arrange sour cherries in the center and between the middle and outer rings.<br>
11. Top with the final slice of cake. Brush it with the remaining syrup. Add whipped cream to the top, but save enough cream to
make 13 rosettes on top of the cake. Smooth the whipped cream around the top and sides of the cake. Use a No. 4 star pastry
tube and pipe 12 rosettes, equally spaced, around the upper rim of the cake. Make one rosette in dead center. Garnish each rosette
with one dark sweet pitted cherry. Garnish the top with scraped or grated chocolate. Hold in the referigerator. 
Yield: Twelve servings.
Note: Fresh black bing cherries may be poached in syrup, pitted and used in this recipe."<br>

"The Black Forest region of Germany is a cradle of fairy tales and legends. The magnificent forests hide many mysteries and have been
irresistible to poets, storytellers, and raconteurs since time immemorial...Small inns and hotels dot the countryside; enchanted
moss-covered trails lead into the forests of dark-trunked and heavily limbed fir trees--from which the Black Forest gets its
name...Out of the kitchens come veal, venison, wild boar, and green salads, along with other delicacies...The cooking of the
Black Forest is substantial and plentiful. The Black Forest is also a haven for mushroom gatherers...The most prized are the 'Steinpiolz', or 
yellow buletus, which are eaten sauteed in butter, used as a flavoring for sauces, or dried on long strings for the winter

Morels, or 'Speisemorchel', are marvelous sauteed in butter and added to omelettes and other egg dishes or to delicate veal and
chicken creations. Some of these dishes can be traced to the times of the Nibelungen and the German knights. Pork is prepared

Blackout Cake, a 3-4 layer butter cake frosted with chocolate icing, is fondly recalled by Brooklynites devoted to

"Black-Out Cake" dates to WWII. The place? Midwest USA. The cake? Yellow with chocolate icing. The chocolate-on-chocolate layer cake version iced with chocolate surfaces in Texas about the same time

Ebingers invented this cake. No doubt about it: Ebinger's made it famous.
<p>
<b>Why the name?</b><br>
Popular theory cites government-imposed WWII-era blackouts, when citizens offed lights and shuttered inside for safety. We find no print evidence confirming this 
connection. Ebingerists attribute the cake's name to famous NYC blackouts: 1965, 1977, (& sometimes?) 2004. Chocolate on chocolate (black on black) lends well to this
appelation.

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Bundt cake</b></font><br>
Most foods are not invented. They evolve. The same holds true for bakeware. Food historians generally credit H. David 
Dalquist of Nordic Ware (Minneapolis MN) for creating the first aluminum pan called "bundt" in 1950. It was not a new 
invention. It was, rather, an economically produced aluminum version of a traditional European <a href="foodcakes.html#kugelhopf">kugelhopf</a> mold. 
Bundt cakes gained national attention in 1966 when the <a href="foodcakes.html#tunnel">Tunnel of Fudge</a> took first prize at the
Pillsbury Bake Off.<p>
<b>The popular story of the American bundt pan</b><br>
"In 1950, a group of Minneapolis women, members of Hadassah, approached Nordic Products owner H. David Dalquist and asked him to make an aluminum 
version of the cast-iron kugelhupf pan common in Euorpe. Obligingly, he made a few for the members and a few extra for the public. Not many of these fluted tube  
pans sold until ten years later when the new <i>Good Housekeeping Cookbook</i> showed a pound cake that had been baked in one of them. Suddenly every woman
 wanted a pan just like it. What really put the Bundt pan on the culinary map of America, however, was the Tunnel of Fudge Cake, which made the finals of the 
1966 Pillsbury Bake-Off Contest. Bundt, by the way, is now a registered trademark...By 1972 the grand prize winner in the Pillsbury Bake-Off Contest was a 
Bundt Streusel Spice Cake and eleven top winners also called for a Bundt pan; that same year Pillsbury sold $25 million worth of its new Bundt cake mixes. It's
 strange to think that fifty years ago there were no Bundt cakes because there were no Bundt cake pans. Today, more than forty million pans exist in America..."<br>

"Bundt historic? You betcha: The Smithsonian says the icon cake of '60s comfort food, its creator and the company he co-founded all deserve a
place beside our greatest treasures," Tom Webb. Feb. 23--Ruby slippers, space capsules and dinosaur bones -- make some room. The Bundt pan, that
made-in-Minnesota creation that became an American icon, is on its way to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. Museum curators are in the Twin
Cities this week, where they're gathering up one of the original aluminum Bundt cake pans, invented in 1950 by H. David Dalquist, co-founder of the
cookware company Nordic Ware. Some 60 million Bundt pans later, all of America is familiar with O-shaped cakes, drizzled icings and gooey
centers. "It's shaped, in some small way, American culture and how we entertain," said David Dalquist, son of the Bundt cake inventor and the
current president and CEO of Nordic Ware. While the Smithsonian curators are big on the Bundt, what has really wowed them is the almost perfectly
preserved record of an American business that made such an impact on consumer tastes, popular culture and everyday life. The Dalquist family
has owned the St. Louis Park-based business for six decades. "At the (Smithsonian's) American History Museum, we collect objects and documents
that represent a wide range of important themes in American history and American life," said Paula Johnson, a Smithsonian curator. "The Nordic
Ware story really relates to so many of these themes: entrepreneurship, innovation and the changes in American foodways in the 20th century. "It's
the whole story, it's the depth and breadth that we're after," Johnson added. "But the Bundt pan was the way in." This week, Smithsonian officials are packing up 30 cubic feet of old paperwork, engineering drawings, recipe books and early advertisements along with sand-cast molds of bunny cakes and Santa cakes,
microwave-cooking devices and financial ledgers. "My dad hung on to everything -- he was one of these collectors -- so we literally have boxes
of stuff from over the years," Dalquist said. The family basement has been "like an archeological dig for them," he added. The Smithsonian is charged
with documenting the story of America, and "it's really hard to do American history without doing food," Johnson said. So museum officials
travel the country to preserve pieces of that story a morsel at a time. To date, they've collected Julia Child's kitchen, chocolate molds from
Hershey's, a Krispy Kreme doughnut-making machine, a 1928 bread slicer and more. Eventually, it all will wind up at the National Museum of American
History, part of the constellation of museums that make up the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. The Smithsonian houses many great national
treasures, including the original Star-Spangled Banner, the Wright Brothers' airplane, Charles Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis and the Apollo
11 space capsule.  Currently, the American History museum is being renovated. But even when it reopens, Johnson said, visitors aren't immediately likely to find a
Bundt pan next to such famed icons as Dorothy's ruby slippers or George Washington's military uniform. "We always collect things, for now and in
the future," Johnson said. "We have to take the long view. Even though we may not be able to do a big food-related exhibit in the immediate future,
that's always in the back of our minds. ... So we have to start collecting now. This is how we begin." Nordic Ware was founded in 1946 by H. David
and Dorothy Dalquist. In its early years, the struggling company specialized in making Scandinavian cookie-making items. Then Dalquist "was
approached by a group of local women from the local Hadassah society," said Dana Norsten, the company's spokeswoman. "They had an old-world,
heavy, heavy ceramic pan with a hole in the middle, called a Kugelhopf." The women wondered if Dalquist would make a lighter-weight aluminum pan.
He did, adding the signature folds and later giving it the distinctive name, Bundt. Yet for years, the Bundt pan wasn't a particularly big hit.
Then in 1966, a Pillsbury Bake-off winner used the Bundt pan to create the "Tunnel of Fudge" cake -- and it rocketed the Bundt pan to fame. "It was
just like a frenzy," David Dalquist said. In the 1970s, Pillsbury introduced a popular line of Bundt cake mixes. Nordic Ware long ago
branched out into other kitchenware lines, including its Micro-Go-Round food rotator, which remains popular. The company still sells a lot of
Bundt pans, too. But the kitchenware business has changed dramatically. "We are one of only very few people who are still manufacturing in this
country," Dalquist said. "Most of them have moved overseas. It's almost all imported today." The elder Dalquist died in 2005, but his widow and
Nordic Ware co-founder has been a rich source of material for the Smithsonian curators. And what would the inventor of the Bundt pan think
of his life's work ending up in the Smithsonian? "My dad was kind of a publicity-shy kind of person," Dalquist said. "So I think he'd be amazed
that there was so much interest in the company and his products."<br>

"It seems that in "The Bundt Pan Man, Letting Them Eat Cake" [Style, Jan. 11], Hank Stuever wants to have his cake and eat it too. How else could he
have come up with the historically incorrect claim that the Bundt pan was "invented" in America (just the "t" in Bundt was invented here)? Stuever
writes: "According to an obituary in the Los Angeles Times, the ladies of a Minnesota chapter of Hadassah, the Jewish volunteer organization, sensed
the need 55 years ago and went to the Dalquists at Nordic Ware with a request: Please replicate this old ceramic dish that somebody's
grandmother had kept for years and years to bake a dessert called kugelhopf." The meanings of "replicate" are "duplicate" or "repeat," a far
cry from "invent." Actually, the pan had been invented and used in Europe much earlier. So what did H. David Dalquist really replicate back then?
Webster's Third New International Dictionary gives an answer under the German names "gugelhupf," "kugelhopf" or "gugelhopf" : a semisweet cake
usually of yeast-leavened dough containing raisins, citron and nuts and baked in a fluted tube pan. And the German Brockhaus Dictionary of 1935
defines the cake baked in a fluted and grooved pan as "gugelhupf," a term used primarily in southern Germany and Austria (and with some linguistic
roots traced to Latin). In northern Germany it is called "bundkuchen." Contrary to Stuever's somewhat mystic translation effort in this context,
the German word "bund" originated from bundling or wrapping the cake's dough around the pan's center hole. As for the pan's fluted and grooved
design, it allows for more of the dough to get exposed to the pan's inner surface than a smooth design would, and provides for a more evenly and
deeper heat distribution into the dough. This specific design feature, discovered and applied hundreds of years ago in Europe, apparently was
successfully replicated and copied by Dalquist. I grew up in Germany in the 1930s, and my mother baked a gugelhupf about once a month. The
gugelhupf and its pan have been ubiquitous in German households for centuries; Stuever's claim that Dalquist gave "the world" millions of Bundt pans is a bit of an exaggeration. Giving them to America would have sounded more plausible. And may H. David Dalquist rest in peace."<br>

<b>About Nordic ware</b><p> 
"...As Nordic Ware, the company
that invented the beloved Bundt cake pans, marks its 60th anniversary this year, we asked readers to submit stories about the Bundt pans theyve used
for decades in their kitchens. Retired teacher Mildred H. Curtis, 85, of Altus said just reading about our search for Bundt cake memories motivated
her to go into the kitchen and pull out her Bundt pan, stored in its original box, along with the recipe book that came with the pan. She
quilts at her church each week, and when its her turn to provide lunch for the quilters, the menu usually includes a Bundt cake she makes with a
German chocolate cake mix embellished with additional ingredients such as canned coconut pecan frosting. I have given away many of my cooking pans
because I do not cook like I used to, but the Bundt pan will be the last to go, Curtis wrote...Oklahomans are definitely creative when it comes to using their Bundt cake pans, which may be why Nordic Ware has thrived for six decades. Its not the only company making pans that turn out elaborate cakes, but it has been an
industry leader since the Minnesota company began in 1946. In recent years, Nordic Ware has stepped up introduction of new and more elaborately
detailed cake pans that now are common in gourmet shops. The Castle pan is one of the newest such designs, Nordic Ware spokeswoman
Dana Norsten said...The family-run company started out by making ethnic cake pans like the Rosette Iron, Ebleskiver pan and the Krumkake Iron. That changed in 1950, when the Minneapolis chapter of the Hadassah Society asked company founder, the late H. David Dalquist, to make a bund pan similar to one a member had received from her German grandmother. Bund, the German word for gathering, was an appropriate name because the fluted cake was often
served at a gathering or party. According to Nordic Ware, Dalquist made the pan from cast aluminum and decided to make a few extra bund pans to
sell at department stores. When Nordic Ware filed for a trademark for the pan, the name was changed from bund to Bundt. The rest, as they say, is
history. The pans really hit the big time in 1966, when Houston homemaker Ella Helfrich used a Bundt cake pan for her Tunnel of Fudge Cake recipe in the
Pillsbury Bake-Off Contest. She won second place in the contest, and Pillsbury fielded more than 200,000 requests for help in finding the Bundt
pans. Nordic Ware stepped up production, working around the clock to meet consumer demand. Bundt cookbooks, with recipes created and tested by
Dalquists wife, Dorothy, followed. When she and her staff baked cakes to test for the cookbooks, Nordic Wares employee lunchrooms were always
well supplied with Bundt cakes, and they were delivered to food shelters and churches, as well, Norsten said. Dorothy Dalquist, 80, still helps
promote the company thats run by her son, David Dalquist. In 1971, Pillsbury rolled out a line of Bundt cake mixes licensed by Nordic Ware.
Those mixes eventually disappeared from supermarket shelves in the 1980s. Nordic Ware has reintroduced the cake mixes in more upscale packaging.
... A few new Bundt pan designs are introduced each year. The formed aluminum pans in classic colors have made a comeback in recent years, too. For
Bundt cake pan owners who feel motivated to dust it off and bake a cake soon, we share some recipes, from the popular Tunnel of Fudge Cake to a
slimmed-down pound cake and even a cherished recipe from a reader."<br>

<b>Who was David Dalquist?</b><p> 
"H. David Dalquist, whose fledgling Scandinavian cookware company developed its most famous product, the Nordic Ware Bundt pan, with Jewish
immigrant cooks, died Sunday of heart failure at his home in Edina. He was 86. The Minneapolis native had worked as a metallurgical engineer for U.S.
Steel in Duluth for two years after receiving a degree in chemical engineering from the University of Minnesota in the early 1940s. He served
in the Navy during World War II as a radar technician aboard a destroyer in the Pacific. After the war, he and his brother, Mark, started a company
called Plastics for Industry, said his son, David of Minnetonka. Soon it evolved into Maid of Scandinavia, a specialty cookware company run by
Mark, and Northland Aluminum Products, Dave's company, which manufactured Nordic Ware...Said his son, "My dad believed the common person could do great things if you give them a chance," and
that included keeping his factory in the heart of a U.S. metropolitan area instead of moving it to a foreign country. Dalquist helped develop
thermoset plastic molding technology to make products to use in microwave ovens. "He was very good at recognizing product niches, and what the
consumer was looking for," said Gene Karlson, a company vice president." <br>

measuring everthing you are going to use in your cake), make a cavity in the flour, stir in the yeast and a scant cupful of lukewarm milk, make a nice batter, and let
 it rise until you have prepared the following: Rub three-quarters of a cup of butter and three-quarters of a cup of powdered sugar to a cream, just as you would
 for cup cake, then add gradually one egg at a time, using from four to five altogether, and stirring all the time in one direction. Work in your risen batter, a couple 
of spoonfuls at a time, between each egg. Grate 

in the peel of a lemon or an orange. Butter the form well that the cake is to be baked in (do this always before you begin to work). Put in your dough, set it in a

Kugelhopf is a yeast-based cake similar to French <a href="foodbreads.html#brioche">brioche</a>. It is typically baked in a mold with a funnel-shaped center insert to achieve
a tall, round, ring-shaped cake. "Kugel" means "round," in German. "Kugel" means a kind of pudding in Yiddish (per the Oxford English Dictionary). Where did this 
recipe originate? Vienna, Germany & France (Alsace) are all credited, along with much foodlore. Culinary traditions don't neatly adhere to political divisions. The
<i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> defines "kugelhopf as "light Austian cake bread." Variant
spellings (Gugelhuph &c.) strongly suggest this recipe traveled. The general concensus of food writers is this recipe orginated in Austria. We cannot confirm or deny 
this. 
<p>
"A kugelhopf is a cake made from a yeast-based brioche-like dough in a characteristic shape, rather like an inverted flower pot with a hole down the middle; it 
usually 
contains raisins and currants and is dusted with icing sugar. As its name suggests, it originated in Germany and particuarly Austria (where it is usually called a 
gugelhupf), but it is now perhaps chiefly associated with Alsace. There are several no doubt equally apocryophal stories concerning its introduction to France from
 further east, one of which implicates Austrian-born Marie-Antoinette's partiality for such cakes."<br>

<p>
"Kugelhopf, a rich, light, delicate yeast cake, made from flour, eggs, butter, and sugar. It is related to Brioche, Baba, and Savarin...the identifying characteristic of 
kugelhopf is its tall ring shape. It is derived from the mould in which it is baked, round and deep, with a central funnel, and flouted with decorative swirls. After 
baking, the cake is turned out and dusted with icing sugar which catches in the pattern...Kugelhopf is one of the best-known C. European bakery products...It is 
made in a wide belt from Alsace...through parts of Germany...and Poland; and into Austria...The traditional pattern  in C. Europe was for the kugelhopf to be 
baked for Sunday breakfast, when the village baker had his day off. It is also popular with Jewish communities who have settled in these areas."<br>

"Cakes baked in Kugelhopf form...are very popular is Germany, Austria and Alsace. They may be simple sand cakes...marble cakes, poundcakes...or they may be made of a
rich yeast dough as the classic Kugelhopf. The Kuglhopf is the original cake to be baked in this high, round, fluted center-tube mold, a shape created
after the Turks were defeated at the gates  of Vienna in 1683. The Viennese bakers who helped defend their city during the seige created this victory cake, modeling
it after the sultan's turban."<br>

<b>[1966]<br>
"Tunnel of Fudge Cake</b><br>
1 1/2 cups butter or margarine, softened<br>
6 eggs<br>
1 1/2 cups sugar<br>
2 cups Pillsbury's Best All Purpose Flour<br>
1 package Pillsbury Two Layer Size Buttercream Double Dutch Frosting Mix<br>
2 cups chopped walnuts or pecans<br>
Oven 350 degrees F.    10-inch tube cake<br>
Cream butter in large mixer bowl at high speed of mixer. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Gradually add sugar; 
continue creaming at high speed until light and fluffy. By hand, stir in flour, frosting mix, and walnuts until well-blended. 
Pour batter into greased Bundt pan or 10-inch Angel Food tube pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 60-65 minutes. Cool 2 hours; remove from
pan. Cool completely before serving. NOTE: Walnuts, Double Dutch Fudge Frosting Mix and butter are key to the success of this unusal

Food-on-a-stick is a perennial favorite with Americans. Portable, inexpensive, and personally portioned, they are 
ubiquitous fair fare. Our first reaction to cake pops was this surely must have been a Betty Crocker invention. We 
examined several 1960s (read: baby boomer era) children's party/cake books for clues. While we did not find cake pops, we 
did find lollipop cookies, which are generally the same idea. In 2002 cheesecake pops (or lollipops) became popular. Cake 
pops, as we know them today ala Starbucks, are generally credited to Angie Dudley, proprietress of Bakerella.com blog. Our 
research indicates she launched cake pops in 2007. The 'craze' was fanned by her cookbook (2010) and Starbucks menu 
addition (2011). Timing is everything. Consumers 
with deep purses and adventurous tastes are always ready for something new. And then? 
 There is a point when small becomes too small. A cake pop is about the size of a petit fours. When was the last time you 
are one petit four & called it quits?

"What's less than 2 inches wide, covered in candy and impossibly adorable? A cake pop, those irresistibly moist 
confections made by mixing crumbled cake and frosting. The blogger Bakerella first unleashed these miniature cakes on 
sticks back in 2007. Once they went viral, pastry chefs, home bakers, even Starbucks jumped on the trend, creating 
ambitious shapes and speckled surprises at about 200 calories a pop. As a result, a miniature movement is upon us. 
Inspired by the pops' portability, moderate calorie content and undeniable cute factor, pastry chefs are coming up with 
miniature versions of other desserts, from cookies and cupcakes to seasonal tarts, whoopie pies and eclairs no bigger than
 a cocktail wiener. There is much to love about these mini treats, says Paulina Tsagaris, whose Campbell, Calif.-based 
boutique catering company, Sweet Luna Desserts, specializes in miniature treats. "They're small, so you don't have to 
feel guilty," says Tsagaris. "And they're usually full of flavor, so you're left feeling satisfied in one or two bites." 
Each month, Tsagaris fills orders for thousands of customized cake pops. Her tangy lemon curd tarts are a hit at weddings.
 She serves banana cream custard in shot glasses small enough to make even an ogre feel dainty. The queen of candy-coated
 cake pops is Angie Dudley, better known as Bakerella, the Georgia-based blogging sensation. Her precious Easter basket
 pops  with sugar cones for baskets and green Sour Patch straws for handles  are so intricately designed, one look would
 make most novices retreat to their kitchens with a bag of Tollhouse Break and Bake. But Dudley swears that even detailed 
pops are not difficult. All it takes is box cake mix, ready-made frosting, an edible ink pen, tons of candy  and vision. 
"I don't look at candy as something to eat anymore," says Dudley, the author of "Cake Pops: Tips, Tricks, and Recipes for 
More Than 40 Irresistible Mini Treats" (Chronicle Books, 2010). A second book focused on winter holiday pops is due out 
this year. "I look at it as inspiration. I look at it proportionally. A Junior Mint is a hat. Coated sunflower seeds make

<b>Who is Angie Dudley? </b><br>
"Bakerella -- the food blogger formerly known as Angie Dudley -- used to bake only when she got a craving for something 
like chocolate chip cookies. It wasn't until she took a Whole Foods cake decorating class with Angie Mosier, founder of 
Blue Eyed Daisy Bakeshop in Palmetto, that she ventured beyond store-bought mixes. Mosier's lesson on basket-weave 
frosting rocked Dudley's world. The Suwanee graphic designer started spending weekends in the kitchen. In late 2007, she
 launched her blog and registered with Flickr to submit her creations to top-rated blog Cupcakes Take the Cake -- picking 
"Bakerella" for both online accounts simply so she wouldn't forget the usernames. She had made cake "balls" before, but 
only cupcakes would be considered by CTTC. So she figured out a way to turn the cake spheres into cupcakes using a 
flower-shaped cookie cutter -- and, for the first time, she put them on a stick, which developed into her specialty. Not 
only did CTTC love Dudley's confections, but The Martha Stewart Show invited her to appear during Cupcake Week. The 
blogosphere erupted, as did Dudley's imagination. Soon she was using candy corn for bunny ears and turkey feathers. 
Pretzels turned into deer antlers, and French burnt peanuts into curly red clown hair. National ads now scroll on her 
website, which won the 2010 Bloggie for best food blog. Her first book, the spiral-bound Cake Pops, was released last fall,
 immediately breaking into the top ten of the New York Times bestselling advice books. But Dudley, age thirty-eight,
 finds her newfound celebrity status "surreal." During a book tour stop in New York, Gossip Girl actress Blake Lively 
invited her over to bake -- proving they were kindred spirits by whipping out a can of edible silver luster spray to
 polish off a tin man." <br>

<a name="caramelcake">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Caramel cake</b></font><br>
18th century English and American cake recipes regularly employ sugar (in various
forms: molasses, treacle, granulated), milk/cream, flour, eggs, rising agents, and spices. Some of
these might have produced recipes similar to what we know today as caramel cake. None of these
recipes go by that name. Recipes with the term "caramel" in the title (cake, candy, icing, sauce,
custard, coloring etc.) surface in the 1870s.
What is <a href="foodcandy.html#caramel">caramel</a>?
<p>
<b>Southern USA tradition?</b><br>
Food writers generally agree caramel cake is a favorite in the American south. This may indicate a
French culinary descent. The earliest recipes we
find for caramel cake in a U.S. were printed the mid-1870s. These recipes were published in newspapers throughout the country; 
no special mention of Southern tradition. <i>Mrs. Porter's New Southern Cookery Book</i> [1871], considered by some to be
the quintessential catalog of 19th century baked goods, does not include this item. M.C. Tyree's <i>Housekeeping in Old
Virginia</i> [1879] offers a recipe for Caramel Pudding but not Caramel Cake. 
<p>
Early Caramel cakes were filled and iced but not multi-layered. Many included chocolate. Today's popular <a href="foodcakes.html#7layercaramel">
Seven Layer Caramel Cake</a> appears to be a new twist on an old tradition.
<br>
<blockquote>
<b>[1877]<br>
"Caramel Cake.</b><br>
One cup butter, two of sugar, a scant cup milk, one and a half cups flour, cup corn starch, whites
of seven eggs, three tea-spoons baking-powder in the flour; bake in a long pan. Take half pound
brown sugar, scant quarter pound chocolate, half cup milk, butter size of an egg, two tea-spoons
vanilla; mix thoroughly and cook as syrup until stiff enough to spread; spread on cake and set in
the oven to dry."

<b>Seven Layer Caramel Cake</b><br>
Artistic combinations of cakes/biscuits with custards/creams were first made in Renaissance
Europe. Think: <a href="foodfaq1.html#englishtrifle">English Trifle</a>. 
Fancy/milti-layered cakes are generally traced to the late 18th/early 19th century. Austria and France in particular.
19th century Viennese bakers were famous for creating exquisite cakes of many layers filled with
creams, custards, jellies and other icings. Some of these also contained chocolate. <a href="foodcakes.html#dobos">Dobos torte</a>
was a popular multilayered chocolate cake originating in 19th century Hungary. Viennese bakers
perfected multi-layered torts (sponge filled with chocolate and fruit fillings). Careme elevated
French patisserie to an art, creating petits fours and other fancy layered confections.
<p>
<b>Why the number 7?</b><br>
The number 7 (as in the number of layers composing cake that is your specialty) has long been
considered a good/lucky number in many cultures. It is probably no accident early bakers
selected this particular number. Other layers (5, 12) are also popular. 
<p>
"Southern cake bakers are a breed apart. Maybe it's something in the water or maybe it's because
dessert is considered one of the five basic food groups in the South, but an old-fashioned
southern cake is a truly wondrous thing. Which is why South Carolina native Caroline Ragsdale
Reutter's seven-layer caramel cake brought us to our knees. It is a huge, gorgeous, rich,
incredibly sweet confection that seduces you with its buttery, brown-sugar aroma, velvety yellow
cake layers and creamy caramel frosting. It's an old recipe, says Reutter, who now lives in
Annapolis, "that's gone to the grave with a lot of people." Since she began selling the cakes
commercially about five years ago, she's gotten accustomed to getting tearful phone calls and
emotional e-mails from people telling her, "This was my grandmother's cake. Just tasting it
brings back so many memories." The cake weighs five pounds and can serve a large number of
guests, mainly because it is best enjoyed in thin slices, slightly chilled. Even better, it can be
frozen and refrozen without harm to its flavor or texture. Reutter says her female customers, in
particular, like to keep one in the freezer. "They tell me they cut a thin sliver to eat with a cup of
black coffee in the morning and that's breakfast," she confides. Reutter grew up in Lake City,
S.C., a farming town of 8,000 people in the heart of the tobacco belt. The cake is one she grew up
eating. "It's an old southern recipe. Everyone made it, not just my family," she says. She first
baked it for friends at her youngest son's christening luncheon 22 years ago. They loved it and
soon began ordering the cakes and urging her to go into business. "But I had two young children
and there just wasn't time," she says. Once her sons were grown and safely off to college, she
began her cake business in earnest, adding a seven-layer chocolate cake with fudge icing as well.
Although she started out as a one-woman operation, when a Palm Beach, Fla., company ordered
2,000 cakes five years ago, "that's when I knew it was no longer a hobby," she says. Last year,
she sent out more than 10,000 cakes over the holidays. For the upcoming holidays, Caroline's
Cakes and its 30 employees plan to move into a retail bakery space on Whitehall Road in
Annapolis, (exit 30) off Route 50 by the end of the month."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Carrot cake</b></font><br>
According to the food historians, our modern carrot cake most likely descended from Medieval
carrot puddings
enjoyed by people in Europe. Historic evidence suggests Arab cooks of the <a href="foodcakes.html#10thcarrot:>10th century</a> enjoyed similar recipes. <a href="#carrots">Carrots</a> are an old world food.
imported to the Americas by European settlers. In the 20th century carrot cake was re-introduced
as a
"healthy alternative" to traditional desserts. The first time was due to necessity; the second time
was
spurred by the popular [though oftimes misguided] wave of health foods. Is today's carrot cake
healthy? It
can be. It all depends upon the ingredients.
<p>
"In the Middle Ages in Europe, when sweeteners were scarce and expensive, carrots were used in
sweet
cakes and desserts. In Britain...carrot puddings...often appeared in recipe books in the 18th and
19th
centuries. Such uses were revived in Britain during the second World War, when the Ministry of
Food
disseminated recipes for carrot Christmas pudding, carrot cake, and so on and survive in a small
way to the
present day. Indeed, carrot cakes have enjoyed a revival in Britain in the last quarter of the 20th
century.
They are perceived as 'healthy' cakes, a perception fortified by the use of brown sugar and
wholemeal flour
and the inclusion of chopped nuts, and only slightly compromised by the cream cheese and sugar
icing
which appears on some versions."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.

"In her <i>New York Cookbook</i> (1992), Molly O'Neill says that George Washington was
served a carrot
tea cake at Fraunces Tavern in lower Manhattan. The date: November 25, 1783. The occasion:
British
Evacuation Day. She offers an adaptation of that early recipe, which was printed in <i>The
Thirteen
Colonies Cookbook</i> (1975) by Mary Donovan, Amy Hatrack, and Frances Schull. It isn't so
very different
from the carrot cakes of today. Yet strangely, carrot cakes are noticeably absent from American
cookbooks
right through the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth. Before developing a new
pudding-included
carrot and spice cake mix, Pillsbury researched carrot cake in depth, even staged a nation-wide
contest to
locate America's first-published carrot cake recipe. Their finding: A carrot cake in <i>The
Twentieth Century
Bride's Cookbook</i> published in 1929 by a Wichita, Kansas, woman's club. Running a close
second was
a carrot cake printed in a 1930 <i>Chicago Daily News Cookbook</i>...Several carrot cake
contestants also
sent Pillsbury a complicated, two-day affair that Peg Bracken had included in one of her magazine
columns

<blockquote>
<b>[10th century Arabian cookery]<br>
<a name="10thcarrot">
T'Khabis al-jazar (Carrots): (A carrot pudding)</b><br>
Choose fresh tender and sweet carrots. Peel them and thinly slice them crosswise. For each pound of honey use 3 pounds of these carrots. Boil the honey and remove its froth. Pound the carrot in a stone mortar. Set a clean copper cauldron with a rounded bottom on a trivet on the fire, and put in it the skimmed honey and carrots. Cook the mixture on medium fire until the carrots fall apart.
Add walnut oil to the pot. For each pound of homey used add 2/3 cup of oil. Pistachio oil will be the best for it, but you can also use fresh oil of almond or sesame. Add the oil before the honey starts to thicken. However you do not need to stir the pot. You only scrape the bottom gently when mixture starts to thicken to prevent it from sticking to it. To check for doneness, use a stick or a spoon to see whether the pudding is thick enough or not yet.
When pudding becomes thick, put the pot down, and spread the dessert on a copper platter. Set it aside to cool down before serving. It will be firm and delicious."<br>

I presume a carrot cake could be made by the recipe for apple sauce cake, but I have so many recipes for carrot cakes that I have never settled down
to finding out what is what among them. A clipped recipe is for a crocus carrot cake, which title suggests its suitability for this
season. The author of the recipe was the late Marion Harris Neal. It reads: 'Rub four good sized cooked carrots through a sieve, add two
tablespoons of ground almonds, three tablespoons of sugar, the grated rind and strained juice of half a lemon, the well beaten yolks 
of four eggs, three tablespoons of melted butter, and the whites of the eggs beaten stiffly. Pour into a small baking tin that has been
lined with pastry. Bake in a hot oven and serve hot or cold, cut in squares.' This is readily done like a pie than a cake, but baked in a
small square tin lined with crust it will undoubtedly bear a resemblance to cheese cake, which we know is more of a 
compromise between bread and pie than like cake."<br>

<b>About carrots</b><p>
Carrots are an "Old World" vegetable. They adapted readily to "New World" soil. Notes here:
<p>
"Carrot. A root vegetable of the Umbelliferae family--and thus related to parsley, dill, and
celery...although
originally native to Afghanistan, is now found all over the world in many shapes, sizes, and
colors."<br>

"The wild carrot, which grows in much of W. Asia and Europe, has a tiny and acrid tasting root.
However,
when it is cultivated in favourable conditions the roots of successive generations enlarge quickly.
So the
evolution of cultivars with enlarged roots is easily explained; indeed, what is puzzling is that it
seems to have
taken a very long time for D. Carota var sativa , as the modern cultivated carrot is know, to
appear. The
puzzle is all the greater because archaeologists have found traces of carrot seed at prehistoric lake
dwellings in Switzerland. Also, the plant is included in a list of vegetables grown in the royal
garden of
Babylon in the 8th century BC. Here there is a clue: the plant is not in the list of ordinary
vegetables but in
that or aromatic herbs. It was probably being grown for its leaves or seeds, both of which have a
pleasant
carrot fragrance. It seems likely that this had also been the purpose of carrot cultivation in
classical times,
for there is little or no evidence to suggest that the Greeks and Romans enjoyed eating the roots.
Many
writers state that the carrot in something like its modern form was brought westwards, at least as
far as the
Arab Afghanistan, where the very dark red, even purple, carrots of antiquity are still grown. The
introduction
is variously dated at the 8th or 10th century AD, ie the period of Arab expansion in to the Middle
East and C.
Asia. This fits well enough with the fact that the earliest surviving clear description of the carrot
dates from
the first half of the 12th century, and was by an Arab writer...The first sign of truly orange carrots
is in Dutch
paintings of the 17th century...Cultivated carrots of the European type were brought to the New
World
before 1565..."<br>

"Adding to the confusion of early carrot history is the wold white carrot...that is native to Europe
and was
subsequently naturalized in America. Now popularly known as Queen Anne's lace, the most
famous for its
ornamental flower, the woody root has been used interchageably with its visually similar cousin,
the
parsnip...The late-fourth-century Roman cookery book of Apicius lists recipes suitable for either
carrots
(presumably wild and cultivated) or parsnips, advice repeated nearly fifteen hundred years later in
Lettice
Bryan's <i>The Kentucky Housewife</i> (1839) that "carrots may be cooked in every respect like
parsnips."
English carrots were the first to be introduced into the colonies, accompanying colonists to
Jamestown in
1609 and early Pilgrims to Massachusetts no later than 1629, where they grew "biger and
sweeter" than
anything found in England. Dutch Menonnites brought orange and scarlet carrots with them into
Pennsylvania, from whence they spread through the rest of the colonies."<br>

<a name="chiffoncake">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Chiffon cake</b></font><br>
Chiffon cake takes two meanings in the culinary world. The earlier one, <a href="foodcakes.html#chiffongelatine">descending from Chiffon 
Pie</a> is mostly lost to history. Food historians generally credit <a href="http://www.larchmontchronicle.com/ArchiveDetail.asp?ArchiveID=374">
Harry Baker</a>, a Los Angeles insurance salesman, for the "invention" of the iconic 1940s confection that was promoted as
"The first new cake in 100 years."
<p>
As the story goes, Mr. Baker "invented" this cake by subsituting salad oil for butter in his angel food cake recipe. He 
sold the formula to General Mills in the late 1940s. The corporate version of this cake, promoting General Mill's products 
(flour & salad oil) debuted in 1947. Recipes proliferated. Was Mr. Baker's idea truly revolutionary? Possibly, probably. We find
no print evidence of salad-oil angel cakes predating his 1920s claim. We think, based on primary evidence, his recipe was 
inspired by popular <a href="foodcakes.html#oilcake">salad oil cakes</a> actively promoted by savvy corporate marketers. Until evidenced
to the contrary, the Harry Baker legend lives on.
<p>
Our survey of cookbooks and magazine/newpaper articles confirms Chiffon cake was agressively
promoted from the late 1940s to early 1960s.
New recipes were introduced two or three times monthly  in the <i>New York Times</I> Sunday
Magazine section commencing February 1949. This survey  also reveals other companies took
advantage of the chiffon cake craze. An ad titled "Ever make a cake with Mazola?" published by
Corn Products Refining Company (<i>New York Times</i>, March 27, 1947, SM p. 41) states
"This is the new "Shadow cake. You'll love its rich chocolate flavor, its wonderful texture. Like
the famous "Chiffon" cake, it is easy to make with Mazola, the pure golden oil that "make so
many good things...better"." Unlike the General Mills/Betty Crocker ads, this one does not
provide a recipe. It invites the reader to send away for a free recipe book. [NOTE: we do not own a copy of the 1947 book. We do
have the recipe from the <a href="foodcakes.html#mazolachiffon">1951</a> booklet. 
<p>
"Betty Crocker played a part in the notorious rise of one very expensive cake--Chiffon, heralded
as "the first new cake in 100 years!" Before 1948, cakes were traditionally classified as either
butter or sponge...But an aptly named cake baker, Harry Baker, from Hollywood, California,
challenged conventional cake wisdom and started his own mini baking revolution. Baker,
originally an insurance salesman and recreational cook, enjoyed all cakes, but dreamed of
combining the richness of butter cake with the lightness of sponge cake...Baker's ambitious
pursuit took years...in 1927, his efforts brought forth an upside-down cake that was described as
light, tender, delicate, glamorous, and delicious, with sensational volume. Dessert lovers clamored
for a taste, hoping to name Baker's reputed mystery ingredient. Baker doggedly guarded his
secret...As word of Baker's miracle cake spread throughout Hollywood, orders soared beyond his
capacity to fill them...Both MGM and RKO granted screen time to his creations, and chiffon cake
as added to the menu at the Brown Derby restaurant...Almost twenty years passed before Baker
went public with the recipe, timing the sale of his secret of the lifting of wartime restrictions. After
reading the Fortune magazine citation of Betty Crocker as the second most popular woman in
America, he decided to pay her a visit. Rumors of Baker's Hollywood mystery cake preceded
him. Upon his arrival in Minneapolis, intrigued General Mills executives offered him free run of
Betty's kitchens...Once samples of his cake had eared the Betty Crocker seal of approval,
negotiations began. However, General Mills would not strike a deal until the secret ingredient was
revealed. With that, baker exposed his cake for what it was: flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, five
egg yolks, a cup of egg whites, lemon rind, cream of tartar, and, instead of shortening, cooking
oil. While Baker contemplated what he would do with the large (undisclosed) sum, Betty's
staffers got to work. Behind closed doors, General Mills' food chemists and home economists fine
tuned Baker's somewhat unstable recipe for eleven months. Finally, in 1948, the recipe for Betty
Crocker's Orange Chiffon Cake debuted in <i>Better Homes and Gardens</i>, <i>Ladies' Home
Journal</i>, and <i>McCall's</i>. <i>The Minneapolis Tribune</i> and others broke the news
under the headline <i>Mystery Cake--Secred Ingredient X Revealed for Baking Mammoth
Chiffon</i>...General Mills conducted market research on the Chiffon Cake and concluded it a
success."<br>

"The first dessert the Brown Derby ever served was a cake made by a former bond salesman
named Harry Baker. It was a fluffy, golden cake, neither angel food nor sponge, but infinately
lighter and more delicious than either. For almost twenty years Baker baked these cakes for the
Derby, refusing to divulge the secret of its recipe. In 1947 he took it to General Mills in
Minneapolis, and they paid him handsomely for the recipe. Lauched as  the first new cake idea in
a hundred years," this is the famous </i> Cake, which differs only slightly from the Brown
Derby favorite."<br>

"Chiffon. A very light, sweet, fluffy filing for pie, cake or pudding. The word is from the French
meaning "rag"...Chiffon pie is first mentioned in American print in 1929...The 1931 edition of
Irma S. Rombauer's <i>Joy of Cooking</i> gave a recipe for lemon chiffon, and the <i>Better
Homes and Gardens Heritage Cook Book</i> (1975) says that "chiffon cake was invented by a
professional baker and introduced in May 1948. Made with cooking oil instead of solid shortening
and beaten--not creamed--this light cake was the first new cake to have been developed in one
hundred years of baking." Other authorities, however, credit an amateur baker with creating the
confection in 1927."<br>

"Chiffon Cake. "The first really new cake in 100 years!" trumpeted <i>Better Homes and
Gardens</i> which introduced the cake in its May 1948 issue. Neither a sponge cake nor a butter
cake, chiffon cake used the newly popular salad oil and was beaten rather than creamed. The cake
was invented by a California salesman named Harry Baker in 1927. Although he kept the recipe a
secret for many years, the cake became famous in Hollywood where Mr. Baker made it for
celebrity parties. He finally sold the recipe to General Mills in 1947--which posted gains of 20
percent on sales of cake flour after the recipe was published. Just about every flavor was popular
in chiffon cakes, with lemon and orange leading the pack."<br>

"In the late  20s, word trickled out of California of a high-rising new cake that melted in your
mouth. It's creator, a Los Angeles insurance salesman and hobby cook named Harry Baker, was
soon baking his "chiffon cake" for fancy Hollywood functions as well as for the Brown Derby
restaurants. But he wouldn't divulge his recipe until General Mills paid him for it in 1947. The
"secret ingredient," it turned out, was vegetable oil. General Mills home economists went to work
fine-tuning Baker's chiffon cake recipe, experimenting with different flavors. The company
printed the basic recipe...in a leaflet in 1948 and again in 1950 in <i>Betty Crocker's Picture
Cookbook</i>, calling this the "first new cake in a hundered years" and describing it as "light as
angel food, rich as butter cake."<br>

Baking cakes with salad oil? Confirmed. Following Crisco's lead (1913), Wesson and Mazola salad oils both promoted their their products as shortening 
substitutes in baked goods. 
 None of the cakes in Wesson's 1930 booklet were titled "chiffon," but the plain cake differs only slightly from classic recipes. 
 It possible Mr. Baker was intrigued (inspired?) by contemporary advertising when he incorporated cooking oil into his chiffon cakes.

"New Muffin Method" for making cake</b> lets you have your cake and rest too. You don't have to have a birthday so you can have a cake! Forget to count the years
 if you can bear to forego the gleaming candles, but have cake whenever you like by the new quick-and-easy way known as the 'muffin method.' You almost throw
 it together. Here's what you do. Put all your liquid ingredients (including eggs) except shortening into a mixing bowl and beat for two minutes. Add shortening, beat 
for one minute. Bake, cool, frost and enjoy! Not every cake in the cook book may be made by this method but there are enough to keep the whole family happy...
An excellent example of the 'muffin method' is given below...Quick Foundation Cake. 2 eggs, beaten; 2 cups milk; 1 teaspoon flavoring, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1

<b>CHIFFON CAKE/OIL</b><p>
The "classic" one-in-a-hundred-year chiffon cake substituted oil for traditional shortening. The recipe was promoted as revolutionary. Our research indicates this was a new twist
on a proven culinary theme. Cakes made with <a href="foodcakes.html#oilcakes">commercial salad oil</a> were promoted in the early 1930s. The dates of General Mills introduction
range from 1947-1948. Earliest recipes were published in ads placed in western USA newspapers featured Sperry Drifted Snow and homemaker Martha Meade. Both tradenames owned

"Mystery Ingredient Develops New Cake. After months of secret development behind locked doors, announcement has been made of the first completely 
new-type cake in 100 years, employing a 'secret ingredient sold by virtually every grocer but never commonly used in cake baking. The new creation is known as 
'Chiffon Cake.' The recipe combines the best qualities of the 'butter' cakes and the angel for sponge cakes, the two basic cake types now recognized. The 'mystery
 ingredient.' so termed because of the hushed experiments conducted in test kitchens for more than 11 months, turned out to be familiar salad or cooking oil. This
 liquid shortening when combined in just the right proportion with other ingredients and following a new method developed for it, results in a cake that is unique for 
high volume, richness and delicacy. Unique characteristics. The following features were listed by baking experts as typical of the Chiffon Cake's unique
 characteristic. 1. The cake is as light and delicate as the finest angel food plus a greater degree of tenderness. It has the velvetiness and 'melt-in-your-mouth' 
qualities of the finest 'butter' type cake, plus a more airy feathery quality. 2. It is a streamlined cake, quick and easy to make. Total mixing time is about 10 minutes
 compared with 25 minutes for angel food cake. 3. It takes only seven eggs, compared with thirteen for angel food recipes, yet gives a larger cake. it can be made
 in a variety of pan sizes and shapes. 4. The cake is so delicious that frosting it is not required. The cake is versatile, lends itself to a wide variety of frostings, fillings,
 and toppings. 5. It has outstanding keeping qualities. A cake stored for one week in the test kitchen was still moist. The Chiffon Cake has more moist eating quality 
than most other cakes. A testing staff baked some 400 test cakes in the year-long experiments that ended with an easy-to-follow recipe. This recipe was then tested
 by several hundred typical homemakers in Tulsa, Cincinnati and Philadelphia and is now made available to the women of America."<br>

Decadently rich tream-filled cakes, cookies and pastries have been around for hundreds of years. They
  became very popular in the 19th century. Chocolate cake likewise debuted in this time
  period, although it did not make a regular appearance until the beginning of the 20th
  century. Pain au chocolate, possibly a progenitor of chocolate molten lava cake, was
  popular in the early 20th century.
  <p>
  Our survey of articles published in USA
  newspapers and magazines confirm recipes with this moniker begin surfacing in the
  early 1990s. Print evidence confirms similar recipes existed in the early 1980s. Think: Maida Heatter. In the food world, this is not
  unusual. 
<p>
  Articles reveal the first  "molten cakes" were positioned as haute cuisine. They were served in
  trendy restaurants and featured in upscale publications (<i>Gourmet</i>, <i>Bon Appetit</i>, <i>Ladies Home
  Journal</i>). Although originally described as 'comfort food" and employing similar ingredients, it seems unlikely molten cakes originated as humble
  pudding cakes promoted by Mazola and Betty Crocker. 
<p>
Somehow, somewhere, someplace, traditional hot chocolate souffle rose through the culinary ranks, becoming Chocolate 
Souffle Cake which erupted triumphantly into Chocolate Molten Lava 
Cake. The evolution and attribution are unclear. Decadent chocolate desserts proliferated in the 1980s. 
This particular item was signature 1990s. A culinary culmination, of sorts. Upscale operations 
& chain restaurants celebrated together in this meltingly delicious chocolate glory. Disaster desserts continued to
proliferate. Think: <a href="foodcakes.html#volcanocookies">Volcano Cookies</a>

"One of the most talked-about chocolate cakes in New York City is the Chocolate Souffle Cake from Fay and Allen's Foodworks...I have heard
raves about it. It was described as a soft, moist, rich, dark chocolate mixture with a crisp, brownie-like crust! In
September 1980, my husband and I were on a tour to promote my chocolate book, and were in New York only for a few hectic days.
As we were checking out of our hotel I suddenly remembered the Chocolate Souffle Cake...I spoke to Mr. Mark Allen, the man who
bakes the cakes...He told me that he got the recipe when he attended the Culinary Institute of America. It is a flourless
mixture similar to a rich chocolate mousse, baked in  a large Bundt pan. During baking, a crisp crust forms on the outside; the
inside stays moist. The recipe calls for long, slow baking...
<p>
8 ounces semisweet chocolate<br>
8 ounces (two sticks) unsalted butter<br>
2 tablespoons salad oil<br>
8 eggs (graded large), separated<br>
1 cup granulated sugar<br>
1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>
1/4 teaspoon salt<br>
Optional: confectioners sugar<br>
<p>
Adjust a rack one-third up from the bottom of the oven and preheat the oven to 300 degrees. You will need a 10-inch Bundt pan or any other fancy-shaped
tube pan with a 12-cup capacity...Butter the pan (even if it has a nonstick lining); the best way is to use room-temperature
butter, and brush it on with a pastry brush. The sprinkle granulated sugar all over the pan; in order to get the sugar on the
tube, sprinkle it on with your fingertips. Shake the pan to coat it all with sugar, and then invert it over a piece of paper and
tap to shake excess. Set the pan aside. Break up or coarsley chop the chocolate and place it in the top of a large double
boiler over hot water on moderate heat. Cut up the butter and add it, and the oil, to the chocolate. Cover and let cook until
completely melted and smooth. Remove from the hot water. In a mixing bowl, stir the yolks a bit with a wire whisk just to mix.
Them gradually, in a few additions, whisk about half of the hot chocolate mixture into the yolks, and then, off the heat, add the
yolks to the remaining hot chocolate mixture (the mixture will thicken a bit as the heat of the chocolate cooks the eggs).
Add the sugar and vanilla and stir to mix. Set aside. In a large bowl of an electric mixer add the salt to the egg whites and beat 
until the whites hold a point when the beaters are raised but not until they are stiff or dry. Fold a few large spoonfuls of the
whites into the chocolate mixture. Then add the remaining whites and fold together gently only until incorporated. Gently
turn the mixture into the prepared pan. Bake for 2 2/4 hours. During baking the cake will rise and then sink; it will sink more
in the middle than on the edges. That is as it should be. It is O.K. Remove from the oven and let stand in the pan for about
5 minutes. Then cover the cake with an inverted serving plate. Hold the pan and the plate firmly together, and turn them
over. The sugar coating in the pan forms a crust and the cake will slide out of the pan easily. Let stand until cool or serve while
warm. If you wish, cover the top of the cake generously with confectioners sugar, sprinkling it on through a fine strainer held
over the cake. Brush excess sugar off the plate."<br>

...Wolfgang is...one of the world's greatest chefs...A hot souffle is the most elegant and posh of all desserts, but it is surprisingly
quick and easy to make. Although this must be served immediately when it is done, the preparation can be completed (in 10 to 15
minutes) up to about 2 hours before serving...It would take all of Hollywood's hyperbole to properly describe this. Itg has more
chocolate than most souffles, with a lush, rich texture and a densley bittersweet and extgravagant flavor..."<br>

"New Yorkers are calling it the best dessert. Ever. Tiramisu has had it. Creme brulee, watch out. The confection in question
is a small warm chocolate cake that, when cut, oozes with intensely rich molten chocolate. This year, some version of it
is being served in more than a dozen restaurants. New ones are added to the list almost daily. 'Sirlo wanted me to put it on the menu,'
said Jacques Torres, the pastry chef at Le Cirque, referring to Sirio Maccioni, the owner. 'A lot of people were asking for
 it.' A number of other chefs are preparing some version of this dessert...But Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the chef and co-owner
of Jo Jo, exclaimed when asked about the runny little chocolate cakes, 'They're mine!' At Jo Jo's the dessert is called 
chocolate Valrhona cake with vanilla ice cream. 'Maybe there is a surprise factor,' said Lois Freedman, the manager of 
Jo Jo, 'The description on the menu doesn't prepare people for what to expect. But it's becoming like a cult thing, with 
people saying it's the best dessert they ever had...Miss Freedman said the phenomenon was especially curious because Mr.
Vongerichten, who said he got the recipe from his mother, served the same dessert at Lafayette for two years before opening
Jo Jo, yet it had much less impact there. Perhaps it's the element of comfort, the same mode that is driving people to want
mashed potatoes in fancy restaurants. The innocent-looking cake--a classic fluted bundt shape in miniature with a dusting of
confectioner's sugar and a scoop of vanilla ice cream--has an easy, unsophisticated look about it, just like the photograph on
a box of cake mix. But the first bite reveals the rish, meltingly warm bittersweet chocolate inside--too good to be true...Mr. 
Vongerichten's recipe is elementary, calling for chocolate and butter to be melted together, then combined with eggs and egg yolks 
beaten with sugar. A little flour is sifted in, and the batter is poured into molds and baked for five minutes. 'It's simply
underbaked, so it reminds you of when you were a kid and licked the batter bowl,' said Mr. Nish, of March, where a similar cake is
made using a combination of Mexican chocolate, with its hint of cinnamon...Mr. Nish said his recipe originally came from Mr. 
Ducasses in Monte Carlo and he started making it two years ago when he as still at La Colombe d'Or. 'My sous-chef there, Mark May,
had worked with Ducasse,"...For his part, Mr. Ducasse said he started making the cake some five years ago, but did not invent
it. 'It reached a point where we were practically obliged to make it, but when it began showing up in every restaurant I took it 
off the menu."...Then there's Sarabeth Levine, the owner of Sarabeth's Kitchen, who said she was making little warm 
chocolate souffle cakes with deliciously moist centers years ago...Wolfgang Puck, the owner of Spago in Los Angeles, has been serving
a similar dessert, chocolate suprise cake, for a couple of months...At Mesa Grille in New York, Bobby Flay makes a similar
fallen souffle cake with a ganache center sharpened with a touch of ancho chili...Despite the variations and embellishments 
conceived by various chefs, the genesis might well be French home cooking as done by Mr. Vonerighten's mother...Mr. Payard of Le
Bernadin said it's really not any chef's recipe at all, but something everyone's mother makes at home in France..."<br>

Total time: 2 hours, including chilling
<p>
9 ounces bittersweet chocolate<br>
11 tablespoons unsalted butter plus soft butter for greasing molds<br>
3 tablespoons heavy cream<br>
2 tablespoons Jack Daniel's whiskey or other bourbon<br>
3 large eggs<br>
3 egg yolks<br>
1/2 cup sugar<br>
1/3 cup all-purpose flour<br>
Whipped cream or coffee ice cream

1. Melt 4 ounces of the chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Remove from heat and stir in 1 tablespoon
of the butter. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.<br> 
2. Combine cream and whisky in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, then pour over the melted chocolate. Stir with a wooden
spoon to combine. Place in the refrigerator and allow to cool, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is firm enough to
handle, about an hour. Using a melon baller or a teaspoon, quickly form the chocolate mixture into eight truffle-sized balls.
Place on a pan or plate lined with waxed paper and refrigerate.<br>
3. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter a muffin tin or tins with 8 cups that are each 4 inches in diameter, preferable of
 
1 cup capacity.<br>
4. Melt the remaining 5 ounces of chocolate and 10 tablespoons butter in the top of a double boiler over simmering water; stir and 
set aside.<br>
5. Beat the eggs, egg yolks and sugar together until the mixture thickens, triples in volume and forms a ribbon. Fold in the melted
chocolate. Sift the flour over the mixture and quickly fold it in.<br>
6. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared cups. Insert a chilled truffle in the center of each, place in the oven and
bake 12 minutes, until the top springs back when touched lightly. Do not insert a cake tester.
7. Unmold the cakes: run a knife around the edges, then place a baking sheet over the the tin and, holding both together, 
invert, 
then carefully lift off the muffin tin. Serve at once with whipped cream or ice cream.

<b>Chocolate Molten Volcano cookies?</b><p>
"Researchers at Nabisco Brands Inc. obtained a patent this week for a cookie that they say erupts like a volcano, spewing flavored filling out the tip and down the
 sides when it is heated in a microwave oven. Although goods baked in microwave ovens are now common, the new cookie appears to be the first to use the 
special properties of microwave energy to achieve an ornamental goal. The researchers said the product combined the convenience of a factory-baked cookie with
 the freshness and flavor of one just baked. Still experimental, the product is baked in a factory and features a hollow interior that is injected with a water-based 
filling. A consumer would heat the cookie in a microwave oven, causing the filing to expand and push upward through small openings in the cookie's top. The filling 
would then solidify as it trickled down the sides. Because microwave energy heats items form the center outward, the 'eruption' takes place without rebaking the 
cookie. Nabisco has not decided whether to commercialize the invention. Richard D. Fazzolare and Donald G. Boehm, Nabisco Researchers, obtained patent 
4,948,602."<br>

<b>A response from Texas</b><p>
"Researchers at Nabisco Brands Inc. have come up with an idea they think is novel: A cookie that erupts like a volcano, spewing filling out the top and down the 
sides when heated in a microwave oven The filling solidifies as it trickles down the sides, as if it were lava hardening on the sides of a volcano. They have even
 obtained a patent for this exploding cookie. I hate to inform the Nabisco researchers that this isn't a new and novel idea at all. Many times this same thing has 
happened to me while baking cakes, cookies and other goodies. I've had lots of things explode in my oven, trickling down the sides and solidifying and, believe me,
 I never thought about getting a patent to market the item. In fact, I never thought it was a pretty sight. Not only have things in my oven exploded. I've had perfectly
 innocent looking cakes create earthquakes. Not long ago I removed a cake from the oven, let it cool, and carefully frosted it. As I stepped back to admire it, the 
thing started shaking. I thought we were having an earthquake, but nothing else in the kitchen was moving. As I looked on in horror, the top layer of my cake split 
right down the middle and broke apart. There was nothing I could do by watch as several aftershocks hit, and the top pieces started sliding off the bottom layer. In 
just a few seconds, that cake shook itself into shambles. I thought it was terrible, but now I'm not so sure. If those people can get a patent and make millions for an 
exploding cookie, why can't I get a patent for an earthquake cake and make a few bucks? Look for it soon in your grocery store."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Chop Suey Cake</b></font><br>
Americans have been enamored with recipes titled "Chop Suey" from the early 20th century forwards. These "exotic" recipes 
presumably descend from Chinese culinary traditions. General notes on the origins of American-style 
<a href="foodasian.html#chopsuey">Chop Suey</a>.  
<P>
Is Chop Suey cake a Chinese-American recipe? Seriously not. Early 20th century American cooks ran with the name and applied to a variety of recipes (cakes, cookies, ice cream sundae toppings) 
featuring a variety of ingredients. The earliest print reference we find for Chop Suey Cake dates to 1912. General 
descriptions confirm it was a type of fruitcake, featuring traditional Anglo-American nuts and raisins. The earliest recipe we find for 
Chop Suey Cake from 1934. Curiously? It is a very simple cake devoid of nuts/raisins or anything identifiably exotic. In
 the late 1970s "modern" Chop Suey Cake first surfaces. Newspapers through out the country promoted one very different recipe: a 
cake with nuts and crushed pineapple with cream cheese frosting. We find no chef, company, or contest claiming to be the
 "inventor" of this particular Chop Suey cake.
<p>
This moniker reminds of of <a href="foodcakes.html#japanesefruitcake">
Japanese Fruit Cake</a>, epicentering in Appalachian America. No one offers an explanation for the "Japanese" part of the 
name. It is possible this moniker, like "Chop Suey" might indicate an exotic ingredient. In the case of Japanese Fruit 
Cake, this ingredient is coconut. In the case of (modern) Chop Suey Cake, this ingredient is pineapple.

<a name="coffeecake">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Coffee cake</b></font><br>
Coffee cake (also sometimes known as Kuchen or Gugelhupf) was not invented. It evolved...from
ancient honey cakes to simple <a href="foodcakes.html#galette">French galettes</a> to medieval fruitcakes to
sweet yeast rolls to <a href="foodcakes.html#danish">Danish</a>, cakes
made with coffee to mass-produced pre-packaged treats. 
<p>
Food historians generally agree the concept of coffee cake [eating sweet cakes with coffee] most
likely originated in Northern/Central Europe sometime in the 17th century. Why this place and
time? These countries were already known for their traditional for sweet yeast breads. 
When coffee was introduced to <a href="restaurants.html#coffee">Europe</a> these cakes were a natural
accompaniment. German, Dutch, and Scandinavian immigrants brought their coffee cake recipes
with them to America. 
<br>
The first coffee cake-type foods were more like bread than cake. They were enriched breads composed of
yeast, flour, eggs, sugar, nuts, dried fruit and sweet spices. <a href="foodcakes.html#streusel">Streusel</a> and crumb toppings were
not uncommon. Over time, coffee cake recipes
changed. Sugared fruit, cheese, yogurt and other creamy fillings (think: Danish) are often used in today's
American coffee cake recipes. 19th century American coffee cakes may surprise you. Coffee was an ingredient, not a 
serving suggestion. Some of these recipes were thrifty ways to use leftover coffee; others employed fresh brewed, or coffee extract. 
<p>
Early USA print references connecting coffee cake and coffee drinking are scant. One newspaper circa 1876 mentions dunking 
coffee cake in coffee. Cookbooks group the recipe in bread and/or cake
sections, depending on the formula. An early Philadelphia source mentions shaping coffee cake as pretzels, perhaps confirming a connection with
the Pennsylvania Dutch (German) heritage. World War I (aka The Great War) era cook books are the first to 
direct Americans to serve German Coffee Cake with coffee. By the 1920s "Coffee Cake" achieves distinct genre status, 
meriting seprate index headings and chapters.  
In 2013,
The Library of Congress "coffee cake" subject heading lists 9 books on the topic, from 1967 forwards.
<p>
<b>Where did the habit come from?</b><br>
"Much of the American appetite for sweet rolls and cakes comes from these specific Germans as
well as from the Holland settlements that had so much influence on early New York, New Jersey,
and Delaware. All of those colonial cooks made fruity, buttery breakfast or coffee cakes from
recipes that vary only slightly from methods used in the twentieth century. They also share some
of the responsibility for the national zest for doughnuts..."<br>
---<i>American Food: The Gastronomic Story</i>, Evan Jones, 2nd edition [Vintage Books:New
York] 1981 (p. 91)
<p>
"...Scandinavians were perhaps more responsible than anyone else for making America as
coffee-break-conscious as it is, and for perfecting the kind of food that goes well with coffee.
German women had already brough the Kaffeeklatcsh to their frontier communities, but it was in
the kitchens where there was always a pot brewing on the back of the stove that Scandinavian
hospitality and coffee became synonymous...The term coffee klatch became part of the language,
and its original meaning--a moment that combined gossip with coffee drinking--was changed to
define the American version of England's tea, a midmorning or midafternoon gathering at which
to imbibe and ingest....Like the cooks from Central Europe, most Scandinavian cooks have prided
themselves on simple forms of pastry making that include so called coffee breads, coffee cakes,
coffee rings, sweet rolls, and buns..."<br>
---ibid (p. 163)
<p>
According to the book <i>Listening to America</i>, Stuart Berg Flexner, it wasn't until 1879 that
the term "coffee cake" became a common term. Historic American cook books and newspapers support this claim.

Cream the butter and sugar, warm the molasses slightly, and berate these,w ith the spices hard, five minutes, until the mixture is very light. Next, put in the yolks, the coffee, and when these are well mixed, the flour, in turn with the whipped whites. Next, the saleratus, dissolved in hot water, and the fruit, all mixed together and dredged well with flour. Beat up very thoroughly, and bake in two loaves, or in small round tins. The flavor of this cake is peculiar, but to most palates very pleasant. Wrap in a thick cloth as soon as it is cold enough to put away without danger of 'sweating,' and shut within your cake box, as it soon loses the aroma of the coffee if exposed to the air."

"...[Coffee]...particuarly accompanied by a slice or two of German coffee cake. Sift 2 pounds of four into a large pan; 
make a hole in the center, into which break four eggs; add three cups of good potato sponge (set the night before) and a 
little new milk, warned. If it is cold weather, dip the eggs into hot water before breaking them. Make this into hard 
dough. Be careful and not put in too much milk, as you must use no more than 2 pounds of flour. Work it well; set it in a 
warm place to rise--not too lgiht. Then melt one-half or three-fourths pound of butter; one teacupful after it is melted
 is about enough, and work it into the dough with both hands. Keep at it until it is thorougly blended and very smooth. 
Work in one and one-half cups white suggar next; then as many raisins as you lie. (I use nearly one cupful). Use just a
 little flour to work it into a lump again, and set it to rise. When very light, turn the pan upside-down on the 
bread-board for the pupose of not disturbing the dough more than necessary in getting it out; then take a little piece at 
a time, enough when pulled out to half-inch thickness to sit into the baking tin. If the dough is not hard enoguh to roll,
 do not try to remedy it by adding flour, but take a piece from the dish to the pan and pat it down with your hand to the 
required thickness. When you have it all in tins, beat an egg, and with the pastry brush paint the cases all over; then 
dust sugar and cinnamon, mixed, over the top. Let it rise again very light, and bake in not a very hot oven fifteen 
minutes, or until they are a golden brown. Let tuem cook in the pans, then slice and dip into coffee before eating."<br>

"Coffee Cake</b><br>
1 pound of pastry flour<br>
1 tablespoon of sugar<br>
5 eggs (half pound)<ber>
4 tablespoonfuls (four ounces) of butter<br>
2 tablespoonfuls of milk<br>
1 compressed cake of yeast<br>
Dissolve the yeast cake in a quarter of a cup of warm water, and then stir in sufficient flour to make a dough. Knead this into a
small biscuit, and with a sharp knife make a cross almost through, and drop it, cut side up, in a good-sized pitcher, nearly filled with 
warm water. The bisuit will drop directly to the bottom, but in a few minutes the warmth and moisture of the water will cause the yeast plants to row, filling
the dough with carbon dioxid, which will make it sufficently light to float. While this is standing, sift the flour into a good-sized
bowl, make a hole or well in the centre, into which put the butter, sugar, milk, and eggs well beaten. Lift the biscuit with a skimmer and drop it in the mas.
Now with the two fingers and thumb work the ingredients to a paste, taking in gradually the flour. If the flour is of 
good quality, you will have a soft delicate dough, which can be manipulated lighly in the bowl. If it is sufficently dry to knead on the board, the cake will be 
coarse, and tasteless, and lack the delicacy necessary to this delightful cake. Cover the dough and stand in a warm place 
(75 degrees Fahr.) over night or from ten o'clock in the evening until seven o'clock in the morning. Dust the baking board very lightly with pastry flour;
turn out the dough, cut from the mass about two tablespoonfuls, and roll it out under your hand, the thickness of your little
vinger, and at least one and a half yards in length; make it a little thinner in the centre, fold the two ends together and roll the whole
under your hand, thoroughly twisting it rope-like. Bring the two ends of this roll together, and place the twists in a greased
pan, where they cannot touch each other in the baking. Cover and stand in a warm place until very light, about three quarters of an hour. 
Brush with the white of an egg and water beaten together, and bake in a quick oven (400 degrees Fahr.) for fifteen minutes. Take from the 
oven, and when they are slightly cold pour over each a little water icing, or melted sugar. Melted sugar is made by adding a tablepsoonful of hot
water to a half pound of powdered sugar. Stand this over the fire until it is just moist and sufficently soft to pour."

<b>Crumb cake & Streusel</b><br>
"Crumble is the name of a simple topping spread instead of pastry on fruit pies of the dish type
with no bottom crust, such as are popular in Britain. Recipes for crumble do not appear in old
books of English recipes, nor is it recorded until the 20th century. Crumble is much quicker and
easier to make than pastry and it seems probable that it developed during the Second World War.
It is like a sweet pastry made without water. The ingredients of a modern crumble are flour,
butter, and sugar; a little spice is sometimes added...The butter is cut into the dry ingredients, and
the mixture spooned onto the pie filling without further preparation...Crumble may have been
inspired by a similar cinnamon-flovoured topping traditional in Australia and Central Europe for a
rich tea bread or cake. The topping is called Streusel, and the cake Streuselkuchen (German
streusen, to scatter). Streusel contains much less flour in proportion to sugar than British crumble,
so that when baked it has a crisp and granular rather than crumbly texture, and remains firmly
attached to the top of the cake. It is spread over a coating of melted butter on the raw cake,
which helps it to adhere."<br>

<b>Galettes</b><br>
The history of bread and cake starts with Neolithic cooks and marches through time according to 
ingredient availability, advances in technology, economic conditions, socio-cultural influences,
legal rights (Medieval guilds), and evolving taste. Where does galette fit in? This is how the food
historians sum it up:
<p>
"Galette. In Fance, galette is a general term for a 'round flat cake'. And not just any sweet cake, etiher 
(although one of the best known is the traditional puff-pastry galette des Rois, 'Kings' cake,' baked on Twelfth night), The 
word is also used for thin fried cakes made from potato, or for pancakes. It comes from Old French galet, 'pebble'."<br>
---An A to Z of Food & Drink, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 136)
<p>  
  "Galette. A flat, round cake of variable size. The galette probably dates from the Neolithic
  era when thick cereal pastes were cooked by spreading them out on hot stones. In ancient
  times people made galettes from oats, wheat, rye and even barley, sweetened with honey.
  Then came the hearth cakes of the Middle Ages and all the regional varieties: the galette
  of Correze, made with walnuts or chestnuts; the galette of Roussillon, made with
  crystallized (candied) fruits; the marzipan galette of the Nivernais; the curd cheese galette
  of the Jura; the puff pastry galette of Normandy, filled with jam and fresh cream; the
  famous galette of Perugia, a delicate yeasted pastry, like brioche, flavoured with lemon
  rind (zest) and topped with butter and sugar; and, of course, the traditonal puff pastry
  Twelfth Night cake (galette des Rois or gateau des Rois). Galettes are not always sweet.
  In rural France galettes are traditionally made with potatoes (finely sliced or pureed) or
  with cereals (maize, millet, oats.)."<br>

  "Galette. A flat, round cake; the word being derived from galet, a pebble weatherworn to
  the shape that is perfect for skipping. Buckwheat or maize crepes are also called galettes
  in some regions...As a cake, a galette is made of flour, sugar, butter, and eggs in infinite
  variations, or simply of puff pastry. The glowing galette des rois [in Britain known as
  twelfth night cake] found in Paris, Lyons, and generally north of the Loire is fashioned
  almost exclusively from the latter, the classic feuillatage. The  kings' they honour are the

vast
numbers outside Denmark, and common alternative fillings include differently flavoured sugar and
butter
mixtures, almond or hazelnut mixtures, jam, creme patrissiere--alone or in any combination, often

"The Danish pastry (for Danish, as it is often abbreviated in American English) is a comparatively
recent introduction from continental patisserie; the first reference to it in English does not appear
until 1934. And the connection of this rich confection of yeast dough with Denmark is fairly
tenuous; it seems to have originated in Vienna, and the Austrians for some unexplained reason
associated it with Scandinavia. The Danes, paradoxically, refer to it as Wienerbrod--'Viennese

Although the

"The Danes call the pastry Vienna bread because when the Danish bakers went on
strike in the late nineteenth century, they were replaced by Viennese bakers who made
a light, flaky pastry dough. When the Danish bakers returned to work, they adopted the

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Lamingtons</b></font><br>
     Lamington cakes are connected with Australia circa early 20th century. There are two popular theories regarding
     the origin:
     <p>
     "Australia's most famous cake is said to have been named in honour of May, Baroness
     Lamington, wife of the Queensland governor from 1896 to 1901. There are two theories
     regarding its invention: one, that it originated in the Government House kitchens as a way
     of using up stale cake; or, the explanation favoured by the majority of commentators, that
     it was created by Brisbane cook Amy Schauer. Amy Schauer was born in Sydney in 1871
     and trained at the Sydney Technical College before taking up appointment at Brisbane's
     Central Technical College in 1895, where she continued to teach until 1937. She wrote
     three cookbooks...In addition, she developed cookery courses for school and technical
     colleges throughout Queensland, delivered classes in war and invalid cookery...In
     particular, she was famous for her talent in the area of confectionery, cake decorating and
     cake baking. Miss Schauer was undoubtedly the most influential figure in Queensland
     cookery during the first half of the twentieth century...There are several variations on the
     lamington theme, this classic being small squares of butter cake covered in chocolate
     icing and coconut but strawberry icing, cream fillings and larger cakes are also well liked.
     Often they are made with sponge cake but really the lamington butter cake makes the
     most flavourful ones."<br>

<p>
"Lamingtons. In 1896, Charles, the 2nd Baron Lamington, arrived in Queensland to take up his appointment as Governor...
Baron Lamington seemed to attract goodwill with his pleasant manner...The special little cakes, so prized by Australians in the early 1900s, are
popular still, came on to the Queensland food scene first shortly after Baron Lamington and his wife left Australia in 1901...
In the introductory pages of 'Mrs. MacLurcan's Cookery Book--A Collection of Practical Recipes Specially Suited for Australia by Hannah
MacLurcan,' Lady Lamington wrote a letter of thanks. It is dated April 16, 1898, and written from the Government House,
Brisbane. I have to thank you very much for sending me the copy of your most useful book of cookery, which I consider a particularly well
arranged work, as the recipes are so clearly given, with not too many details to bewilder the reader, and I think my Household will be
the better of having a copy. I wish the work all sucess...May Lamington.'<br>

     seem to be named after Baron Lamington, who was governor of Queensland from 1895

 with a boiled, fluffy white confection of water, sugar, and whipped egg whites. The cake is typically served in the South at birthdays, wedding anniversaries, and 
other special occasions. The recipe was first printed in Lane's cookbook Some Good Things to Eat, which she self-published in 1898. 
According to chef and culinary scholar Neil Ravenna, Lane first brought her cake recipe to public attention at a county fair in Columbus, Georgia, when she entered
 her cake in a baking competition there and took first prize. She originally named the cake the Prize cake, but an acquaintance convinced her to lend her own name
 to the dessert. Lane's recipe states that the cake should be baked in medium pie tins lined on the bottom with ungreased brown paper, rather than in cake pans. 
She specified "one wine-glass of good whiskey or brandy" for the filling and that the raisins be "seeded and finely clipped." She also insisted that the icing be tested 
with a clean spoon. In Lane's time, the cake would have been baked in a wood stove. Lane also suggested that the cake is best if made a day or so in advance of 
serving, presumably to allow the flavors to meld. Lane used the cake recipe as the basis for other cakes in her book, some frosted with orange or lemon cream. 
The Lane cake has been subjected to countless modifications and twists over the years. Coconut, dried fruit, and nuts are common additions to the filling described
 in the original recipe. Home bakers who wish to avoid the whiskey or brandy in the original recipe have substituted grape juice, especially for children's birthdays.
 Another common variation is to ice the entire cake with the filling mixture. The Lane cake is often confused with the Lady Baltimore cake, another fruit-filled,
 liquor-laced dessert with a different pedigree. 
In Alabama, and throughout the South, the presentation of an elegant, scratch-made, laborious Lane cake is a sign that a noteworthy life event is about to be 
celebrated. In the novel To Kill a Mockingbird, by Alabama native Harper Lee, character Maudie Atkinson bakes a Lane cake to welcome Aunt Alexandra 
when she comes to live with the Finch family. Noting the cake's alcoholic kick, the character Scout remarks, "Miss Maudie baked a Lane cake so loaded with 
shinny it made me tight." Shinny is a slang term for liquor."<br>

According to the <i>Dictionary of American Regional English</i> (p. 287), the oldest print reference to "Lane Cake" is from 1951:<br>
"Lane Cake. n. [Etym uncert, but see quot 1985] South, eps. AL, GA. A layer cake with a rich filling often including nuts, raisins, and brandy. 
1951. Brown. <i>Southern Cook Book</i> 249, Mrs. Merrill's Lane Cake--Four layers--many Southerners claim this famous Lane Cake, which 
is similar to the "Rocky Mountain Cake," made extensively in the Carolinas. The difference is in the filling. The Lane Cake has a rich egg-yolk
 filling with coconut, raisins, and nuts, while the filling for the Rocky Mountain Cake is generally white. it is said that this cake originated in 
Eufaula, Alabama...1985: WI Alumnus Letters, [Quoting <i> Chicago Tribune</i> article c. 1960;] Who really did invent Lane Cake and what is 
the original recipe? Emma Rylander Lane who lived in Clayton, Ala. wrote a cookbook called "A Few Good Things to Eat," published in 1898, 
which included Mrs. Lane's "prize recipe,"...Lane cake was served at holiday teas when guests came  visiting..." <br>
[NOTE: We do not (yet) have a copy of Mrs. Lane's cookbook. The earliest cook book recipe we have so far is from 1941. See below

<p>
Our survey of historic American newspapers and mainstream cookbooks reveals recipes titled "Lane Cake" commanded national attention in the
 1950s. Even then, recipes were few & far between. Why? Possibly because this cake contains an alcoholic kick.  Similarity in ingrediets and 
method suggests Lane Cake descended from popular 19th century White Mountain cakes. Popular period cakes containing alcohol were
 Fruitcakes (white & dark, brandy & other beverages added to batter & baked in cake. A Christmas holiday favorite) and 
Tipsy Cakes/Puddings (alcohol added after baking, to be soaked up in cake). Perhaps Mrs. Lane "married" the White Mountain (sponge) and
 the Tipsy (cream custard & alcohol) to enjoy the best of both recipes? This might also explain why Mrs. Lane instructed cooks to make this 
cake a day or two ahead for the flavors to mature. We wonder if the judges knew about this recipe's alcoholic content before they awarded it
 first prize.

<b>Lane Cake reference in Harper Lee's <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i><br>
Food historians trace the recipe for Lane Cake to 1898, although cakes with this actual name date in print only to 1951. Harper Lee, writing in 1959, would likely 
be familiar with this cake. So would most Americans at that time. While the recipe is period-correct in the 1930s, the name is not.

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Marble cake</b></font><br>
The first references we find to "marble cake" (light and dark cakes mixed to effect the marble
pattern) are from the last quarter of the 19th century. There are several variations on this theme.
Harlequin cakes (in checkerboard patterns) take this cake to the next level.
<p>
"The cookbook evidence suggests that Victorian American women served cake in the same basic
ways that their mothers and grandmothers had. For desserts, women generally baked cake in
square pans or "in sheets" and served it in cut squares on cake plates or in pierced-silver cake
baskets...Much grander party cakes were required for this new age, and they promptly
materialized. First was the marble cake, a logical extension of the American fascination with cake
color. When marble cake first appeared, its dark swirls were produced through the addition of
molasses, spice, and, in some recipes, raisins or currants. The simpler recipes were prepared using
a single whole-egg batter, half of it darkened, but more ambitious recipes produced a more
dramatic effect by making use of separate silver and gold batters, the latter darkened. Other
bicolored cakes soon entered the scene. Hard-money cake was made by swirling silver and gold
batters."<br>

"Straight to our kitchen from Mrs. Alcott's old home in New England came the receipt for
Marble Cake, and it was tested faithfully and given a place in Mother's collection of cakes suitable
for company, and extra nice for family fare. Mrs. Alcott herself made it on several occasions, with
Emily as helper and the rest of us, more or less, hanging over the mixing bowls and spoons.
Marble Cake was made in two parts, which was novel and interesting. One was light, the other
dark, and the batters were arranged in the baking pan by large spoonfuls, light and dark
alternating, and the cake was baked in a moderate oven about three quarters of an hour. Mrs.
Alcott confessed it was the one and only cake she could make successfully, as dressmaking was
her forte; but she was so neat-handed and skillful, and her Marble Cake was so delicious that we
decided she was entirely too humble. But here is her receipt:
<p>
<b>Marble Cake</b>
<br>
<b>Light Part</b><br>
1/2 cup butter<br>
1 1/2 cups sugar<br>
1/2 cup milk<br>
2 cups flour<br>
4 egg whites<br>
2 teaspoons baking powder<br>
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
<p>
<b>Dark Part</b><br>
1 cup brown sugar<br>
1/4 cup butter<br>
1/2 cup milk<br>
1 1/2 cups flour<br>
2 squares cooking chocolate<br>
4 egg yolks<br>
Dash of cinnamon<br>
1/4 teaspoon soda<br>
1 teaspoon baking powder<br>
1/2 teaspoon vanilla<br>

Each part of the cake was mixed separately, flour sifted with the leavening, butter and sugar
creamed, and so on. The chocolate was melted in a small saucepan set in a larger one of hot
water. When Mrs. Alcott became spooning the batters in the pan, first a spoonful or two of light,
then one of dark, it was quite exciting, but it was even more exciting when she took her loaves
from the oven, fragrant and delicious, and iced them. The operation went something like this: first
a thick white coating of frosting was applied evenly all over the top and sides, and the cake was
set aside to dry. Then she would drizzle melted chocolate all over it in streaks, in order further to
carry out the marble effect. At times, if the white icing had not entirely set, the chocolate would
blend into it in a very realistic way, which was greatly admired."<br>

<a name="pavlova">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Pavlova</b></font><br>
Both Australia and New Zealand claim Pavlova as their own. Which is correct? That's still a topic
of debate. Both sides agree that the cake was named after Anna Pavlova, a famous Russian
ballerina. Notes here:
<p>
"Pavlova, a type of meringue cake which has a soft marshmallow centre, achieved by the addition
of a little cornflour and teaspoonful or so of vinegar and teaspoonful or lemon juice to the
meringe mixture after the sugar is folded in...The pavlova has been described as Australia's
national dish, but it is also claimed by New Zealand. According to the Australian claim, it was
invented in 1935 by Herbert Sachse, an Australian chef, and named by Harry Narin of the
Esplanade Hotel, Perth, after Anna Pavlova, the Russian ballerina who visited both countries in
1926. The built-up sides of the pavlova are said to suggest a tutu. The Australian author Symons
concedes that the actual product had made a prior appearance in New Zealand, but suggests that
its naming was an Australian act. On the New Zealand side, however, Helen Leach has marshalled
evidence to show that: 
<p>
   *The name pavlova was being used in New Zealand as early as 1927, and the OED [Oxford
English Dictionary] points out, but that this use referred to a different dessert, whose connection
with New Zealand is anyway uncertain;   <br> 
  *the large soft-centered meringue cake which is the pavlova had been developed in New Zealand
by 1934 (or possibly earlier), although it was not at first called pavlova; but    <br>
   *the name and the dish were put together in New Zealand at some time before 1935, thus
antedating the Australian activity."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
585, 587)<br>
<b>[NOTE:</b> The Symons book referenced above is <i>One Continuous Picnic</i>, Michael
Symons [Penguin:Victoria] 1982 (p. 147-152).]
<p>
"It is a well-known fact, and source of heated nationalistic debate, that both Australia and New
Zeland lay claim to the invention of the pavlova cake. For over half a century, the dish bearing this
name has taken the form of a large, soft-centred meringue, usually topped with cream and fresh
fruit. The West Australian chef, Herbert Sachse, claimed to have invented it in 1935, a statement
whcih has been thoroughly researched by Michael Symons...New Zealand does not acknowledge
a single creator, but was certainly using the name pavlova and making large soft-centred
meringues before 1935. The New Zealand evidence is not straightforward, however, and in the
interests of historical accuracy (if not trans-Tasman relations), Symons' conclusion as set out
below, deserves some reconsideration:<blockquote>
"We can concede that New Zealanders discovered the delights of the large meringue with the
 marshmallow centre', the heart of the pavlova. But is seems reasonable to assume that someone
in Perth attached the name of the ballerina. As Bert Sachse implied, he distilled, or codified, a
widespread New Zealand idea, to which was added a catchy name, and all of this was legitimate,
common and like the crystallising of genius."</blockquote>
...Of course meringues are a European, not an Australasian invention...The <i>New Larousse
Gastronomique</i> attributes them to a Swiss pastry-cook, Gasparini, who invented the small
meringue in 1720 in the town of Mehrinyghen, but since the word meringue predates 1720
(<i>OED</i>), the origns of both word and food item clearly need further investigation. The
larger meringue cake may have been a nineteenth-century development....It is now clear that New
Zealand has won this particular contest, using the name pavlova by 1927, developing the large
soft-centred meringue by at least 1934, and putting the name and dish together at about the same
time, which was definately before 1935...The evolution of the modern pavlova from the 1920s
meringue cake required several transformations: <ul>
<li> a shift towards top decoration with cream and fruit, eventually replacing the layered filling;
<li> a change in egg white and sugar proportions and the intorduction of cournflour and vinegar,
to promote the soft centre;
<br> the abandonment of the tin in favor of cooking on greaseproof or baking paper alone.
</ul>
These changes occurred between 1927 and 1950. Simultaneously the name pavlova shifted in its
references from a moulded gelatine dish, to small coffee and walnut meringues, to the large
soft-centred meringue cake...A simplistic conclusion to this research would be to accuse the late
Mr.
Sachse of plagiarism. Since we now know that New Zealand cooks applied the name pavlova to
the soft-centred meringue cake before 1935, and since Michael Symons established the fact from
Sachse's wife that he read women's magazines which contained New Zealand recipe contributions,
the case for his creative  crystallising of genius' can be strongly challenged. In such a conclusion,
all the ingredients are present to stir up national outrage yet again, with the added spice of gender
exploitation, and of rivalry between professionals and amateurs...My preferred, more diplomatic
conclusion is that we are dealing with a case of convergent cultural evolution."<br>

<b>Pavlova origins [Australia]</b><br>
"The famous Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova toured Australia twice, the second time in 1929
including Perth in her itinerary. While there she stayed at the Esplanade Hotel, one of the leading
establishments in the city. Six years late in 1935 Elizabeth Paxton, owner of the hotel, requested
her chef create some delicacies to attract the ladies of Perth to the Esplanade for afternoon tea. So
it was that Herbert Sachse, born on the goldfields of Western Australia, failed wheat farmer
turned cook, came to invent the meringue cake which is now recognised as Australia's national
dessert. When the cake was presented, the hotel manager Harry Nairn declared that it was  as
"light as Pavlova," and the name stuck."<br>

"AN ELABORATE CAKE. Pavlova Cake. - There are several different varieties of Pavlova cake. The most elaborate consists of alternate layers of meringue, 
marshmallow, whipped cream and fruit filling, piled high to make the most luxurious party dish. A simpler Pavlova is as follows: Take the whites of six eggs, 10 table
 spoons 1A sugar, two teaspoons vine- gar and one teaspoon of vanilla essence. Beat whites very stiff, add sugar gently, then vinegar and essence. Have ready two
 shallow sandwich tins lined with greased paper, and pour mixture into each, sprinkling the tops with a little fine sugar. Allow to remain for two minutes, then place
 in a moderate oven and bake lightly till just colored. Take them out and scoop out some of the undercentre of each. Place back in the oven on a greased sheet of 
paper, just to dry a little, but do not let them stay long enough to color any more. Then take the round which is to be the bottom of the cake, and when cool, spread
 it thickly with whipped cream, flavored with a few drops of vanilla. Now cover with a layer of fruit (finely chopped peaches, strawberries or lemon, marshmallow
 or passion fruit filling, as desired). Add another layer of whipped cream, and set the other round on the top of the fillings. Decorate as desired. Marshmallow 
Filling.--Layers of delicious marshmallow will make an excellent addition to "Pavlova." Take lb. of 1A sugar, 1 cups of water, 1oz. of powdered gelatine, small 
half tea- spoonful of tartaric acid, 2 whites of eggs and essence of vanilla, to taste. Soak the gelatine in half a cup of water, boil the sugar and the rest of the water 
until a little tested in cold water forms a Soft ball. Add the gelatine and acid, boil for a few minutes. Take off and stand till quite cold and on the point of setting. Beat
 till thick and white, add stiffly-beaten whites of eggs and essence, and beat again. Pour on to a plate or sandwich tin to thickness required, and when set, transfer to
 the cake. Delicious sweets can be made by cutting the marshmallow into little squares and dusting them with icing sugar." <br>

The history of pineapple upside-down cake is an educated guess for most food historians.
Culinary evidence (cookbooks & magazines published in the United States) confirms <a href="foodcakes.html#pineapples">pineapple</a>
was a readily available and very popular ingredient in the 1920s. This also happens to coincide
with the popularity of the maraschino cherry. Details here:

"Pineapple upside-down cake<br>
Food historians agree that pineapple upside-down cake belongs to the twentieth century but are
not so certain about the decade. According to John Mariani's (<i>The Dictionary of American
Food
and Drink</i>, Revised Edition, 1994), "The first mention in print of such a cake was in 1930,
and
was so listed in the 1936 Sears Roebuck catalog, but the cake is somewhat older." In
<i>Fashionable
Food: Seven Decades of Food Fads</i> (1995), Sylvia Lovegren traces pineapple upside-down
cake
to a 1924 Seattle fund-raising cookbook...While rooting around in old women's magazines I
found a Gold Medal Flour ad with a full-page, four-color picture of Pineapple Upside-Down
Cake--a round cake with six slices of pineapple, candied red cherries, and a brown sugar glaze.
The date: November 1925."<br>

"Who invented Pineapple Upside-Down Cake? Suzanne Vadnais of Camarillo recently sent me
some information from the Internet on this question.  One of America's classic desserts has an
interesting tale behind it, but the question is not totally answered yet. Some turn-of-the-century
cookbooks have recipes for fruit upside-down cakes made with apples and cherries. Early recipes
were made in skillets, probably cast iron, and cooked on top of the stove, since settlers did not
have ovens. These were known as skillet cakes. Even the 1943 "Joy of Cooking" has a recipe for
a skillet version of upside-down cake. In 1925, the Hawaiian Pineapple Company (later Dole) ran
an ad in several women's magazines for creative and original recipes using pineapple. An
Upside-Down Cake from Mrs. Robert Davis of Norfolk, Va., was published in the cookbook of
prize winners. But before we credit her with the original recipe, it turns out that 2,500 recipes for
pineapple upside-down cake were submitted to the contest! Obviously the idea was not new, but
the contest gave the recipe widespread publicity.<p>
     Another version holds that James Dole made up a cake using his canned pineapple. That still
leaves a gap in the story in my mind. How did 2,500 people get the recipe to submit it to the
contest? Maybe food historians will continue to search for the missing link. James Dole certainly
had a great influence with his pineapple canning business, for without canned pineapple we
probably never would have had pineapple upside-down cake!"<br>

We have a booklet published by the Dole Pineapple Company in 1927 entitled <i>The Kingdom
That Grew Out of a Little Boy's Garden</i>, Marion Mason Hale. It contains many recipes but
none
for pineapple upside down cake. The closest looking recipe is called "Dutch Hawaiian Pineapple
Cake" (p. 43) which features pineapple on the top of a cake, garnished with a cherry. The
instructions tell the cook to put the pineapples on TOP of the cake just before cooking.

<b>A survey of early recipes:</b>

<p>
<b>[1925]</b><br>
"'Upside-Down Cakes'. Many recipes for the cake inquired about by our correspondent in Query No. 4498 have been received, and gratefully
acknowledged. We give another typical recipe and some important comments as follows:<br>
A heavy iron frying pan, from eight to ten inches in diameter, is recommended, and some of our friends make the cake in an earthen
baking dish. Heat the pan quite hot, then add three tablespoonfuls of butter, and when melted tilt the pan to run the butter all 
over the sides. Add one cup of brown sugar, and cook until smooth and bubbling all over. Next add one small can of shredded 
pineapple, the juice drained off. Instead of pineapple you may use prunes, steamed and stoned, or half-and-half fruit and chopped
nuts, or marshmallows; or you may use maraschino cherries, or any kind of preserved fruit. Now reduce the temperature, and pour over
all a cake batter, made of two cups of flour, one-half a cup of butter, one cup of sugar, three eggs, beaten separately, one-half a teaspoonful
of salt, with any flavoring you wish, and milk, water, or fruti juice--or all three mixed-- to make a thick batter. Bake forty-five minutes in a 
slow oven, let stand in pan for ten minutes after removing from oven, then run a knife round the edge, and turn out on a cake plate, 
when the cake should appear to be already frosted. Some of our friends use one-half a cup of butter, instead of three tablespoonfuls,
to cook in pan with the brown sugar, and then pour over a sponge-cake mixture, or a cake made of two eggs, one cup of sugar, one cup and
hone-half of flour, one teaspoonful of baking powder, one-half a teaspoonful of salt, and one-half a cup of hot milk. Some use 
maple syrup instead of brown sugar, and cook the syrup longer. Some eat the cake hot, some let it cool, and eat it with or
without blanketing with whipped cream. This cake is variously named Pineapple Cake, Pineapple or Apricot Torte, Caramel Pudding, 
Frying Pan Cake, Skillet Cake, Griddle Cake, Pineapple Glace, Different Pudding, Chesterfield Pie; but Skillet or Upside-Down 
Cake are the commonest names. The recipe originally was given to the mother of one of our friends by a famous Belgian general. 
The danger points are in the first cooking of the sugar, which must not be overdone, or the frosting will be bitter; and in the baking
of the cake, to keep the bottom from burning."<br>
---"Queries & Answers," <i>American Cookery</i>, June/July 1925 (p. 56)
<p>
There seems to be no particular appropriateness in calling a sponge cake with slices of pineapple caramelized on the bottom of the it an upside down cake, but
 that is one of the names given it. Another name, one given it by the teachers of commercial cookery, is Hawaiian pie, which she says is a little different from 
ordinary cake. A short-handed frying pan with its thick bottom is good for this variation of a sponge cake. As for the cake, any sponge cake recipe you have, and 
that you find successful, will do. If it is one calling for water you may use pineapple juice instead. First the cook in question makes a sirup for the utensil on which 
the cake is to be baked of one cup of brown sugar and four tablespoons of water, cooking until they look like a lot of medium-sized pearls in the pan, and then 
adding to them five slices of pineapple, and finally the cake batter, a three-egg batter baked for 35 minutes in a 400 degree oven. A vital point is that this cake 
should be turned out of the pan the instant it is taken out of the oven, otherwise the pineapple and the cake will separate. When the cake is cool, whipped cream
 may be spread or mounted on it, and then the eater gets a surprise when he cuts down and finds the pineapple. Different sorts of syrups are used in preparing the 
pan, and the pineapple is sometimes cut and fitted in fancifully. <br>

<b>"Caramel fruit sponge</b> is merely our old acquaintance, upside down cake, which is sometimes known by the unattractive name of 
skillet cake, under a new name. It is made by turning the batter, for which a sponge cake formula is usually used, over some sort of 
fruit and baking it in an iron frying pan or skillet. For this time of year I suggest fresh peaches, which are pared and sliced. A generous
quantity of butter is melted in the frying pan, a cup of brown sugar added and when it is melted the fruit placed in it; I say placed because
the fruit is to form the top of the cake when it is turned out of the pan, and therefore we must keep in mind the neceissty for an
attractive appearance."<br>

"Up Side Down Cake</b><br>
It isn't often that we find a cake that can be made in the same tin with its frosting in a frying pan. Take 1 1-2 cups brown
sugar, melt in an iron or aluminum frying pan. When bubbling and smooth, cover the bottom of the skillet with slices of pineapple.
Be careful not to allow the mixture of sugar and butter to carmelize too much as that would make the frosting bitter. Pour over the 
pineapple mixture the cake batter and bake in a rather hot over about 450 degrees for five minutes, then reduce the heat to about
350 degrees. Bake until done and a light brown crust has formed over the top about 30 minutes in all. The cake may be turned out of
the pan right side up to show the nice brown crust or upside down to show the selfmade caramel pineapple icing, cut in squares
or approximate circles to follow the line and serve with whipped cream or just plain. The cake batter is made as follows:<br>
1 1/2 cups sugar<br>
1-2 cup pineapple juice<br>
1 1/2 cups flour<br>
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br>
1/4 teaspoon salt<br>
1/2 teaspoonful vanilla<br>
Separate the eggs, beat the yolk until a ligth yellow, add sugar and pineapple juice, flour mixed and sifted with the baking powder
and salt vanilla and lastly the lightly beaten whites."<br>

"Upside Down Cakes in General. These cakes have a short history. The first time I heard of them [1921] I thought the cake a
sort of cobbler with a breadlike base. Since that date they have been called spider cakes, skillet cakes, etc., and many sorts of 
fruits have been used for them, including prunes. Soem people prefer halves of canned apricots, the open side up when the cake is
finished, as having more flavor than canned pineapple, bu there is littel doubt the original cake had the pineapple, great rings
of it, on the top of the cake when it was inverted. The first cakes were really sponge cakes with a pineapple garnish, and a correspondent
told me they probably originated from the 'Gail Hamilton Pan Pie,' which I mean to hunt for some day. This correspondent used
apricots, a sponge cake batter, and did the unusual thing of leaving it in the pan until ready to serve it, when she heated it over
the flame to make it come out easily and then covered the cake with whipped cream. But other people, myself included, have though ti rather
vital to turn the cake out the instant it was taken from the oven, for otherwise the fruit will separate from a sponge cake. I have
not tried it with a butter cake batter, which many people seem to prefer. The first business consists of melting three or four 
tablepsoons of butter in a frying pan, and then of melting in this a half cup of sugar--if the pan is large enough. Frying pans 
vary so in size and flare, etc., that it is difficult to give an exact recipe. At any rate, a large one is needed for a three egg
sponge cake when the expert puts it together, although this will have much less bulk if not expertly beaten. When a good cup cake--two
egg cake--is given full expansion in the making it, too, will make enough for a large pan. Patterning the Pineapple Garnish. If
slices of pineapple are cut in long, thin triangles and fitted around the bottom of a frying pan--a short handled one with a metal
handle--and exceedingly pretty effect, or fruit fram for the broad low cake to be baked in, can be made, but it takes a little 
patience and an 'eye.' A stiff and awkward effect is not worth spending the time over. Better do what so many people do, put a can 
of crushed pineapple [drained] into the pan with the sugar and butter. Typical Upside Down Cake. <i>American Cookery</i>, two
years ago, after gathering a great many recipes for thsi cake, wrote as follows: 'We give another typical recipe and some important

<b>ABOUT PINEAPPLES</b><p>
<b>Why do we call this fruit a pineapple?</b>
<p>
"When the Spaniards first reached the West Indies they found the Indians cultivating the luscious fruit which the natives called anana. But the Dons, 
struck by its resemblance to a giant pine-cone in form, christened the new fruit <i>pina</i> which the English translated into 'pine'
and, to distinguish the fruit from the evergreen tree, they added 'apple'."<br>
---<i>Foods America Gave the World</i>, A. Hyatt Verrill [L.C. Page & Company:Boston] 1937 (p. 120)
<p>
<b>Where did pineapples originate?</b><br>
"The pineapple grows best in hot humid climates, as it was originally from Brazil and Paraguay and was later distributed over the South
American continent by the Tupi-Guarani tribes as they expanded their territory. By the time of the European conquest it was known in the 
West Indies, Mexico, and the Maya area, as well as South America."<br>

"The Incans and pre-Incans knew the fruit, and cultivated it in the warm valleys and on the lowlands near the coast, for pineapples are frequently
represented on the ancient pottery vessels found in the mounds and cemetaries of Peru."<br>

<p>
<b>Global diffusion</b><br>
"A native of the New World, the pineapple (Ananas comosus) is now cultivated in frost-free areas around the world. The Tupi-Guarani
Indians of South America have been credited with its domestication, although this is in some dispute. It would seem, however,
that the origins of the pineapple are definately in lowland South America. The earliest written references to the fruit were made by
Spanish chroniclers, including Christopher Columbus, who is alleged to have naemd the fruit, calling it the  'pine of the Indies' because
of its resemblance ot a pinecone. It is still called <i>pina</i> in Spanish today, whereas the Portuguese word for 'pinapple,'
 <i>ananas</i> (also part of the scientific name) derives from an Indian term for the fuit. After their discovery, pineapples were used to 
provision ships and spread from the Americas by two routes: One was across the Pacific in Spain's Manila galleons to the 
Philippines and from there to China; the second was in Portuguese ships from Brazil to Africa and beyond to India. Before the end of the 
sixteenth century, pineapple cultivation had spread across much of the tropical world, and the plant had found its way to some of the Pacific Islands. In the
late eighteenth century, pineapples were introduced to Hawaii..."<br>

<b>Pineapples in North America</b><br>
"The earliest known [English] reference to the presence of a pineapple in North America comes
from William Strachey. One of hundreds of brave or deluded men willing to sail into all but the
unknown where the climate was harsh, the resources limited and the natives unfriendly, Strachly
arrived in Jamestown in 1609 and was soon appointed secretary of Virginia. He had heard tell of a
 'dainty' and  'nice' fruit that looked a little like a pinecone...As more and more ships arrived, there
were undoubtedly repeated attempts to naturalize the pineapple...The fact was that Virginia and
the surrounding area simply did not suit it. To consent to grow outside its natural habitat, the
pineapple demands time, attention and a finely tuned climate and soil. In the American colonies it
experienced none of these...Nonetheless, it managed to maintain an imaginative presence thought
the many reports of what it was  said to be'...It was not long before the struggle for survival in
the American colonies receded to such a degree that the great planters could at last, with
sufficient time and funds, concentrate on attaining the stylish living so exalted in England...As one
of the most prevalent decorative forms in the age in England, it is no wonder that the first
pineapples to find a role within American cultural life were those made of stone, silver, wood or
porcelain...Preserved pineapple eaten as a sweetmeat had been available in the colonies for some
time...it was not long before fresh pineapple in all its luscious and exotic reality also became an
option for those so long starved of treats--albeit only for the very richest. Pineapple has featured
in cargoes coming north from the Caribbean (in particlar the Bahamas) since the beginning of the
[18th] century, but it was not unitl the 1750s that they began arriving all through the summer
months at ports along the east coast from New York to Charleston and everywhere in between.
One day in the summer of 1752...the <i>Virginia Gazette</i> announced the arrival in
Williamsburg port of seen dozen pineapples from New Providence in the Bahamas...Local grocers
stocked imported fruit--if you had the ready cash..."<br>

<b>19th century pineapple trade proliferates</b><br>
"The speed of the clipper ships was reflected in their high freight rates, which meant they carried
only luxury goods, high priced enough to be able to absorb the cost...and also destined them to
transport perishable cargoes, mostly food--fruit from the Mediterranean, spices from Indonesia,
wheat from Australia...In the East, as the speed of coastwise vessels increased, the danger of
foods decaying en route diminished, and the North could call upon the produce of the South...by
the 1850s ships from Florida were delivering fruits and vegetables there [New York City] twice a
month; and by the middle of the century pineapples and coconuts were arriving from Cuba, from
other West Indian islands, and even from Central America."<br>

<b>Hawaiian pineapples</b><br>
"The pineapple was introduced to Hawaii by Captain James Cook in 1790, but it was not
commercially cultivated there because of the difficulty of shipping between the islands and the
United States. Throughout the nineteenth century the fruit was a rarity for most Americans, even
though it was grown in Florida. In the 1880s, however, widespread cultivation was encouraged in
Hawaii with the onset of the steamship trade in the Pacific, and in 1903 James Drummond Dole
began canning the pineapple at Wahiawa for shipment everywhere. Dole's Hawaiian Pineapple
Company had by 1921 established the fruit as the largest crop in those islands...The most popular
variety there is the 'Smooth Cayenne', followed by the 'Red Spanish'. Americans eat pineaple
fresh, as part of a salad or fruit cocktail, in sherbets, ice cream, and ices, in gelatin, in cocktails,
and as a flavoring, including in cordials. Canned varieties include sliced rings, chunks, and crushed
pieces. Pineapple juice is extremely popular and often used in mixed drinks like the Mai Tai and
Pina Colada. Dishes made with pineapple are often called 'Hawaiian style'."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New
York] 1999 (p. 242-3) 
<p>
"The major American pineapple industry started in Hawaii. Pineapples had
appeared in Hawaii well before it became a U.S. territory in 1898. Plantations grew pineapples
that were shipped to West Coast American cities, but this was expensive. Canning in Hawaii
began in 1885 but was of little importance until Jim Dole founded the Hawaiian Pineapple
Company in 1901...The vast increase in supply created the need to expand the market, and
pineapple growers encouraged publication of pineapple recipes, which soon appeared in cookery
magazines and cookbooks." <br>

<a name="pineapplesymbolism">
<b>Why are pineapples regarded as symbols of hospitality & friendship?</b>
<p>
"Perhaps because it was such a highly esteemd fruit...the Indians adopted the pineapple as the symbol of friendship and
hospitality, the Europeans soon learned that if they came upon an Indian hut or village with pineapples or pineapple tops
placed beside the entrance, they would be welcomed and received hospitably...the idea of the pineapple-symbol of friendship took the
fancy of the romantic-minded Dons who carried it back to Spain. From Spain the custom spread to England, and from Britain the
colonists carried it to Virginia and New England, and wherever they built their homes they placed carved or painted
pineapples beside or above the entrances to indicate that visiotrs could be assured of a friendly welcome."<br>
---<i>Foods America Gave The World</i> (p. 120-121)
<p>
"When the people of the Old World did learn of pineapples, they
recognized some of the same symbolism the people of South America and the Caribbean lands
recognized. The pineapple symbolized friendship and hospitality to the Caribs. These people often
hung pineapples ouside their huts as a kind of welcome mat, inviting people to visit. But in
Europe, other factors also came into play. Because pineapples were difficult to cultivate in
European soil, the fruit quickly became and expensive product. Europeans began to associate
pineapples with nobility because only the rich could afford them. Interestingly, the pinecones of
the Holy Land also served as symbols of nobility...In Europe, the pineapple remained a symbol
of hospitality and friendship, just as the nobility stood for hospitality and friendship as well as
wealth and privilege. The link people recognized between pineapples and hospitality led to the use
of pineapples as an architectural motif. Images of pineapples adorned entrance halls and dining

Trendy cooks in late 19th century America were fascinated with creating foods with interesting colorful patterns. Among the most popular items were cakes, 
candies, cookies, sandwiches and ice cream. These recipes were often distinguished by the term "harlequin" or "neapolitan" in the title. 20th century cooks
 continued to experiment. Before long, they created what is known today as the "checkerboard effect." As expected, recipes for Checkerboard Cake are all over 
the culinary map. Different colors, various flavors, scratch cakes, box mixes, special pans, and generic kitchenware all vie for attention on this particular cake stand.

eight level teaspoonfuls of baking powder, one-half a cupful of ground chocolate, one and one-half teaspoonfuls of salt, the yolks of three eggs, the whites of six
 eggs, two teaspoonfuls of lemon juice and two cupfuls of water. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt together, sifting them three times, sifting the flour once 
before it is measured. Cream the butter and sugar together, adding the sugar a little at a time and creaming well. Add alternately with the water to the creamed
 shortening and sugar, add the lemon juice and three tablespoons of vanilla extract. Divide the mixture into two equal parts, mix the chocolate with one-third of a

Cheesecake is a food rich in history, culture, tradition and ceremony. It is not the invention of a
single person but a result of culinary evolution. The origins of cheesecake are grounded in ancient
agricultural practice, tempered by local resources, and tweaked by technological advancement. In
short, cheesecake is a perfectly good example of the dedicated human quest for good tasting food.
The English, French, and Germans
developed their own recipes, according to cultural taste and period technology. Cheeseless cheesecakes (sweet, rich custard pies) began to appear in English cookbooks in the
17th century. <a href="foodpies.html#chess">Chess pie</a>, a popular Southern American
favorite,  is descended from these. 
What kind of <a href="foodcakes.html#cheese">cheese</a> is used for cheesecake?
<p>
<b>Ancient Roman cheesecake</b><br>
"Libum means  cake'. What kind of cake? It is often talked of by Roman poets, but what they say
does not always match Cato's recipe. Libum was sometimes a sacrificial cake such as was offered
to household sprirts in the early years of Roman history; it was sometimes a farmhouse cake,
served hot; it as sometimes a delicate honey cake that was served at the very end of an elaborate
Roman dinner...All the ancient writers associate Libum with honey--all except Cato, and he is the
only one who actually gives a recipe...Cato's libum is a delicious savoury cheesecake, very
successful when served hot. The cheese that is used can be quite salty and mature...and the
resulting texture, with golden-brown crust and soft centre, is similar to that of a modern baked
cheesecake. If, on the other hand, we take it that the proper thing was to add honey, a soft
unsalted cheese must be chosen: the combination of salty cheese and honey is unappetising."<br>

<b>Cato's Placenta (layerd cheesecake)</b><br>
"Placenta to be made thus: 2 lbs. bread-wheat flour to make the base; 4 lb. flour and 2 lb. prime emmer groats to make the
layers. Turn the emmer into water; when it is realy soft put it in a clean mixing bowl and drain well; then knead it with your hands, and
when it is well worked add the 4 lb. flour gradually, and make into sheets; arrange them in a basket to dry out. When they are dry 
rearrange them neatly. In making each sheet, when you have kneaded them, press them with a cloth soaked in oil, wipe them round and
damp them. When they are made, heat up your cooking fire and your crock. The mostine the 2 lb. flour and knead it; from this you make a
thin base. Put in water 14 lb. sheep's cheese, not sour, quite fresh; let it steep, changing the water three times; take it out and
squeeze it gradually dry with the hands; when properly dry put it in a mixing bowl. When all the cheese is properly dried out, in a 
clean mixing bowl knead it with the hands, breaking it down as much as possible. Then take a clean flour sieve and press the cheese thorugh the
sieve into the mixing bowl. The add 4 1/2 lb. good honey and mix it well with the cheese. Then put the base on a clean table which gives a foot 
of space, with oiled bay leaves under it, and make the palcenta. First place a single sheet over the whole base, then, oen by one, spread the sheets 
[with mixture] from the mortar and add them, spreading them in such a way that you eventually use all of the cheese and hone, and on the
top put one more sheet by itself. Then draw up [the edges of] the base, having previously stoked up the fire; then place the
placenta to cook, cover it with the heated crock, and put hot coals around and above it. Be sure to cook it well and slowly. Open it to check on it 
two or three times. When it is cooked, remove it and coat with hone. This makes a one-gallon placenta."<br>

<a name="philadelphia"><b>Philadelphia cheesecake</b><br>
Primary sources reveal cooking methods relating to early Phildadelphia-area cheesecakes.
<p>
"The German element was an influential one in Philadelphia well into the latter half of the 19th
century. In many areas of food production, such as bread and biscuit baking, the manufacture of
chocolate and mustard, butchering, and tavernkeeping, the Germans reigned supreme. However,
love of cheesecake was shared by both English and German-speaking Phildadelphians, and early in
the 18th century, this love became something of a local cult at the Cheesecake House. Situated on
the west side of 4th Street, on grounds extending from Cherry Street to Apple Tree Alley, the
Cheesecake House stood in the middle of a pleasure garden shaded by cherry and apple
trees...Even in 1848, nearly a century after it had disappeared, the Cheesecake House was still
fondly remembered in the Sunday Dispatch."<br>

<a name="newyork"><b>New York Cheese cake</b><br>
The history of "New York Style" cheesecake begins with upstate New York creameries which
developed a unique <a href="foodcakes.html#nycreamcheese">American type cream cheese</a>. What makes it New York cheesecake?
<p>
"Say Cheesecake<br>
Q. I've heard that the recipe for cheesecake, that classic New York dessert, came here from Italy.
A friend insists that it
was "invented" here at the turn of the century. Care to get mixed up in this?
<p>
A. You're both at least partly correct. New York cheesecake, the kind made famous this century
in restaurants like
Reuben's, Lindy's and Junior's, is considered by some to be a dense, sweet, creamy adaptation of
traditional Italian cakes
made with curd or cottage cheese. Recipes for coarser, less sweet ricotta cakes like the Tuscan
crostata di ricotta and the
Neapolitan pastiera have been around for centuries, according to Matt Sartwell, a resident scholar
at the Kitchen Arts
and Letters store in Manhattan. In fact, the writings of Cato the Elder, the Roman statesman and
moralist of the second
century B.C., include a recipe for "savillum," a relatively simple honeyed ricotta cheesecake. But
it wasn't until about
1872 that cheesecake baking as we know it in New York become practical and popular, according
to "Cheesecake
Madness" by John J. Segreto (1996, Biscuit Books). That was when William Lawrence of
Chester, N.Y., accidentally
developed a method of producing cream cheese while trying to duplicate the French Neufchatel.
Soon after, a dairyman
living in South Edmeston, N.Y., produced a particularly silky version for the Empire Cheese
Company, which was later
sold under the brand name Philadelphia Cream Cheese. "The New York-style cheesecake that we
know depended on the
development of this cheese," Mr. Sartwell said. He added that the graham cracker crust, another
American innovation,
would have been impossible before the cracker was introduced early this century."<br>
---"Say Cheesecake," Daniel B. Schneider, <i>New York Times</i>, September 21, 1997 (p.
CY2)
<p>
"Many nineteenth-century American cookery books do include recipes for cheesecake, beginning,
as often as not, with the curdling of the milk with rennet. But the silky, cream-cheese cheesecake
is something else again, a turn-of-the-century arriviste introduced, for the most part, by Jewish
delicatessens in New York City. [Merle] Evans even traces the beginning of "the New York
cheesecake saga" to the 1920s and attributes it to "an enterprising delicatessen owner, Arnold
Reuben [who] opened a restaruant on 58th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues" at that
time. Soon Reuben had rivals, among them Leonard's...Juniors...Lindy's, a Broadway
restaurant...According to Molly O'Neill...the smooth, rich cheesecake served at Lindy's in the
1940s became the quintessential "New York Cheesecake," the one by which all others are
judged."<br>
---<i>The American Century Cookbook</i>, Jean Anderson [Clarkson Potter:New York] 1997
(p. 390)
<p>
"What we mean when we say cheesecake
In the case of New York Cheesecake, an Eastern-European-style cake made from pot and cream
cheeses was claimed as the city's own...Early versions of the cake were probably heavy. In Bronx
Primitive, her memoir of growing up in the Bronx, Kate Simon recalls the "cementlike
cheesecakes" that her mother made on Fridays. The confection moved from homes to resturants.
By 1940, cheesecake was the main call at Lindy's, the fabled theater-district restaurant that actors
and actresses jammed for late-night dessert. The Guys & Dolls razzle-dazzle that surrounds
Lindy's cheesecake may not be the only reason that Lindy's became synonomous with New York
cheesecake. Between homes like the Simon's and restaurants like Lindy's, Eastern European cake
experienced an unbeatable lightness of being. The recipe for Lindy's smooth cake has appeared in
numerous cookbooks..."<br>

<b>When we think <a href="foodcakes.html#newyork">New York style cheese cake</a>, we think Lindy's.</b> The restaurant, like its clientele,

clearing house of news of Broadway, the theater, Tin Pan Alley, the radio world, and Hollywood. Gefeulte fish is delish. Sturgeon
 and smoke salmon are sandwiched salubriously. Steaks are noble, and Lindy cheese cake a headliner. The shutting down of the bar at 
4 a.m. goes unnoticed by the gabbers consuming coffee and cake till ejected at 5 a.am. Smaller Lindy's closes at 3 a.m.. Both
open at noon."<br>

<p>
<b>Want to make a genuine Lindy's Cheese cake?</b><br>
Recipes for Lindy's cheese cake are easy to obtain. There are several versions. 
Did Lindy's really release this recipe at one time? We think so, evidenced
by the fact is was published by Duncan Hines in the 1930s. At that time, Mr. Hines was famous for recommending restaurants
to travelers. His book, <i>Adventures in Food Cooking</i>, offered dozens of dishes from "America's Favorite Eating Places."
It was an honor to have a recipe included in this book. We think Hine's version is the real deal. In <i>Duncan Hines Food Odyssey</i> (c. 1952), the author relates
his personal encounter with Lindy:
<p>
"As I write this, gold is worth somewhere around thirty-two dollars an ounce. Lindy's cheese cake at forty-five cents a slice is
somewhat less expensive, yet a good many people who've eaten at Lindy's famous Broadway restaurant consider it pure gold...There are more items
on Lindy's two menus (one for luncheon, one for dinner) than on any menu I can recall...If your taste runs to the Jewish
delicacies for which Lindy's is famous, order one of the items printed in capital letters, such as LINDY'S SPECIAL CHEESE
CAKE.These dishes are the specialties of the houe, the items on which Lindy prides homself. That 'SPECIAL' must be a typographical
error, for Lindy himself calls it simply Lindy's cheese cake. He doesn't see anything special about it. It may be the finest in New
York and the most famous in the world, but that's not enough to make it special to Lindy. it is simply the only cheese cake that he
make, and that's that...Lindy is more completely surrounded by his work than any restaurant man I've known. His office is a big
icebox in the basement. Each morning he sits down at a tale there, surrounded by shelves full of wine, cheeses, and cartons of cigarettes, to 
telephone his orders and hold conferences with his staff." (p. 47-48)

"When Lindy's restaurant in Manhattan closed its doors--and ovens--in September, 1969, it was the end of a legend in more ways
than one. It was fabled for its sturgeon, corned beef and blintzes. But most of all it was renowned for its cheesecakes, which were
as integral a part of Gotham culture as Yankee Stadium, Coney Island, Grant's Tomb and the Staten Island Ferry. Approximately 20
years abot, shortly before his death, I approached Leo Lindemann, the owner of the establishment, and pleaded with him to let me have the
recipe for his cheesecake. I was rewarded with a rather wan, benign and tolearant smile as though I had demanded the Kohinoor 
diamond. Presumably the recipe for the cheesecake had disappeared from the face of the earth, but I know have what is purported to
be that recipe. It was offered me by Guy Pascal,the distinguished pastry chef at La Cote Basque restaurant who, tomorrow will open
what promises to be one of the finest pastry shops in Manhattan, the Delixe La Cote Basque, 1032 Lexington Avenue (between
73rd and 74th Streets). How Mr. Pascal came into possession of the recipe is a six-month study in intrigue, subterfuge and
deception in and around the sugar bins and flour barrels of a Las Vegas kitchen. The Case of the Purloined Recipe began when the
young chef opened a small pastry shop in the kingdom of casinos 10 years and longer ago. 'One day,' Mr. Pascal said, 'an old man came to ask
for a job, and among his other credentials he told me that he had spent years in New York preparing the cheescake at Lindy's. At
that time I'd never heard of Lindy's cheesecake, and I hired him in spite of the fact. Well, he started to make his dessert and my
business started to boom; people were standing in line. I was fascinated at the appeal of the cake. So much so, I offered him money
for the recipe. He refused and I offered him more. He still refused...'For weeks I didn't mention the cake. When he worked
 he was pretty furtive in assembling his ingredients. But I kept a strict account of the number of cakes he produced balanced 
against the amount of cream cheese we purchased. I have very good peripheral vision, and out of the corner of my eye as the weeks
passed I figured out the quantity of orange peel he used, how much lemon peel. the number of eggs and so on. And after six months
I had it perfected.' The result is being printed here and, as far as we know, it is the first time the real recipe--or a reasonable
 approximation of it--is being published...<br>
<b>Lindy's Recipe?</b><br>
Butter<br>
1/2 cup fine cake crumbs or graham cracker curmbs<br>
2 lemons<br>
1 orange<br>
1 1/2 pounds cream cheese<br>
1 teaspoon vanilla<br>
1/2 cup heavy cream<br>
3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar<br>
4 large eggs<br>
2 tablespoons sour cream<br>
1/4 cup half-and-half cream<br>
1. Preheat to oven to 375 degrees.<br>
2. Generously butter and 8-by-2-inch round cake pan. Sprinkle the inside with the crumbs, then shak out excess crumbs.<br>
3. Grate the lemons and orange. Set the grated rind aside. Use the lemons and orange for another purpose.<br>
4. Add the cream cheese to the bowl of an electric mixer. Add the grated rind and vanilla, beating. Gradually add the
heavy cream and sugar, beating constantly on moderate speed. The important thing to avoid in making this recipe is beating on 
very high speed. This wouldd incorporate air into the cheesecake and make the cake rise like a souffle. Add the eggs, one at a time, 
beating well after each addition.<br>
5. Beat in the sour cream and half-and-half.<br>
6. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and smooth the surface. Set the pan in a larger pan and pour boiling water around
it. Place in the oven and bake one and one-quarter hours until the center does not quiver when the pan is shaken. Remove from
 water bath and let stand on a rack about 10 minutes. Invert and unmold while hot. Let stand until cool.<br>
Yield: 8 to 12 servings<br>
Note: Crumbs can be made from any day-old cake such as pound cake or genoise."

<b>What kind of cheese goes into cheesecake?</b> That depends upon the period, people and place. The common culianry theme
is creaminess. <a href="foodcakes.html#creamcheese">Cream cheese</a> is most prevalent. In modern times, <a href="foodcakes.html#curds">curdy</a> cheeses (ricotta,
marscapone, cottage cheese) are regularly employed.
<p>
<b>When did humans begin consuming cheese?</b><br>
"...Cheese actually dates back to the earliest domestication of animals, at about 9000BC and it
had been made wherever animals produced more milk than people use in fluid
form....Archaeologists have established that cheese was well known to the Sumerians (4000BC),
whose cuneiform tablets contain references to cheese, as do the Egyptian and Chaldean artifacts.
It is as much a staple of the Old Testament as honey and almonds and wine, and is associated with
stories of great daring...The Greeks were so fond of cheese that they rewarded their children with
it as we give ours candy--and "little cheese" was a special term of endearment. Their Olympic
athletes also trained on a diet consisting mostly of cheese....and the island of Samos was noted
for cheese-cakes, for which Athenaeus even gives us a recipe: "Take some cheese and pound it,
put in a brazen sieve and strain it, then add honey and flour made from spring wheat and heat the
whole together into one mass." Wedding cakes of that early era were almost invariably
cheesecakes, and at Argos it was customary for the bride to bring little cakes that were roasted,
covered with honey, and served to the bridegroom's friends."<br>
---<i>The Cheese Book</i>, Vivienne Marquis & Patricia Haskell [Leslie Frewin:London] 1966
(pages 18-19).
<p>
"Every market in Greece sold cheeses to those who could not make their own, and by the fourth
century BC the popular fresh white Greek cheeses were being flavored with herbs and spices and
baked into all manner of cakes and pies...The Roman Empire used cheese a great deal in
cooking....Cato mentions a sauce based on salt which was used to preserve cheese and gives the
recipe for a celebration wedding cake, in which the main ingredient was cheese, spiced and
flavoured with grape must, fat, aniseed and bay leaves; this was also baked on top of bay leaves
which impaired their agreeable aroma to the concoction....Apicus, the foremost Roman
gastronome, included a very elaborate dish among his recipes, served cold, in which the cheese
was blended with honey, peppermint, watermelon, vinegar and many other ingredients."<br>

"Curds were still incorporated in certain cooked dishes which had survived from medieval times.
The spiced cheese tarts of that period were continued in tarts of curds which were still known a
cheesecakes in the seventeenth century...Fresh curds formed the basis of the filling, supported by
eggs, spices and sometimes currants. By the middle of the century, some cheesecake recipes
contained neither cheese nor curds, but instead a rich custardy mixture of eggs, butter, flour and
unrenneted cream, duly sweetened and spiced....A further development a few decades later was
the lemon cheesecake. Its filling consisted of pounded lemon peel, egg yolks, sugar and
butter...Orange cheesecakes were made in similar fashion, from the skins of Seville oranges which
were first boiled in two or three waters to take off their bitterness."<br>

<b>What is cream cheese?</b><br>
Cream cheese is a complicated topic. According to the food historians, soft, fresh country cheese
(cream
cheese, cottage cheese, ricotta, farmer's cheese, Neufchatel) were probably the first cheeses
known to
man. Soft cheese were enjoyed by Ancient Romans and Greeks. Creamier cheese were produced
and
perfected by European countries, most notable France. Medieval cookery books contain several
recipes
which include soft cheese both savory and sweet. When cheesemakers immigrated to the United
States,
they brought their craft with them. Food historians generally agree that cream cheese, as we
Americans
know it today, was first manufactured in <a href="foodcakes.html#nycreamcheese">upstate New York</a> in
the latter half
of the 19th century. There is, however, evidence suggesting cream cheese was manufactred earlier
in the
Philadelphia area (1861/D. Bassett Co.).
<p>
"Those curds and whey Miss Muffet was addressing herself to before the arrival of her uninvited
guest were,
of course, the sixteenth century forerunner of our cottage cheese. Even at that time, however, it
had a
venerable history, for although its origins are obscure, there is little doubt that this sour and
separated milk--curds and whey--was the beginning of what we now call cheese...In piecing
together the story of how fresh
cheeses were first made, it seems likely that early nomadic tribesmen, wandering with their flocks,
must at
times have had a good deal of sour milk to dispose of. After using what they could, they were
faced
inevitably with the choice of throwing the rest away or carrying it with them--a hard decision for
poor people
who had to keep moving to keep alive. At some point or other--some say about 9,000 years
ago--these
wanderers appear to have realized that milk, like meat, could be more easily preserved and
transported if it
could somehow be dried. Eventually they hit upon two ways of doing this. One, probably the first,
involved
the process of evaporation: they put fresh milk into shallow earthenware unensils and exposed it
to the heat
of the sun. The milk first turned sour and then began to evaporate. The result was a semi-dry acid
curd
characteristic of the fermented milk preparation we know today as yoghurt. This was also
probably the
primitive beginnings of cream cheese, for the first cream cheeses were--and some are
today--simply dried
cream...In any event, the simplest way to make a cream cheese...it is pour heavy cream into a
perforated
box lined with two loose layers of cheesecloth. In about four days, the cream's superflous
moisture will have
evaporated or drained away, leaving a firm but spreadable cheese...Many variations of pot cheese
and
cream cheese can be found in every country that makes cheese...Even India, which makes
practically no
cheese, has a kind of cottage cheese called Surti and a cream cheese called Surtal. The list is
endless..."<br>

cream; a

"Up to the eighteenth century a great deal of cheese was eaten in Europe, and especially France.
The
people of high rank developed a sweet tooth. Sweet desserts became so popular that the only kind
of
cheese considered elegant was cream cheese heavily sweetened and flavoured with perfumed oils.
Rove
sheep's milk cheese sprinkled with orange-flower water is still a specialty of Marseilles. Eaten in

"'Cream cheese although so called, is not properly cheese, but is nothing more than cream dried
sufficiently to be cut with a knife' Thus Mrs. Beeton in in 1861. Her comment was pertinent in
that the
simplest form of cream cheese is made by draining cream through a muslin and leaving it for a few
days
until it becomes as firm as butter. But what is normally offered as cream cheese is produced in a
more
sophisticated manner, and is rarely made from cream alone. Most kinds of cream cheese are made
from a
mixture of cream and milk, inoculated with lactic acid-producing bacteria chosen to produce the
desired
degree of acidity. The mixture may or may not need rennet to precipitate the curd. Although the
bacteria are
allowed some time in which to do their work, a cream cheese is not matured...The most important
cream
cheese, in terms of quality, must be Philadelphia cream cheese; it has long been the principal
American
variety, and cream cheeses are said to account for a quarter of all cheese eaten in the USA.
Well-known
French cream cheese include...Fontainbleu, Boursin, Brillat-Savarin, and Explorateur...The
Scottish caboc,
known since the 15th century, was Sir Walter Scott's favorite kind of cheese. It became extinct
but had been
revived as a rich cream cheese, made from double cream and given a crust of toasted pinhead
oatmeal."<br>

<b>Philadelphia & New York: American cream cheese capitols</b><br>
"William A. Lawrence was in the creamery business in Chester [New York, Monroe County] in
1872 when he entered the cream cheese business...'Legend among the old timers of Chester is
that Mr. Green and his cheese making friend were discussing the recipe...and Mr. Lawrence came
into the barn, heard them talking, stopped and listened throught a knot-hole in the wall. Heard the
recipe given by the Swiss man, and promptly went home and made cream cheese.'...The American
product known as cream cheese was made in the manner of Neufchatel, with extra cream added
to the mixture. Mr. Lawrence labeled his product Philadelphia cream cheese (not to be confused
with Philadelphia Brand cream cheese) because he sent it to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to be
packaged a shipped to his buyers. Early production amounted to only a few pounds each day.
Made in cylinders of about two and three-quarters by one a half inches, the cheeses were rolled in
tissue paper and padded with straw for shipping in empty boxes obtained from grocers...Cream
cheese production in Central New York began around 1880 at the Crystal Palace Factory in
McDonough, R. Johnston and Co. In Afton, and the Empire in South Edmeston. The region was
known for fine dairy herds...The high quality cream cheese packed under the label of the
"Philadelphia Brand" was made at South Edmeston for nearly one hundred years...The origin of
the "Philadelphia Brand" has been the subject of countless debates between legislators as well as
cheese makers and local residents who remember the heyday of its manufacture in their valley.
Although the word "Philadelphia" was included in the name of the cream cheese made in Chester
about 1872 and in Philadelphia, New York, in the 1880s, this brand name was legally established
for the cheese made in the Empire Factory in South Edmeston. It signified that the cheese was of
the traditional high quality of foods produced in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."<br>

According to the records of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (http://www.uspto.gov)
Kraft's
Philadelphia Brand cream cheese was first used in commerce September 1, 1880 (registration
#0392212).
<p>
"Kraft company records place the invention of cream cheese in the hands of a New York
Dairyman named
William A. Lawrence, who first experimented with it and saw potential in the mixture he
fashioned from milk
and cream in 1872; he called the product Star Brand. The cream cheese became so popular that
other
dairies in the New York area began manufacturing a smimlar product. In 1880 a cheese
distributor named
C.D. Reynolds forged a deal with Lawrence for the latter to supply a steady flow of cream cheese.
At the
same time, Reynolds purchased another cream cheese production facility, the Empire Cheese
Company of
South Edmeston, New York. The name "Philadelphia" was adopted for the product because the
Pennsylvania city was treasured as the seat of high-quality foods, particularly dairy products...In
1924 J.L.
Kraft & Bros. Co., which had produced and provided processed cheese to the U.S. government
armed
forces in World War I, went public as Kraft Cheese Company and entered the cream cheese
market. Four
years later, Kraft merged with Phenix [Cheese Company], continuing the production of
Philadelphia Brand
cream cheese and introducing new products like Velveeta pasteurized process cheese
spread...Compared
to Camembert and other rich, soft cheese of Europe, Philadelphia Brand cream cheese was
originally
made in U.S. locations that could easily provide production plants with fresh milk and
cream...Because of
several patented adjustments to the production process in the mid-1940s, the life span of the
cheese
jumped from an original couple of weeks to about four months...Central to Kraft's success at

There are plenty of Web sites offering brief histories of wedding cake, many citing to ancient
Roman rituals [crumbling cake on the bride's head], medieval customs [piling cakes to signify
good luck and wealth], 17th century improvements [an unkown French chef is often said to have
iced the conglomeration of heretofore medieval cake offerings and created the first true
wedding cake]. Are these stories true? According to <i>Wedding Cakes and Cultural History</i>
by Simon R. Charsley, most of this information was created in the Victorian era in to satisfy late
19th century cultural demands. It is not documented fact. <a
href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.1525/gfc.2005.5.2.69?uid=3739808&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21101928566083">Wedding Cake:

<p>
"The Victorian myth of origin<br>
The degree to which the wedding cake and the uses to which it is put in twentieth century Britain
have become standardized may well mislead when the past is considered. Even the degree of
standardisation already present in the later nineteenth century misled J. C. Jeaffreson whose
<i>Brides and Bridals</i> [1872] offered a pioneering account of the history of the cake. Other
writers have subsequently followed him, sometimes themselves adding to the confusion by
misinterpreting his words in terms of the cakes with which they were familiar in their own
day...<br>
...Jeaffreson's  history  is...an interesting example of the myth-making of its period. Like
others...he was led by a sense that, to be properly grounded, contemporary practice must have a
lineage going back to ancient Rome. This was to make a link with the region of history so special
for the identity of European societies as they developed out of the middle ages as to be labelled
 classical'. At times and amongst people aware of their own imperial status, such links were at a
premium...The story Jeaffreson told began, therefore, with an ancient Roman marriage practice
involving the breaking of a cake over the bride's head. It jumped to evidence from the England
of a thousand and more years later, for the pouring or throwing of grain, and from this to
supposed survivals around Britain as late as his own century of the breaking of biscuit,  'cake' or
 bread' over the bride...<br>
...It was, Jeaffreson considered, with the arrival in England of French confectionery skills and
influences at the Restoration in 1660 that the pile of cakes was consolidated with an overall
covering of icing and decoration....There is no doubt that this story is fanciful and wrong, though
its subsequent repetition shows that he had created a myth which would appear appropriate to
those few who have thought to question the cake's origins."<br>

cakes in several cultures. It is well documented and contains an extensive bibliography for further

<p>
<b>Does this mean cake was not served at weddings before Victorian times? Of course
not!</b><br> 
Across all eras, cultures and cuisines, the very finest foods are traditionally saved for the most
important celebrations. Weddings are considered quintessential human affirmations of the
continuing march of human life. In ancient times, it was quite possible that honey and other sweet
cakes might have been served as part of the wedding feast. Medieval wedding feasts typically
included fine cakes and puddings made with dried fruit. Traditional European holiday <a
href="christmasfood.html#plumpudding">fruitcakes</a> and <a
href="christmasfood.html#plumpudding">plum
puddings</a> descended from this tradition. These confections, however, did not assume the
elevated position of today's wedding cake. It has been suggested by some food historians the
ritual of wedding cake may derive from religious practices. In Christian religions, the sharing of
bread-type products (communion) signifies committment. Some other religions have similar
traditions.
<p>
"In the medieval period neither cakes in the usual modern sense nor icing had yet appeared.
Nothing directly equivalent to the wedding cake could thereforh have any part in the celebration
of marriages. Feasts and celebations might be held but marriage was simply their occasion. No
specialized food object had a place at them, not was there as far as has been recorded any special
action of a ritual nature using any food item as part of the wedding. Medieval feasting is
nevertheless one of the roots from which cakes and their use in weddings were to
grow....Decoratively presented foods and those using imported ingredients of high cost were
features of medieval feasting. Dishes, often combining both, were developed in the highest
reaches of society where the wealth for their creation was available and display was an important
prop to status and power..."<br>

<p>
<b>About cake-breaking traditions in the British Isles</b><br>
"...one ancient custom continued unabated. This was the strewing of grain over the bride's head, though by the eighteenth century the wheat of tradition was likely to have 
been joined or replaced by comfits. These sugar-coated nuts and seeds became a universal feature of weddings throughout Europe from the 
Renaissance onwards...Closely related to the strewing of wheat or comfits was the custom of breaking a cake over the bride's head...No evidence for the breaking of cake 
over the bride's head exists from the Tudor period, and it is not until the time of Herrick that we hear of it at all. Herrick's verse, with its constant use of antique poetical
 forms and classical allusions, does not necessarily reflect the actual folk practices of his day. His wassails, wakes and hock carts could just have easily taken place in
 Arcadia as in rural England. Aubrey mentions the practice in passing and makes a point by linking it with the ancient Roman custom. Eighteenth-century accounts of
 bride-cake breaking are rather scant, or are in the context of fictional acounts and therefore not reliable. However, there are a number of trustworthy reports of the practice
 from nineteenth-century folklorists, all from northern England or Scotland. The Reverend Willian Carr, a local historian from Craven in Yorkshire, cites one of the most
 interesting: 'The bridal party, after leaving the church, repair to a neighborouring inn, where a thin currant-cake, marked in squares, though not entirely cut through, is 
ready against the bride's arrival. Over her head is spread a clean linen napkin, the bride-groom standing behind the bride, breaks the cake over her head, which is thrown
 over her and scrambled for by the attendants.' A variation of this procedure is reported from the Scottish Borders, through a piece of shortbread rather than a currant 
hearthcake is used to scatter on the bride's head. 'As the newly-married wife enters her new home on returning from the kirk, one of the oldest inhabitants of the 
neighbourhood who has been stationed on the threshold, throws a plate of short-bread over her head, so that it falls outside. A scramble ensues, for it is deemed very 
fortunate to get a piece of the short-bread, and dreams of sweethearts attend its being placed under the pillow.' This particular rite of passage, which took place on the 
threshold of the house, ir reminiscent of the widespread train- and comfit-throwing practices of other European countries."<br>

"There are always problems in inferring social practice from fiction. While authors necessarily produce texts from their own culture and time, they are more likely to 
present events that are in some way unusual, and therefore interesting to themselves and to their expected readers, than they are to describe the entirely usual. Here, 
clear evidence is provided that ideas of cake-breaking were around in the late eighteenth century, but the important implications are otherwise negative. It can be inferred
 from this account that no such practice was either general amongst likely readers of the book or even regarded as having been general in the recent past. nor was anything
 of the kind thought to be in any way essential. There is however other sporadic evidence of such practices from England at the perood...and from Scotland the evidence 
may even suggest something more generalised. The earliest Scottish report  is not indeed of bread or cake of any kind, but the analogy is clear: at the beginning of the
 eighteenth century, Lady Grisell Baillie bought in Edinburg for her daughters; marriage ribbon 'for the Garland that is brock over the Birds head', as well as 'Confections
 Plumcaks and Bisket from Mrs Fenton'...It is tempting to see this as a modification, suitable for gentry who had already joined the plum cake class, of an earlier, more
 earthy cake-breaking. Smollett's reference to 'ancient Britons' may draw similarly on Scottish experience... It is tempting ot imagine that it was from his youth there that 
he remembered the cake-breaking which he now called into his narrative. Certainly, for soon after Smolette was writing, cake-breaking is directly documented...In parts of 
Scotland an oatcake or shortbread might be broken over the head of a bride as she entered a house after the marriage. This was often her entry into the groom's house 
where she would henceforth be living (as was indeed implied by Herrick's poem), but Gregor, a folklore researcher in the north-east of Scotland whose testimony has already
 been quoted, suggests a wider range of possibilties. It might be an oatmeal cake that was broken over her head. 'In later times a thin cake of "short-bread", called the 
bride-cake substituted for the oatmeal cake. It was distributed among the guests, who carefully preserved it, particularly the unmarried, who placed it below their pillows
 to "cream on".'."<br>
---<i>Wedding Cakes and Cultural History</i>, Simon R. Charsley [Routledge:London] 1992 (p. 104-105)
<p>
"...the term "bridecake" does not simply refer to the special status of the cake baked for the wedding feast, but rather it alluded more specifically to the practice of breaking the 
cake over the bride's head. In Ireland, this custom was well established in a band of counties running from County Louth on the east coast to County Sligo on the west. It was also
widespread in County Galway. It was not, however, unique to Ireland and the practice is well attested in England and Scotland. many Irish accounts indicate that the cake was broken
over the bride as she entered her new home, a point ot transition symbolizing her imminent role as the first woman of the house...In contrast to these procedures, the cake was often
broken after the wedding feast as the bride sat at the table, or stood amongst the gathered assembly. Alternatively, the cake might be broken by attendant guests who then threw
bits at the bride, a variation that is highly reminiscent of the custom of throwing wheat, rice or confetti, suggesting that the practice may have been bound up wtih the question of 
fertility. However, those informants who could remember witnessing or hearing of this ritual understood that it was enacted with the wish that the bride would not want or go hungry.
If the cake was broken over the bride's head, slices or pieces were often distributed to the guests; but if the cake were crumbled for throwing, this was not an option. instead, young,
unmarried girls, who subsequently saved them to dream upon, eagerly seized upon the crumbs that fell to the floor. The understanding was that such creams would reveal the
identity of their future husbands."<br>

During the 17th-18th centuries, both the English and Americans feasted on "great cakes,"
sometimes called "bride's cakes" or "bride's pies" as the event required. These special cakes were
also not unlike traditional fruitcake. Our notes on <a

feasts</a> include authentic 18th century British and American  recipes for wedding cakes.
<p><blockquote>
<b>19th century wedding cakes:</b><p>
<p>
<b>[1833]<br>
"Wedding Cake</b><br>
Good common wedding cake may be made thus: Four pounds of flour,
three pounds of butter, three pounds of sugar, four pounds of currants, two pounds of raisins,
twenty-four eggs, half a pint of brandy, or lemon-brandy, one ounce of mace, and three nutmegs.
A little molasses makes it dark colored, which is desirable. Half a pound of citron improves it; but
it is not necessary. To be baked two hours and a half, or three hours. After the oven is cleared, it
is well to shut the door for eight or ten minutes, to let the violence of the heat subside, before
cake or bread is put in. To make icing for your wedding cake, beat the whites of eggs to an entire
froth, and to each egg add five teaspoonfuls of sifted loaf sugar, gradually; beat it a great while.
Put it on when your cake is hot, or cold, as is most convenient. It will dry in a warm room, as
short distance from a gentle fire, or in a warm oven."<br>
---<i>The American Frugal Housewife</i>, Mrs. Child, Boston [1833] (p. 72)
<p>
<b>[1845]<br>
"Wedding Cake, No. 1.</b><br>
Four pounds of flour, four pounds of sugar, three of butter, forty eggs, five pounds of stoned
raisins, three pounds of currants, on e ounce of mace, half an ounce of nutmeg, six tea-spoonfuls
of rose-water, four teas-spoonfuls of cream of tartar, stirred in the flour, two tea-spoonfuls of
saleratus well dissolved. Beat the butter and sugar to a cream; beat the yolks and whites separate,
add the flour gradually, then the spice and saleratus. Bake it two hours and a half."
<p><b>"Wedding Cake No. 2.</b><br>
Four pounds of flour, three pounds of butter, three pounds of sugar, four pounds of currants, two

half or three hours."
<p>
<b>Wedding Cake, No. 3</b><br>
Four pounds of flour, three pounds of butter, four pounds of sugar, thirty eggs, three and a half
pounds of currants, one pound of citron, one ounce of mace, a little cinnamon, very little cloves;
make it into loaves of convenient size. Bake it two and a half or three hours."<p>
<b>Frosting for Cake, No. 1</b><br>
Beat the whites of eggs to an entire froth, and to each egg add five teas-spponfuls sifted loaf
sugar, gradually; beat it a great while. Put it on when your cake is hot or cold, as is most
convenient. A little lemon juice squeezed into the egg and sugar, improves it. Spread it on with a
knife, and smooth it over with a soft brush, like a shaving brush."
<p>
<b>Frosting for Cake, No. 2</b><br>
Three and a half pounds of loaf sugar, the whites of twelve eggs, lemon juice, and a little potato
starch."<br>

<b>Very Rich Wedding Cake</b><br>
Take four pounds of fine flour, four pounds of fresh butter; sift two pounds of powdered sugar, and grate to it quarter of an 
ounces of nutmeg; break eight eggs (yolks and whites separately) for each pound of flour; wash and pick four pounds of 
currants, and dry them before the fire; crush the butter between the hands until it is reduced to a cream, then beat it up
with the sugar for fifteen minutes; beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and mix with butter and sugar; beat the yolks half
an hour, and mix them in; put in the flour and nutmeg, and beat it up; pour in a pint of brandy, and add a quantity to taste of
citron cut in strips; pour it into the baking-tin, and when it has risen and browned, cover with paper, lest it should burn.

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>German Sweet Chocolate Cake</b></font><br>
Food historians generally place German Sweet Chocolate Cake (aka German Chocolate Cake) in 1957 Texas. The "German" part of
 this cake is "German's Sweet Chocolate," a popular period General Foods product. So, by the way? Was Baker's brand coconut , 
traditionally incorporated in this cake's icing. Ultimate corporate market coup? Arguably, eventually, yes. But probably not at first. 
Both GF products were well known to USA home cooks in the 1950s. Economical, delcious and trendy. Combinations were 
interesting and endless. German Sweet Chocoate Cake with Bakers coconut frosting was inevitable.
<p>
Our survey of USA newspapers confirms German Sweet Chocolate Cake recipes were circulating in states other than Texas in 
early 1956. 
Texas-style German's Sweet Chocolate Cake were actively promoted in 1957 by County Home Demonstration Clubs. 
Recipe variations debated number of layers (2,3,loaf?), type of nuts (pecans, walnuts, unspecified) and
filling vs icing. Local newspapers proudly printed local cook names offering up recipes. None of these people claimed to be 
the "inventor." All of them refer (vaguely?) to having learned this recipe from a contemporary friend.
<p>
Bogus information? We think not. When things hit a perfect popular storm, they go "viral." We think: if German Chocolate Cake was introduced today it
would be Tweeted, FaceBooked, YouTubed and Blogged. Fact we've uncovered recipes from 1956 in places other than Texas
doesn't change the original impact or nostalgic ramifications. Fact today's researchers are now gifted with online primary
 sources does always automatically challenge contemporary wisdom. The beat goes on.
<p>
<b>Traditional food history:</b><br>
"German's Sweet Chocolate cake. A cake made with Baker's German's Sweet
Chocolate and topped with a coconut-pecan frosting. The original recipe, when first
submitted to a Dallas newspaper in 1957 by a reader, caused the sale of Baker's
German's Sweet Chocolate (a trademark of the General Foods Company) to soar in
Texas. A General Foods district manager brought the recipe to the attention of the
company, and the recipe was perfected and promoted throughout the United States.
The recipe has become so widespread over so many decades that it is often called
"German chocolate cake," and many believe the cake is of German origins, and,
because of the inclusions of pecans and buttermilk, a specialty of Texas bakers. But in
fact the name of the chocolate derives from Dr. James Baker, who in 1780 financed the
first chocolate factory in America. His descendant, Walter Baker, hired and employee
named Samuel German, who developed a "sweet chocolate," which as added to the
Baker's line under German's name. A similar cake, apparently newer and adapted from
German's Sweet Chocolate cake, is the "Texas sheet cake" (also "Texas cake"),
because it is baked in a large baking pan and not set in layers."<br>

<p>
"German Sweet Chocolate Cake...A wholly twentieth-century cake, a "reader recipe," the story
goes, that was printed in a Dallas newspaper in 1957. That Texas food editor, Julie Bennell,
clearly had an eye for the unusual...for this cake contained a quarter of a pound of sweet
chocolate. German's Sweet Chocolate was specified, a smooth bittersweet blend named after
Samuel German, the Walter Baker & Company employee who'd formulated it in 1852. Though
German's sweet chocolate always sold well enough, it didn't take off until 15 years later. And
then mostly in Texas. The sudden run on German's mystified the General Foods district manager
until he traced it to the newspaper recipe. According to Betty Watson (Cooks, Gluttons, and
Gourmets, 1962), he asked Julie Bennell, the Dallas food editor, if he might send the recipe to
other food editors around the country. And when it appeared elsewhere, reader letters avalanched
in. Writes Wason, "A St. Louis homemaker wrote to her paper saying it was like meeting a long-lost friend; her mother-in-law had given her this recipe thirty years before when she was a gride
and she somehow lost it." Before long, home economists at General Foods headquarters...refined
the recipe, adding another company product: Angel Flake Coconut, Idea men rechristened it
German Sweet Chocolate Cake and beginning in 1958, had it printed on the wrapper of every bar
of German's Sweet Chocolate."<br>

[Clarkson Potter:New York] 1997 (p. 454)
<p>
<i>The New York Times</i> "confirmed" the story:<br>
"It started in Texas when one housewife lent another her special recipe for chocolate cake. Within a short time, the same
recipe had been pased throughout the Southwest. A cafeteria in St. Louis added the cake to its menu with a great
success. About that time, General Foods noted that sales of one of its products, Baker's German sweet chocolate, had increased
tremendously in the Southwest. The product had been around for a long time--in fact, since Samuel German introduced it in 1852. 
But distribution had been limited in recent years and sales unimpressive. The southwestern representative for General Foods did some
detecting and found that the Baker product was an ingredient in the increasingly-popular chocolate cake, hence the rise
in sales. He managed to get a copy of the recipe, although he was not able to trace the circuitious route back to the Texas woman
who originated it."<br>

Groom's cake seems to be relatively modern tradition that probably originated in the Southern
United States sometime in the 19th Century. The traditional cake ingredients and folklore are
reflect ancient Wedding cake customs; current recipes and serving ideas reflect modern wedding
tastes. 
<p>
"Already in the 1890s, therefore, a choice of cakes had been established in America. The types
could be played with, for commercial and/or symbolic effect. One idea was to give the bridegroom
a cake to match the bride's, and this might be simply achieved by renaming the rich fruit style. A
'Lady Cake or Plain Bridegroom Cake'  for which the recipe was published in "The British Baker"
in 1897 as an importation from 'across the herring pond'...was, however, a white cake.
The author explains that it is 'supposed to be cut by the bridegroom and distributed with a glass of
wine to the bridesmaids before going to church'. In Britain neither practice nor cake met with any
success, but in the United States the two cakes did persist, with the light cake usually being
associated with the bride, the dark with the groom. From the mid-century a possible combination
of the two has been described from Virginia. The bride's would be on the bottom..."<br>

"Cake historians say the [grooms cake] practice first came to the wedding party in the mid-19th
century. About that time the bride's cake--for a long time a single-tier, dense fruitcake--had
evolved into a stacked pound cake in the shape of a church steeple. But revelers still desired some
of the old-style, rich, fruity cake. Enter: the Bridegroom's Cake. Each guest was given a slice of
fruitcake in a box to take home. As the story goes, single women who slipped a slice under their
pillow would have sweet dreams of a mate. Today, groom's cakes are baked and iced in the
bridegroom's favorite flavors...A groom's cake is a have-to-have in the deep South."<br>

"The grooms cake...The tradition of sending wedding guests home with a piece of second cake,
called a "grooms cake," has its origins in early southern [U.S.] tradition. It is a tradition that
almost disappeared by today is experiencing a revival of sorts. The modern-day groom's cake is
often a chocolate cake, iced in chocolate, or baked in a shape, such as a football or a book, that
reflects an interest of the groom. It is to be used as a second dessert, it is placed on a separate
table from the wedding cake and cut and served by the wait staff. At a small, at-home wedding, it
is placed on a separate table from the wedding cake and is served. Having a special groom's cake
is a charming personal touch. Some couples ask to have the groom's cake packaged, festively
wrapped and tied with a ribbon, in small boxes to send home with departing guests."<br>

"A reliable history of the groom's cake is tough to trace. Most bakers think it's a Southern tradition
with Texas roots. The story goes that a bride wanted a chocolate cake for her wedding, but didn't
want to sacrifice the white-on-white theme. So the smaller dark cake was assigned to the groom,
served separately and decorated more modestly. As it's become more common, the groom's cake
has taken on a life of its own. It has design flair, and usually includes radical flavorings
to match the decorating style."<br>

originated in corporate test kitchens or customer's homes. We do know, however, food
manufacturers have a reputation for being ingenious marketers. What better way to promote one's
product than to capitalize on a popular recipe? Food historians trace gelatin salads made with soft
drinks [think: Ginger ale Salad]in print to 1912. Cake recipes were a later invention, probably sometime after World War
II. 
<p>
Newspaper articles confirms this genre of cake making belongs to the
South. No wonder! Both Coca Cola (Atlanta) and Dr. Pepper/7UP (Dallas) are southern-based
companies. Our sources do not confirm the exact person/place/date for the genesis of these cakes.
Most generically refer to the cake as "traditional" or "grandma's." How did they start? If one goes
with the "community cookbook" theory, then our hunch is that the recipe was invented (by
accident or on purpose) by an employee of said company. Many soft drink companies give their
employees free samples to take home. If the product's always on hand, it's bound to be used in
some creative ways. A media-blitz in the 1990s reintroduced these confections as "old fashioned:"
<p>
"According to Phil Mooney, archivist for the Coca Cola Company in Atlanta, it is impossible to document just when cooks first
took Coca-Cola in hand. It appears to have started around the turn of the century, he said, want to have been a spontaneous
event that evolved from the fact that Coke was on hand in many American kitchens, not unlike the way wine was in the
kitchens of France...Of all the recipes, the most widespread, according to the Coca Cola Company, is one for a 
gooey chocolate cake with miniature marshmallows, pecans and probably more calories per square inch than anyone can count."<br>
---"Yes it's true, Cooking with Coke," Dena Kleiman, <i>New York Times</i>, June 6, 1990 (p. C6)
<p>
"Something almost mystical and negligibly naughty washes over otherwise calm, collected cooks
when they pour a can of soda into a recipe. It doesn't belong there, and the mere inclusion seems
illicit and risque. But when culinary art turns into pop art, these masters of the kitchen exhibit an
effervescent pride and a willingness to boast of their secret ingredient: the humble soft drink.
That giddiness-along with plain good taste-has fueled the popularity of a cookbook produced this
past year by the Dr Pepper/7Up Cos. Inc. in Dallas. The 88-page, spiral-bound collection of Dr
Pepper and 7Up recipes, created last summer for new shareholders, has been offered free to the
public since fall. "We've mailed out more than 10,000 cookbooks since August," says Tom
Bayer, a spokesman. "It was such a hit with our stockholders that we wanted to offer it to the
public." Although Coca-Cola Cake and Classic 7Up Pound Cake have been recipe box staples for
years, and Dr Pepper had files of published recipes going back to the '40s, Bayer says the
company wanted to update and expand the offerings, lightening the ingredients for the calorie-conscious. The addition of Dr Pepper, the soft drink created in Waco in 1885, or 7Up "needed to
make a contribution to the recipe," Bayer says. "It had to bring its own flavor-texture component
to the dish." The company asked Marilyn Ingram, a home economist, to test, update and expand
some of the cookbooks' recipes. "We were fairly picky with the recipes we put in," Ingram says.
"We made sure they were good recipes and not just a recipe somebody had tossed 7Up in to be
creative." For example, she says, "the Classic 7Up Pound Cake was just as outstanding as
everybody had said it was." Ingram found that just about every time she used 7Up in a batter, she
had good results, especially for fried fish and onion rings. "It seems to really make the batter light
and fluffy and crunchy," she says. She developed recipes for certain categories that were shy on
offerings, such as vegetables, to go with an abundance of recipes for desserts and beverages."<br>

"Now here's a request that really fizzed. Sally Garber of Deerfield Beach asked our readers to come up with a recipe for 7-Up cake with pineapple frosting. We received 72 replies.
Apparently, there are 3 versions of 7-Up cake: A pound cake, baked in a Bundt pan, that is made from scratch; a sheet cake made from a mix; and a 3-layer torte, also made from a mix. The pineapple frosting also comes in many versions. Most readers who sent the pound cake recipe said they usually settled for a simple sprinkling of powdered sugar on this rich cake, or perhaps a light glaze.
Those who sent the sheet cake or the 3-layer recipe tended to use a pineapple frosting, but some recipes called for a cooked frosting while others were for a buttercream type. Some recipes add chopped pecans along with the pineapple; most also added coconut. And while most recipes called for the frosting to be spread on a cooled cake, others specified that the frosting be spread while the cake was warm -- and one said you should poke holes into the warm sheet cake before pouring on a warm frosting.
It wasn't easy deciding which recipes to publish, so we decided to use the first three that we received. It is interesting to note that the recipes came from an amazing number of sources.
Dev Steffen of Miami Springs sent a recipe that builds upon a cake mix, which she got from her husband's Aunt Eleanor. Marge Pruessman of Miami sent a recipe she found in a cookbook called What's Cooking Senora?, published in Venezuela. Fran Rives of Jupiter sent a similar recipe, courtesy of her sister in Oklahoma who assisted in the compiling of a cookbook by doctors' wives entitled Doctor's Orders. An anonymous reader sent a recipe for 7-Up pound cake, from a cookbook compiled by members of the Grand Court of Florida Order of the Amaranth. Connie McGee of Pembroke Pines found her recipe in What's Cooking in our National Parks. Mrs. William Randolph got hers from a cookbook published by a group from Brown's Methodist Church in Jackson, Tenn.
Why would a recipe call for 7-Up? Is it for the flavor? It would seem that the delicate flavor would be masked by all the other ingredients. Connie Bedell of Fort Lauderdale may have the answer. She sent us this quote, from a cookbook published by The Seven-Up Co. in 1957: "Make a cake with the contents of a packaged mix, using 7-Up instead of the liquid in the recipe. You'll be amazed at how light and airy your cake is."
At any rate, here are the recipes. The first is from Mary Jane Altman of West Palm Beach. "It's a little extra effort, but it's worth it," she says. Other cooks who sent similar recipes emphasized that it is important to beat the butter for a full 20 minutes. They also said the cake improves if baked a day before you plan to serve it, and keeps well frozen.
<p>
<b>7-UP POUND CAKE</b><br>
3 sticks of butter (margarine will not do)<br>
3 cups sugar<br>
5 eggs<br>
3 cups flour<br>
2 teaspoons lemon extract<br>
3/4 cup 7-Up<br>
Cream butter and sugar for 20 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time. Gradually add the flour and beat well, then add lemon extract and 7-Up. Bake 1 1/4 hours at 325 degrees in a well oiled Bundt pan. Cool 8 to 10 minutes, then dust with powdered sugar.
While most of the pound cake recipes didn't call for a frosting, Louise Gotti of Port St. Lucie frosts hers with this:
<p>
<b>PINEAPPLE BUTTER FROSTING</b><br>
1/2 cup butter<br>
3 cups confectioners' sugar<br>
1/3 cup crushed pineapple with juice<br>
Cream butter. Add remaining ingredients and continue creaming until mixture is well blended and fluffy.<br>
This is Steffan's recipe for 7-Up cake that begins with a packaged mix. Other similar recipes called for a yellow or a lemon cake mix in place of the pineapple, and lemon or vanilla pudding in place of the pineapple pudding. Pat Krenick of Goulds uses an orange cake mix and lemon pudding. Some cooks bake this in a 9-by-13-inch pan; others in three round pans.
<p>
<b>AUNT ELEANOR'S TROPICAL CAKE</b><br>
1 package Pineapple Supreme cake mix<br>
4 eggs<br>
1/3 cup oil<br>
1 small package instant pineapple pudding<br>
10 ounces 7-Up<br>
Mix all ingredients together and beat at medium speed of electric mixer for two minutes. Pour into greased and floured 8- inch cake pans or 13-by-9-inch pan. Bake 25 to 30 minutes in a 350-degree oven.
Note: the baking time varies greatly from recipe to recipe; some call for 40 to 45 minutes of baking.>
<p>
<b>PINEAPPLE FROSTING</b><br>
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar<br>
1/4 cup butter<br>
2 eggs<br>
1 small can flaked coconut<br>
1 small can crushed pineapple<br>
Beat together sugar, eggs and butter until smooth, then stir in coconut and pineapple. Frost on cooled cake.<br>
This recipe for a cooked frosting comes from Krenick, who says the 7-Up cake with this frosting always is requested for family birthdays and special occasions. She got her recipe from friends in Arkansas:
<p>
<b>PINEAPPLE FROSTING</b><br>
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar<br>
1/2 stick butter<br>
2 tablespoons flour<br>
2 eggs<br>
1 small can crushed pineapple in heavy syrup<br>
Note: some recipes call for the exact same ingredients, except a large can of pineapple.<br>
Mix ingredients together and cook until thick and transparent. Remove from stove and add 1 cup coconut. When cool, fill and frost cake.
Finally, just to be sure we've had the last word on 7-Up cake, here's a recipe from Bedell that will really top it all:
<p>
<b>7-UP ICING</b><br>
2 egg whites<br>
3 tablespoons 7-Up<br>
1 cup granulated sugar<br>
1/4 tablespoon cream of tartar<br>
Put all ingredients in the top of a double boiler over boiling water. Upper pan should not touch surface of water. Beat 
with rotary beater until stiff enough to stand inpeaks, (about 5 minutes)."<br>

The earliest print reference we find to Earthquake Cake was published in review of Vivande Porta Via, a box-lunch caterer stationed at San Francisco International Airport. It is described 
thusly: "Earthquake cake, a flourless chocolate cake with a cracked top." ("At the Nation's Table: San Franciso," Jeanette Ferrary, <i>New York Times</i>, January 20, 1988 p. C3). The 
chef-owner(s) were Carlos and Lisa Middione. How was it named? "One of Middione's devoted clients was overheard saying "You don't think they're going to sell that 
cake, do you? It look as if it's been in an earthquake." And thus, the cake was named."<br>
---"Lasting Temptation of Chocolate," Leslie Deddell, <i>Colorado Springs 
Gazette Telegraph</i>, February 14, 1990 (p. D1) 
<p>
This cake is perfectly period correct. Born in a time when decadent chocolate desserts were 'to die for.' Flourless 
Chocolate Souffle cakes exploded into <a href="foodcakes.html#chocolatelava">Molten Lava Cakes</a> and  
<a href="foodcakes.html#mud">(Mississipi) Mud Cake</a> made cracked tops fashionable. <a href="foodcakes.html#earthquakepopular">Box-mix earthquake cakes
</a>, on the other hand, were actually inspired by a real earthquake.
<p>
<b>Middione's Earthquake Cake</b><br>
"This recipe appears in Susan Costner's "<i>Good Friends</i>" book, but it comes originally from Carlo Middione, an Italian cook and author who runs the 
popular San Francisco lunch and carryout shop, Vivande. The cake was given the name "earthquake" because the top crust is flaky after baking and falls slightly in 
the middle. Earthquake cake is made in a springform pan -- it is quite high -- so the sides can be released and lifted off. The cake is dense, but very moist,
 intensely chocolatey and luscious. When you cut into it, the texture is supposed to be quite wet. <br>
24 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, broken into pieces <br>
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut up <br>
8 large eggs, at room temperature <br>
3 cups confectioners sugar, sifted onto waxed paper or into a bowl <br>
1/2 cup potato starch <br>
2 cups heavy cream, softly whipped (for serving) <br>
Set the oven at 350 degrees. Grease an 8-inch springform pan and line the bottom with waxed paper or parchment paper cut to fit it exactly. Grease the paper and 
dust the inside of the pan with flour, tapping out the excess. In the top of a double boiler set over (but not touching) simmering water, melt the chocolate the butter
 together, stirring with a rubber spatula. Lift off the double boiler top and leave the chocolate until it is cool but still liquid. In the largest bowl of an electric mixer
 beat the eggs over a medium heat until they are thick and heavy ribbons form on the batter when the beaters are lifted. (CORRECTION: Because of a reporter's
 error, a line in the San Francisco Earthquake Cake directions in the Jan. 27 Food pages was incorrect. The eggs should be beaten with an electric mixer at
 medium speed (not over medium heat) until they are thick and form ribbons.) Fold the chocolate mixture into the egg batter, then fold in the sugar and potato 
starch. Gently pour the batter into the springform pan and transfer the cake to the center of the oven. Bake it for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until it is soft in the
 middle and cracked slightly. Leave the cake to cool completely, then slide a knife around the edge to release it from the sides, if necessary, and unclamp the spring.
 Lift off the ring. Use two wide metal spatulas to release the cake from the bottom of the springform and carefully transfer the cake to a board. Cut it into wedges
 -- you will not be able to keep the wedges perfectly intact, so don't worry if it gets a little messy -- and transfer them to dessert plates. Garnish each plate with a 
spoonful of softly whipped cream and serve at once."<br>---"A Super Bowl Feast," Sheryl Julian, <i>Boston Globe</i>, January 27, 1988 (p. 37)

<b>Box-mix homemade Earthquake Cakes</b><br>
Our survey of regional USA newspapers confirms popular recipes titled "Earthquake Cake" first surfaced in 1990. The locus of origin appears to be Missouri. The 
earthquake connection? A mild tremor rocking eastern Missouri on September 26, 1990 followed by a prediction for a larger natural disaster on December 3rd. The 
later quake did not happen. 
<p>
The standard Earthquake Cake recipe belongs to the culinary genre called convenience: quick assembly of pre-packaged goods. The recipe itself screams "back of 
the box," (Betty Crocker is known for its German Cake Mix, the only brand name ingredient on the list) but we cannot confirm this shaky cake was created in
 corporate test kitchens. Over time Earthquake Cake morphed from trendy to traditional. Local bakers won several blue ribbons at fairs for their creations and 
recipe exchange columns continue to receive requests. 
<p>
"Some residents of eastern Missouri are quaking because of a scientist's prediction of a severe earthquake and a mild quake that occurred last month. "It's panic," 
said Dominic Gragnani, disaster specialist with the St. Louis County Office of Emergency Management. "When the quake hit Sept. 26 we were at the boiling level, 
and that blew the lid off the pot," he said. 'Kind of Nuts'... Earthquake Cake Includes 'Big Fault' St. Louis - One homemaker said she has taken a scientist's
 earthquake prediction seriously, but she has found a lighter side. "I bake an earthquake cake," Meg Huber, a suburban mother of five, said with her tongue in 
cheek. "It has a great big fault down the middle." She said she follows this recipe: Prepare a box-mix cake and place it in the oven to bake at 350 degrees. 
When the cake is half-baked, open the oven door and then slam it. "That causes the fault, usually right down the middle," Mrs. Huber said".<br>

"Eccles cakes, small English cakes similar to Banbury cakes, except that they are normally round
in shape
and they filling has fewer ingredients; currants, wheat flour, brown sugar, butter and vegetable fat,
milk, and
salt are standard. The cakes take their name from the small town on the outskirts of Manchester
where
they were first made and named. Mrs. Raffald (1769), herself from Manchester and the author of
one of the
best cookery books of the 18th century, had given a recipe for  'sweet patties' which may well
have been
the confections from which Eccles cakes evolved...The first mention of eccles cakes by name
seems to
have occurred at the end of th 18th century when a certain James Birch was making them. An
apprenctice
of his, William Bradburn, had set up a rival operation by about 1813. Evelyn Vigeon...in her
brilliant and
comprehensive history of these cakes describes the confrontation:
<blockquote>
James Birch advertised that he was the original Eccles cake maker <i>removed from across the
way</i>,
while William Bradburn retaliated with an advertisement claimimg that his shop was the <i>only
old original
Eccles Cake Shop. Never removed</i>. This rivalry was to the advantage of both manufacturers
over the
following century since visitors would often buy cakes from both shops to be sure they had indeed
tasted
the original one.'
</blockquote>
The same author traces the later history of these and other Eccles cake establishments...She
believes that early Eccles cakes may well have differed from those known now, both in shape
(some at least were sold cut in squares) and the nature of the pastry (puff or flaky pastry is now
used), and ingredients for the filling. She points out that the fact that Eccles cakes were being
exported abroad by 1818 suggests very good keeping qualities,  so they may well have included
spirits such as brandy and rum in the same way as the nineteenth century Banbury cake'. Chorley
cakes are a variation of Eccles cakes, usually somewhat plainer."<br>

<b>Mrs. Raffald's recipe for Sweet Patties, 1769:</b><br>
 <blockquote>
<b>"Sweet patties.</b><br>
Take the meat of a boiled calf's foot, two large apples and one ounce of candied orange, chop
them
very small. Grate half a nutmeg, mix them with the yolk of an egg, a spoonful of French brandy,
and a
quarter of a pound of currants clean washed and dried. Make a good puff paste, roll it in different
shapes, as the fried ones, and fill them the same way. You may either fry or bake them. They are a
pretty side dish for supper."<br>
---<i>The Experienced English Housekeeper</i>, Elizabeth Raffald, intorduction by Roy
Shipperbottom
[Southover Press:East Sussex] 1997 (p. 79)<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Compare with this British recipe, c. 1894:</b><br>
<blockquote>
<b>"Eccles Cakes</b>.--Required: some paste, a filling made by mixing a pound of washed and
dried
currants, six ounces of moist sugar, two ounces of chopped candied peel, and a saltspoonful of
grated
nutmeg. Cost, about 1d. Each. The cuttings of puff or flaky paste will do for these, and are often
used, though the cakes are nice when paste is made purposely. It should be thinly rolled and cut in
rounds; a teaspoonful of the mixture is put in the middle, and the pastry doubled over like a ball; it
is
then pressed on the board to make round flat cakes, the size of the top of a small tumbler. Three
small cuts should be made with a knife, and the cakes finished off like Banbury cakes.
NOTE.--The
filling for these is sometimes the same as Banbury cakes, or a little grated apple is added to the
mixture given, with an increased quantity of sugar if required."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Election cake</b></font><br>
The history of Election Cake is an excellent lesson in food lore. Food historians
generally place the origin of Election Cake  in 18th century New England, most notably Hartford,
Connecticut. As the name implies, the recipe is somehow connected to politics. Culinary experts
confirm the original item was not a true cake (as we know it today), but a simple, sweetened yeast
bread composed of dried fruit and spices. Amelia Simmons [1796] is often credited for providing
the first printed recipe entitled Election Cake.  Some contend the recipe was known as early as
1771, others peg it to the 1830s. Other names for this cake are Hartford cake and
Commencement cake. Therein
concludes the agreement.
<p>
What makes the history of Election cake so interesting are the conflicting theories regarding the 
"why and when" this cake was served. While many people today assume it's a November treat,
history tells that's not likely. Elections are moveable feasts. We find several historic references to
Election cake placing it anywhere from mid-January to June. The month with the most
documentation is May. This is what the food historians have to say:
<p>
"So what then is the how, when, where, what and why of Election Cakes? The Connecticut
Historical Society provided some answers, but...said...that some conflicts cannot be resolved.
"What you can say...is that this is cake traditionally made in conneciton with elections in Hartford
form pre-Revolutionary times...the <i>Colonial Records of Connecticut</i> from May 1771 show
that one Ezekial Williams Esq. submitted a bill to the Connecticut General Assembly for the cost
of making the  cake for the election'." To understand why the government of the colony of
Connecticut would pay for such a cake, along with other food, you have to know how the
Governor of the colony, and later the state, was elected. In early spring, elections were held in
Connecticut towns, and in May representatives of the towns gathered in Hartford, the capitol, for
the formal counting of the votes, first for Governor, then for Lieutenant Governor and then for
other officials. The counting often went on into the night. The representatives came the day
before and stayed overnight in Hartford...in every Hartford home, Election Cakes were made to
serve the out-of-town lodgers. According to...[The Connecticut Historical Society], housewives
planned for Election Day well in advance and made cakes that would keep. By the mid-1800's
Election Day had declined as a major festival and around 1875 the date for election of the
Governor shifted to January from May..."<br>
---"Election Cake: A Noble Tradition, Marian Burros, <i>New York Times</i>, November 2,
1988 (p. C12)
<p>
"Election cakes date from well before the American Revolution. They were very large, enriched 
yeast cakes, tasting like modern coffee cakes or Hot Cross Buns. In England such cakes were
called "great cake" and made for local festivals. The Puritan election cakes were made for
Election Day, Muster Day or Training Day. These were spring and September (a second training
day) [and] regional gatherings to elect local officials...The custom persisted into the 1820s, but by
then the larger cakes were, in Lydia Maria Child's cookbook,'old fashioned'."<br>

"Election cake. A raised fruitcake of New England, first mentioned by Amelia Simmons in her
<i>American Cookery</i> as early as 1796, although, as the name indicates, records show that
such cakes have been baked to celebrate Election Days at least as early as 1771 in Connecticut.
Although this practice spread throughout the Midwest and West in the nineteenth century, the
cake is usually associated with Hartford, Connecticut, and, by the 1830s, was often called
"Hartford election cake." There were also "election buns," which were doled out along similar
party lines. Cookies, usually of gingerbread, served at such functions were often called "training
cakes," because another name for Election day was "Training Day."<br>

WHAT EXACTLY IS ELECTION CAKE?
<p>
Contrary to some reports, Election cake was not invented by American colonists. It was
borrowed (and/or adapted) from popular period English yeast breads.
<p>
"The American or Hartford election cake is American in name only. The cake itself is a classic
English "rich cake," "loaf cake," or "fruitcake," which went by many names and varied many
ingredients. Martha Washington wupplies the essential in her many kinds of "great cake," listed in
<i>The Booke of Sweet-meats</i>, always beginning with barm, the froth produced by
fermenting ale. Amelia Simmons calls these "emptins," a contraction of "emptyings," which meant
the yeasty dregs in the bottom of a cask of ale. On baking day, a thrifty housewife would use
some of this yeast to make a richer dough than bread and she might use some of her raw bread
dough as a starter or sponge for cake..."<br>

Food historians generally cite Mrs. L.H. Wiggin's recipe published in the February 1978 issue of
<i>Southern Living</i> magazine (p. 206) as the first printed reference to "Hummingbird Cake."
Mrs.
Wiggins did not offer an explanation of the name.  Evidence strongly suggests this cake was
popular in the
south and known by several different (and equally interesting) names. 
<p>
Where did this cake originate and why is it named such? Recent evidence suggests this confection descended 
from Jamaican roots. The hummingbird (aka Dr. Bird) is one of the national symbols. Notes below also suggest the
cake we know know today was adapted for American tastes:
<p>

"29 March 1969, Kingston (Jamaica) Daily Gleaner, pg. 7: Press kits presented included Jamaican menu modified for American kitchens, and featured recipes like 
the Doctor Bird cake, made from bananas."<br>

"When it comes to cake, the Dr. Bird or Hummingbird Cake recipe has been one of the most popular through the years. Originally the recipe came to me during 
the late `60`s, as I recall, from the Jamaican airlines...Ruth Threat of Matthews even sent a picture of a Dr. Bird, a national symbol of Jamaica "<br>
---"HUMMINGBIRD CAKE FROM JAMAICA REMAINS POPULAR," Helen Moore, <i>Charlotte Observer</i>, November 23, 1986
<p>
<b>This is what the food writers say:</b><br>
"But the sweetest import from below the Mason-Dixon line might be hummingbird cake, which
has started popping up
at popular baking spots around town with little fanfare - fine Southern upbringing indeed. To
many Southerners living
in New York, the concoction of mashed banana, pineapple, pecans, and cream cheese icing
weighing more than your
average one-year-old serves as a sweet, immediate reminder of home. The impressive looking
three-layer treat seems
like it would be tough to make, but is, in fact, quite easy; it can be whipped up in a little more
than an hour. The exact
origin of the cake remains a mystery. In 1978, a Mrs. L.H. Wiggins of Greensboro, N.C.,
submitted the recipe to
<i>Southern Living</i> magazine, the Southern belle bible of gracious hostessing, and the cake
became renowned. "It is
still our most requested recipe," says Donna Florio, a senior writer at the magazine."<br>

"IT SEEMS as if just about everyone but yours truly had a recipe for the Cake That Doesn't Last.
Then a reader clued me
with a December 1972 date and I found our copy in the older files. Meanwhile we have been
swamped with telephone
calls and letter, far too many to credit individually. Be assured, however, that all assistance was
appreciated. Elizabeth
Bartlett of North Little Rock, the first to reach us via telephone, said that the cake also is known
as Hummingbird Cake.
The bird connection puzzles me, just as it does Juliet Macy of Bull Shoals, who describes the cake
as very rich and
heavy. Macy also said it is a delicious cake, an evaluation with which everyone seems to agree.
Virginia Raney of
Russellville, who has made the cake many times, said, " Sure enough, it doesn't last!' Pat Jefferson
of Paron, noting that it
is a family favorite, added that it has replaced fruit cake at their holiday table. Never Ending Cake
is the name turned in
by Pauline Isley. A Benton respondent supplied Jamaican Cake, a title that might not be far afield
considering the
ingredients. Ella Sheets knows it as Granney's Best Cake.
Nothing Left Cake is the name supplied by Patricia H. Downes of Jacksonville, who, with her
8-and 11-year-old sons,
prefers it sans icing. More than 75 copies of the recipe have been received, most of them identical.

<p>
We wonder if  hummingbird cake was named in reference to how these birds eat.  These tiny
creatures are
drawn to intensely sweet food sources. They engage the food source quickly and disperse when
sated.
Some of the descriptions we read regarding how this cake attracts people and is consumed
quickly reminds
us of hummingbirds eating patterns. PLEASE NOTE: This is our theory, not a documented fact.

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Ice Box Cake (aka Refrigerator Cake)</b></font><br>
Ice box cakes descend from 19th century
<a href="foodicecream.html#icecreamcake">ice cream cake</a> which descend from Colonial Era 
<a href="foodfaq1.html#charlotte">Charlottes</a> which descend from Renaissance-era <a
href="foodfaq1.html#englishtrifle">Trifles</a>. There is no specific
person or company credited for creating the first ice box cake. The evolution was inevitable. 
<p>
Ice box cakes, as we Americans know them today, were introduced during World War I. 
In the 1920s & 1930s these trendy cakes were promoted as "modern" because they embraced
commercial shortcuts: store-bought ladyfingers, crushed graham crackers, & packaged cookies.
Companies manufacturing refrigerator cake ingredients (condensed milk, marshmallows, wafer
cookies, tub whipped cream, electric refrigerators) capitalized on this trend with "back of the box" recipes and company brochures.
When ice boxes became extinct recipes were renamed "refrigerator."
<p>
Our survey of historic newspapers (best source for trending recipes) and cookbooks confirm early recipes combined cake
(sponge, ladyfingers) with whipped cream or custard filling. Ingredients were layered in molds or loaf pans. The earliest
recipe we have employing cookies (vanilla wafers) is a Nabisco cooking booklet, c. 1932. The earliest recipe
we have combining chocolate wafers and whipped cream to create the classic festive "ice box log" is 1935.
<p>
Ida Bailey Allen, popular home economist, described ice box cakes this way:<br>
"Icebox cake is an adaptation of either a charlotte or Bavarian cream, or a mixture of both. It
always calls for whipped cream in some form and freqently for butter. Nuts are often added and
the mould is either decorated or put together with some sort of a cake mixture, as macaroons,
sponge cake, angel cake, or lady fingers. In any case the dessert is so extremely rich that it should
be served only in small quantities in a meal containing very little fat."<br>

<blockquote>
<b>[1917]</b><br>
"An absolutely new confection is the refrigerator cake, which is being served occasionally at parties in Kansas City when the
hostess takes a vacation from Hooverizing, for the ingredients are expensive. However, it makes a very large cake. The unique
feature is that no baking is required, and the cake is served cut in wedge shaped pieces like pie. In fact, it is really more like
a very sumptuous pudding. To make it, take half a pound of unsalted butter (which can be purchased at the larger markets), one half
pound of powdered sugar, one-half pound of crushed macaroons, one-half pound of blanched almonds, one-half dozen eggs, 
and one and a half dozen lady fingers. Beat the egg yolks till thick and lemon colored; beat the whites till stiff; cream together
the butter and sugar, chop the almonds and crush the macaroons. Mix all together. In a round loaf cake pan arrange the lady fingers, 
split in halves around the edge, so that they all form an upstanding border. The pour in the cake batter. The best pan to use is
a large one that has removable sides and bottom. The success of the cake depends largely on the thorough beating given the yolks
of the eggs. They would be beaten until as thick as mayonnaise. Instead of being baked the cake should stand in the 
refrigerator for at least thirty hours before being cut. Serve with whipped cream piled on top."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Japanese Fruit Cake</b></font><br>
According to the food historians, the geographic locus for this holiday dessert stretches from Southern Appalachia, throughout the Deep South, and west to Texas.
 This generally follows the same pattern as the popularity of coconut, one of the prime ingredients. None of the food history reference books we examined provides 
an explanation for the Japanese connection. In fact, most note the ingredients are in no way connected with the Orient in any way. Our study of historic sources 
confirms not one, but two completely different versions of Japanese Fruitcake: <ol>
<li>Popular southern enriched spice layer cake with coconut filling and/or icing, likely descended from 19th century southern-style White Fruitcake.
<li>An iced fruitcake promoted by a Kate Brew Vaughn, a popular cookbook author (no coconut).
</ol>
Ms. Vaughn explains why she picked the name for her cake. Southern cooks are "mum" on the subject. Who decided to renameWhite Fruitcake and why? We 
have no clue.<p>
<b>STANDARD STORIES</b><p>
"Japanese Fruitcake is an exotically named, typically Southern dessert cake, especially popular in the twentieth century. This same cake was once called Oriental 
cake, but there is nothing of the Far East about it, except the spices, none of which is Japanese in origin. Like Lane Cake and Lady Baltimore, Japanese Fruitcake
 is one of the Edwardian dessert extravaganzas with its rich fruit and nut fillings hidden under mounds of fluffy white icing."<br>
---<i>Biscuits, Spoonbread, and Sweet Potato Pie</i>, Bill Neal [Alfred A. Knopf:New York] 1990 (p. 295) 
<p>
"Japanese Fruitcake. This marvelous cake was my mother's favorite...While the name is somewhat mysterious (with no Japanese ingredients), the cake is a 
descendent of the traditional English pound cake and, of course, the giant colonial-era fruitcakes that were the rage through the South."<br>
---<i>Smokehouse Ham, Spoon Bread & Scuppernong Wine: The Folklore and Art of Southern Appalachian Cooking</i>, Joseph E. Dabney [Cumberland House:Nashville TN] 1998 (p. 420) 
<p>
"Japanese Fruitcake. This beloved Southern fruitcake bears little resemblance to the traditional fruitcake. It begins with a yellow cake, the batter is divided, then 
two-thirds of it is enriched with raisins and spices. I've never encountered Japanese Fruitcake outside the South, in fact rarely out of the Carolinas. And then mostly
 at Christmastime in the homes of friends. Nor have I ever heard any explanation of its unusual name; certainly there is nothing Japanese about Japanese 
Fruitcake...While I can't prove it, I feel certain Japanese Fruitcake belongs to the twentieth century. I have rarely seen recipes for it beyond community fund-raiser
 cookbooks and in these only from the '30s onward."<br>

<b>KATE BREW VAUGHN'S JAPANESE FRUIT CAKE, circa 1913</b>
<p>
The earliest print reference we find to a recipe titled Japanese Fruit Cake is from 1913. It is one of many in the popular culinary repertoire of Kate Brew Vaughn, a travelling home economics specialist, cookbook author, and cooking class demonstrator. She was a native of Nashville, TN. This snippets explain the Japanese connection:
"Mrs. Vaughn is going to tell News readers who attend her lecture-demonstrations about a very wonderful cake, the recipe of which was given to her by a former Japanese chef who for years prepared food for the laste Mikado. This cake, which Mrs. Vaughn will bake for Galveston women, has that characteristic charm of the Flowery Kingdom about it. It is rich in fruits and spices. Mrs. Vaughn is going to hold this recipe as a surprise. You will hear more about the famous 'mikado cake' later."---"Mrs. Vaughn to Lecture for News," Galveston Daily News, March 12, 1913 (p. 14)
"The final lesson was a fitting climax to the week. Mrs. Vaughn demonstrated the making of her famous Japanese fruit cake. The recipe of this she does not allow to be published but she freely gave it to all present yesterday and also show them how to secure the best results."---"Mrs. Vaughn Ends Cooking Classes Here," San Antonio Light, April 13, 1913 (p. 6)

Italians have been creating fabulous rich egg cakes cakes composed of nuts and sweet, sealed with creamy dairy fillings 
from ancient times forward. Cheese cakes and cannoli are two shining examples. 
Italian Cream Cake, as we Americans know it today, descends from this culinary tradition. While no one claims 
to have invented this particular cake ("set of cakes" really, since there are dozens of variations), food historians 
generally agree Italian Cream Cakes are related to Renaissance-era Trifles. Combinations of sponge, cream, & flavorings are 
endless. Think: <a href="foodfaq1.html#englishtrifle">English Trifles/Zuppa Inglese</a> & <a href="foodpuddings.html#
zabaglione">Zabaglione/Zabaoine</a>.
<p>
The earliest print reference we find for Italian Cream Cake in North American newspapers is 1913. We have no clue what the actual recipe/dish was like. In 1937 we find an actual recipe. It's a far cry from 
what you find today on the Internet.

"With the records written in Latin, traces of everyday life buried in medieval kitchen refuse, and
no extant
cookery books from the [Medieval] period written in Polish or even claiming to be Polish, how do
we arrive
at the Polish table with a firm sense of cultural identity? Surely medieval Poles understood who
they were
and readily recognized certain foods as peculiarly their own. But perhaps this identity was also an
evolving
one, just as the Polish language itself was evolving at the time. During the thirteenth and
fourteenth
centuries, Polish was heavily influenced by Czech, from which it borrowed many words and
concepts. Was
food likewise influenced by this same flow of ideas? The appearance in Polish of the Czech terms
like
kolace (from Latin collatio) would suggest this."<br>

Apfelkuchen descended from a long line of <a href="foodcakes.html#galette">sweet yeast breads</a>. Food
historians tell us ancient bakers in the middle east often used fruits and nuts in their breads, cakes,
pastries, and cookies. This tradition was also practiced by the Ancient Romans, who are credited
for spreading fruits (apples) and recipes throughout Europe.
<p>
Apfelkuchen in a German word that literally translates into "apple cake." There are dozens of
variations on this simple theme ranging from apple chunks in basic dough to complicated
compotes encased in batter cakes. While the title of this particular cake is German, the recipe is
also known in other European countries. The central core is generally this: apfelkuchen is a simple
recipe, one enjoyed by the  'average' person. <a href="foodcakes.html#streusel">Streusel topping</a> is traditional.
<p>
Recipes for kuchen of all types were introduced to America by settlers of Northern European
descent. Most notably are the Germans, who settled here in great numbers.
<p>
"Kuchen can usually be translated as cake (large or of biscuit size)...Although Kuchen often refers
to something less fancy than a Torte, one of the most famous Kuchen is very fancy indeed. This is
the Baumkuchen...Streuselkuchen (crumble cake) can be a plain rubbed-in cake..with
cinnamon-flavoured crumble topping. A more elaborate version, called Apfelstreuselkuchen, has a
layer of
apple...pure between two layers of crumble."<br>

"Kuchen. The German word for cake or pastry. Kuchen is a cake or pastry made with a sweetened
yeast-risen dough that is either topped with a mixture of sugar and spices or nuts or filled with
fruit or cheese before baking. Kuchen is the classic coffee cake and is served for both breakfast
and dessert."<br>
---<i>The International Dictionary of Desserts, Pastries, and Confections</i>, Carole Bloom
[Hearst:New York] 1995 (p.167)
<p>
"Kuchen, any of several varieties of coffee cake, were the pride of every nineteenth-century
immigrant German baker, both Jewish and non-Jewish. Each cook or housewife had a yeast-based
"kuchen" dough, which she would shape into rectangular crusts and top with either fruit or
cheese, or she would twist with cinnamon and nuts into a streusel or coffee cake, or roll up
jelly-roll style in to Schenecken...By the end of the century, baking powder came into use and
replaced
yeast in many kuchen. Quick breads and cakes gradually replaced the slower yeast-raised doughs.
In May 1906, the <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i> ran an article on kuchen by Lola D. Wangner.
"There seems to be a steadily-growing fondness among us for the German coffee-cakes or
 kuchen...They are to be found on many of our breakfast-tables on Sunday morning. These cakes
are peculiar to Germany, every part of the Fatherland having its own methods of making them,
and there are more than one hundred recipes."<br>

 Culinary historians generally agree that torten, a specialty of Austria and neighboring regions

What is torte?
<p>
"Torte. The German word for cake. Tortes are usually made with flour, sugar, eggs, and gutter,
but often ground nuts or bread crumbs are substituted for some or all of the flour. Tortes have a
moist quality that keeps them fresh for several days. A torte may be either a multilayered cake or
a dense-textured single-layer cake...Tortes originated in Central Europe."<br>
---<i>International Dictionary of Desserts, Pastries and Confections</i>, Carole Bloom [Hearst
Books:New York] 1995 (p. 304)
<p>
"Torte is a German word which corresponds fairly closely to gateau. Its sister-word, Kuchen, can
usually be translated as cake (large or of biscuit size); but in this case the connection see also
quiche, by derived term. Torte appears in the title of many celebrated Central European
confections, including sachertorte." <br>

<b>About Dobos torte</b><p>
"Dobostorte, named after Dobos, a famous Hungarian chef who created it in 1887, is made by
building up five or more thick circles of savoy sponge sandwiched with layers of a creamed filling,
often flavoured with chocolate. The top layer of cake is covered with a layer of sugar caramel,
marked into portions."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.

<p>
"Jozsef C. Dobos, born 1847, was pround of the fact that an ancestor on his father's side was the
chef of Count Rakoczi. Toward the end of his life he opened a fabulous food specialty shop in
Budapest, where he stocked over sixty different cheeses and twenty-two kinds of champagne and
managed to import every rare seasonal delicacy imaginable. Famous far and wide was his
showmanship, whether it was a machine of his own invention that projected a clock face on the
sidewalk, or his stunt of hollowing out a fifty-kilo cheese, pouring in a magnum of the finest
burgundy, leaving it in the shop window until the wine had completely soaked into the cheese,
then selling pieces to the passionate epicures who flocked to buy from him. It was in this shop
that he created and sold his famous Dobos torta in 1887. He had devised a packaging for sending
this delicacy to foreign countries. Soon everybody started to imitate this cake, mostly with very
bad results. This prompted him to publish the authentic recipe in 1906, donating it to the
Budapest Pastry and Honey-bread Makers Guild. The sensation of the Millennium Exposition in
1896 was the Dobos Pavilion, where guess what was baked and served! One of the four major
works he published is his Hungarian-French Cookbook. It sands as a classic. The world
remembers thte anniversaries of battles and birthdays of great composers--what what city other
than Budapest would stage a full-scale festival to commemorate the seventy-fifth birthday of a
torte? In 1962, Dobos torta had this unique honor when the Hungarian Chefs' and Pastry Chefs'
Association placed a wreath on Dobos' grave to commemorate the seventy-fifth anniversary of
the creation of the Dobos Tortae. After this, in the Hungaria Cafe-Restaurant, they held a
banquet, reproducing one of his great dinners; and for two days the Vorosmarty Pastry Shop sold
only cakes and tortes of his creation. His grandson was presented with a heart made of traditional
honey bread, and a six-foot-diameter Dobos torta was paraded by pastry chefs through the
avenues of Budapest. Dobos died in 1924."<br>

conductor of an orchestra. Somewhere between New York and Wisconsin, he lost both his

<b>About Sachertorte</b><br>
Classic folklore surrounding the origin of the Sachertorte here:
<p>
"Sacher torte. A famous Austrian cake served on festive occasions in German-speaking countries.
It is a rich chocolate sponge cake glazed in apricot, and spiced with bittersweet chocolate. It was
first produced in 1832 by Franz Sacher, chef to Prince von Metternich, and is reputedly the only
cake in the world that was ever the subject of a court case."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to  Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999
(p. 679)<p>
[NOTE: This book contains a brief description of the case. It also refers to another book, Festive
Baking in Austria, German and Switzerland by Sarah Kelly.]
<p>
"Sachertorte. A famous Viennese gateau, created at the Congress of Vienna (1814-5) by Franz
Sacher, Metternich's chief pastrycook. Sachertorte (literally, Sacher's cake')...For years, Vienna
was divided into two camps by the sachertorte controversy. The supporters of the sachertorte as
it was served at the Sacher Hotel--two layers separated by jam, the top being iced--were led by
the descendants of Franz Sacher, who regarded their version as the only authentic one. On the
other side were the customers of the famous Demel patissiere, who based their claim on the rights
acquired by Eduard Demel from Sacher's grandson, who authorized the so-called  "true" recipe
(the cake is simply spread with jam, then covered with icing), as published in Die Wiener
Konditore by Hans Skrach. The Sacher Hotel finally won the court case that fascinated Vienna for
six years. Demel replied by claiming that his was the Ur Sachertorte (the original cake)."<br>
---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, Completely revised and updated [Clarkson Potter:New York]
2001 (p. 1010)
<p>
"The best known of all tortes is the Sachertorte, named for Franz Sacher, chef to Prince Metternich (1773-1859), for whom he created it in 
1832. It was one of the earliest chocolate cakes, made apparently only to please a demanding and somewhat iracible nobleman
who was always requesting new desserts. For Metternich by this time was an old man, no longer the dashing, youthful price who had
dazzled all of Europe at the Congress of Vienna in 1814-1815. But the city has always stood for grandeur and the Sachertorte has become
almost a symbol of Vienna and its talent for good living. Eduard Sacher, grandzon of Franz, allowed the recipe to be publsihed and also 
gave a famous Viennese pastry shop, Demel's, the right to call their version the Genuine Sachertorte. Inevitably, Demel's
rivals protested. The Hotel Sacher, run by a distant cousin, sued, and much to the amusement of the Viennese, it took the
courts seven years to decide in favor of the hotel. The only difference between the two versions was one extra layer of
apricot jam, and not all of Vienna's chefs agreed with the courts."<br>

"To appreciate [the Sachertorte] thoroughly, you must put it in its context. It was created in 1832 at the request of Prince Mtternich...
Compared with the elaborate architectural cakes of the period, it struck people as marvelously new and simple. Later, about 1870,
 the Hotel Sacher was built in the Philharmonikerstrasse. It soon became Vienna's most distinguished hotel; it still is. Around 1912 the hotel's
 most celebrated manager, cigar-smoking Anna Sacher, gave the recipe for the delicious chocolate torte to Olga and Adolph Hess for their
Viennese cookbook. The later became Austria's equivalent of the Fannie Farmer anthology. Using the Hess recipe, Mrs. Ruth P Cass-Emellos, the
New York Times' home economist, developed the adaptation appearing on these pages today...Demel's is a pastry shop in the Kohlmarkt at No.
14, dating form 1813 and generally considered to be the  best in Vienna. In 1934, Demel's concluded a contract with Eduard Sacher, Frau
Anna's only son, whereby it gained the right to serve the "original Sachertorte." (many other Austrian restaurants and pastry shops
now serve the cake also, it should be noted.)"<br>

Baking is both art and science. "Red" cakes may be achieved several ways, including chemical reaction, natural coloring
(crushed red fruit--cherries, strawberries, raspberries or red vegetables--beets) and artificial chemical colorants. Harold McGee's <i>On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen</i> 
confirms this "red"
chemical reaction occurs when combining alkaline (baking soda/powder) with acid (cocoa, buttermilk, vinegar). 
"Chemical leavenings have...effects on both flavor and color...Colors are...affected conditions: browning reactions are enhanced,
 chocolate turns reddish, and blueberries turn green." (p. 534). <a href="foodcakes.html#reddevil">Red Devil Cakes</a> first
surface in the 1930s. <a href="foodcakes.html#beetcake">Chocolate Beet Cakes</a> graced our tables in the mid-1950s.
  <p>
The earliest recipe we found titled "Red Velvet Cake" was published in 1960. Earlier recipes (<a href="foodcakes.html#redvelvetdevilcake">Red Velvet Devil Cake</a>, 1951) are not the same. While some people hypothesize the color of this recipe was inspired by
<a href="foodcakes.html#mystery">tomato soup cakes</a>, our survey of historic does not bear this out.
The color in Red Velvet cake is achieved by chemical reaction (soda=alkaline;vinegar=acid) AND the addition of red food dye. Someone, somewhere, apparently decided old-fashioned "red" was not 
"red" enough. Red Velvet cake was popularized by the <a href="foodcakes.html#waldofredvelvet">Waldorf-Astoria</a> recipe legend and as 
<a href="foodcakes.html#armadillocake">Armadillo Cake</a> in the movie <i>Steel Magnolias</i>. Coincidentally? The earliest recipe we've identified

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.<br>
2. Cream together the shortening and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer until fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well
after each addition. Beat one minute on medium speed.<br>
3. Blend the cooca and red food coloring (the amount of coloring may be reduced but the cake will not have its traditional vivid
red color) and make a paste. Add this and the salt to the creamed mixture. Blend the vanilla and buttermilk. Alternately add this and
the flour to the creamed mixture, beating constantly. Blend the vinegar and soda and beat this in.<br>
4. Meanwhile, butter and flour two nine-inch cake pans. Shake out the excess flour. Add the cake, batter to each pan and 
bake 25 to 30 minutes.<br>
5. Remove the cake layers and let cool on a rack. Turn out.<br>
6. For the filling, combine the butter, sugar and egg yolks in a saucepan. Set the saucepan in a skillet of boiling water and beat
with a wire whisk until thickened. Add the remaining ingredients and blend. Let cool. As the filling stands it will 
thicken more. Spread
between the cake layers and on top. Yield: 8 or more servings. <br>Note: This quantity of food coloring sounds excessive. It was the 
amount listed in several of the recipes. When the recipe was tested recently, we reduced it to about one ounce. If you use the full
amount, according to Carolyn Knutsen, 'it is red.'"<br>

<i>The Waldorf=Astoria Cookbook</i>/John Harrison & Ellen Silverman contains this hotel's "famous" Red Velvet Cake recipe. Which makes us wonder: if 
this cake was truly intimately connected with this famous hotel from the 1920s forward, why no reference to it in prior books or

"After years of enduring the myth, Neiman Marcus had some up with a chocolate chip cookie recipe of its own...On the store's Web page...Neiman Marcus traces 
the tale back to at least the 1930s, when a similar story circulated about the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York. That recipe was for Red Velvet Cake, and the 
reported charge was $100. Jan Harold Brunwald, a folklorist who has written books on urban myths...noted that the Waldorf-Astoria, which did not serve Red 
Velvet Cake when the stories involving it first circulated, eventually came up with a recipe it distributed, much as Neiman Marcus has done."<br>

  The practice of creating fantastic beasts from various food began was known to ancient Roman
  cooks.  Only the very wealthy could enjoy such items. As time, place, and taste progressed
  "illusion food" adapted to suit local needs. Medieval lebkuchen (gingerbread) was often
  molded/decorated in elaborate shapes. 19th and 20th century cooks regularly used cake as a
  sculpting medium. Advances in cake molds, ovens,  and auxillary props facilitated this task.
  Wedding cakes were the first to receive such attention. After WWII, directions for fancy cakes baked in molds and 
  assembled from sheet cakes proliferated. Perhaps for express the delight of children growing up in new suburbs?

Some food historians tell us Chocolate Mayonnaise Cake is a Depression-era dessert "invented" by Best Foods/Hellmann's to promote their
Mayonnaise. Why <a href="foodsauces.html#mayonnaise">mayonnaise</a>? 
According to food historian Jean Anderson, this ingredient
provided an economic substitution for butter and milk. Historic sources confirm cakes including thickened dairy products similar to
mayonnaise consistency (most notably <a href="foodsauces.html#sourcream">sour cream</a>, <a href="foodbeverages.html#sourmilk">
sour milk</a> and <a href="foodbeverages.html#buttermilk">buttermilk</a>) were popular at the time. In both culinary contexts, mayonnaise made sense.
<p>
Was this cake really a "new" invention? No.
An examination of early recipes suggest mayonnaise cakes descend from chocolate-infused spice cakes, popular in the early 20th
century. Subsequent raisin/nut-free variations were similar to 
Red Devil cakes. While Hellmann's didn't invent this delicious confection, the company
deserves recognition for making it popular.

Food historians generally place the genesis of Mystery Cake (spice cake made with tomato soup) in the 1930s. Articles published in the
1960s & 1970s state this cake was amazingly popular. The earliest reference we find in print is this from 1928:

"The opening of the fall season is observed on th menu arranged by Mrs. Mabelle (Chef) Wyman for her demonstrating this afternoon...
Under the dessert classification are velvet cake and mystery cake, a culinary idea of Mrs. Wyman's skill."<br>

"Mystery cake, Campbell's Soup. Cooking with condensed soups (usually Campbell's but Heinz and
Hormel also were popular) had really taken hold in the 1920s, but this recipe was one of  the first
departures from the sauce/aspic oeuvre."<br>

<p>
"Mystery cake (Tomato Soup-Spice Cake). Cakes with alien ingredients--sausage meat, an entire bottle of
red food coloring--have always intrigued American cooks. But none more so than..."mystery cake,"
containing a can of Campbell's condensed tomato soup. Even M.F.K. Fisher...liked tomato soup cake.
She says in <i>How to Cook a Wolf</i> (1942), "This is a pleasant cake,  which keeps well and puzzles people
while you are cooking other things, which is always sensible and makes you feel rather noble, in itself a
small but valuable pleasure." Fisher's recipe differs from the Campbell's in several respects. For starters,
it contains only 3 tablespooons butter and one cup sugar...Even leaner than Fisher's version is cookbook
author Jim Fobel's Mystery Cake of 1932...which, he says "is one of the few old recipes that can be
precisely dated: It was developed in 1932, during the worst of the Depression. In keeping with the rather
desperate circumstances of that time, it contains no eggs and very little butter."<br>

"During the first thirty years of its history, Campbell quite sparingly published recipes that used soup as a sauce, and when
it did, Tomato Soup was usually called for. One of the most long lasting, though perhaps the oddest, was for Tomato Soup Cake; 
the ingredients were:  "2 tbs shortening; 1 c. sugar; 1 egg (well beaten); 1 can Campbell's Tomato Soup; 2 c. flour; 1 tsp. ground
cloves; 1/2 tsp. mace; 1/2 tsp. nutmeg; 1/2 tsp. baking soda; and 1 c. seeded raisins." <br>

Food historians generally agree that sponge cake (as we know it today) was probably a
European recipe invented in the early 19th century. Prior to this there were recipes for
'biscuit bread' or 'sponge fingers' which would have produced a similar product. Sponge
[spunge] cake and it's many variations were used ingredients a several popular
Renaissance-era desserts such as English trifle and fooles. Gervase Markham, Robert
May, and Elizabeth Raffald [early 17th century English cookbook writers] included
recipes for "Fine bread," "Bisquite du Roy," and "Common biscuits," that are close to
sponge cake. 
<p>
"Sponge cake.<br>
a light cake made by the whisking method in which egg yolks are beaten with sugar,
then flour and other ingredients added...The term 'sponge cake' probably came into use
during the 18th century, although the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> has no reference
earlier than a letter Jane Austen wrote in 1808 (she evidently like sponge
cakes)...Towards the end of the 19th century something called a 'sponge-cake pudding'
began to appear, but then became simply sponge pudding."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
748)
<p>
"Savoy, a type of sponge cake...The Savoy biscuit arrived in England early in the 18th
century. However it did not arrive alone. Other similar 'biscuits', named according to
their supposed origins--Naples, Lisbon, or Spanish biscuit--also became popular in
England at that time, and the differences between them, if differences there were, no
doubt perplexed people then as they do now. When Mrs. Mary Eales gave a recipe for
'spunge biscuits' in her <i>Receipts</i> (1718), the situation became clearer, since this phrase
conveys to British ears the correct impression, whereas terms such as 'Savoy biscuit'
suggests something different. Morever, Mrs. Eales specified that the biscuits should be
baked 'in little long pans', which corresponds to the shape of modern sponge fingers
(or Boudoir biscuits)"<br>

L'Opera cake/gateau is a 20th century recipe with Ancient roots. Not unlike <a

<p>
The practice of layering cakes with sweet substances (honey), intoxicating liquors (wine) and
accented with nut flavorings (almonds) was a particular favorite of ancient middle-eastern cooks. The Romans adopted/adapted this recipe and took it with them when they conquered Europe. It is
no accident that 16th century English cooks created "trifle." 
     Chocolate and coffee were introduced to Europe in the
16th-17th centuries but (due to economics) were not incorporated into recipes until the 19th
century.  According to the <i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson (p. 748)
sponge cake was also created in the 19th century. 
     Also related to  L'Opera gateau are Genoise (almond-flavored sponge with various
decorations and fillings)  and Savoy (sponge made by beating egg yolks and whites beaten
separately). About <a href="http://www.foodtimeline.org/sponge">sponge cake</a>.

"A classic for the past twenty years, the Opera was created for those who unabashedly choose
chocolate and butter cream over fruit desserts. What makes this low, flat cake more modern than
any of its predecessors is its shape (usually square or rectangular), and its undecorated sides that
show all the layers. L'Opera is traditionally composed of layers of Biscuit Joconde, an almond
sponge, that have been thoroughly soaked with coffee syrup...Some pastry shops decorate the top
with the word Opera, written in panach with all the swirls that the French love so much..."<br>

<b>MADELEINES</b> (sponge recipe)<br>

The food historians haven't quite determined the exact origin of the Madeleine as of yet. Their
connection to Marcel Proust is his reference to them in the opening lines of his autobiography
<i>Remembrances of Things Past</i>. <a
href="http://www.haverford.edu/psych/ddavis/p109g/proust.html"> Proust's original text</a>.

<p>
"In culinary lore, Madeleines are always associated with Marcel Proust, whose autobiographical
novel, <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>, begins as his mother serves him tea and "those short,
plump
little cakes called  petits madeleines, which look as though they had been molded in the fluted
scallop of a pilgrim's shell." The narrator dips a corner of a little cake into the tea and then is
overwhelmed by memories; he realizes that the Madeleines bore "in the tiny and almost
impalpable drop of their essence, the vast tructure of recollection." ...But Madeleines had existed
long before Proust's boyhood. Numerous stories, none very convincing, attribute their invention
to a host of different pastry cooks, each of whom supposedly named them for some particular
young woman. Only three things are known for sure. One is that Madeleine is a French form of
Magdalen (Mary Magdalen, a disciple of Jesus, is mentioned in all four gospels). Another is that
Madeleines are always associated with the little French town of Commercy, whose bakers were
said to have once, long ago, paid a "very large sum" for the recipe and sold the little cakes packed
in oval boxes as a specialty in the area. Finally, it is alow known that nuns in eighteenth-century
France frequently supported themselves and their schools by making and selling a particular
sweet...Commercy once had a convent dedicated to St. Mary Magdelen, and the nuns, probably
when all the convents and monastaries of France were abolished during the French Revolution,
sold their recipe to the bakers for an amount that grew larger with each telling."<br>
---<i>Rare Bits: Unusual Origins of Popular Recipes</i>, Patricia Bunning Stevens [Ohio
University Press:Athens] 1998 (p. 178)
<p>
"Madeleine, a small French cake associated with the town of Commercy in Lorraine...Legends
about the origin of the name are critically discussed by Claudine Brecourt-Villars [<i>Mots de
table,
mots de bouche</i>, Paris:Stock 1996]. Madeleines have earned themselves an immortal place in
literature, as the taste on one dipped in limeflower tisane provided the basis for Marcel Proust's
celebrated reference to them, and the phrase  a madeleine of Proust...The name  madeleine has
also been applied, for reasons which are obscure, to an English product:  a small individual
sponge cake in the shape of a truncated cone, covered in jam and dessicated coconut, and
surmounted with a glace cherry."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
468)
<p>
"Madeleine...The origin of this  seashell cake so strictly pleated outside and so sensual inside"
(Marcel Proust) is the subject of much discussion. It has been attributed to Avice, chef to
Tallyrand, the French statesman, who had the idea of baking a pound-cake mixture in aspic
moulds. Other authorities, however, believe that the recipe is much older and originated in the
French town of Commercy, which was then a duchy under the rule of Stansilaw Leszczynski. It is
said that during a visit to the castle in 1755 the duke was very taken with a cake made by a
peasant girl named Madeleine. This started the fashion for  madeleines (as they were named by the
duke), which were then launched in Versailles by his daughter Marie, who was married to Louis
XV. The attribution of the cake to Madeleine Paumier, cordon-bleu to a rich burgher of
Commercy, seems doubtful."<br>
---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, Completely Revised and Updated [Clarkson Potter:New
York] 2001 (p. 709)
<p>
"Madeleine...A chronicler of the history of pastry-making ways that the great pastry-cook, Avice,
when he was working for Prince Talleyrand, invented the madeleine.  He had the idea of using
tot-fait or quatre-quarts mixture for little cakes baked in an aspic mould. M. Boucher and Careme
approved of the idea. He gave the name of madeleines to these cakes.' (Lacam, Memorial de la
patisserie.). Other authorities, however, hold that far from having been invented by Avice, these
little cakes were known in France long before his time. They believe that they were first made at
Commercy, and were brought into fashion about 1730, first at Versailles and then in Paris, by

number of small fluted or plain dariole or madeleine moulds (previously buttered inside); these
must be placed on a baking-sheet spread with some charcoal ashes, to the depth of half an inch,
and then baked in an oven of a moderate heat. When they are done, turn them out of the moulds,
and dish them up in a pyramid form. These cakes may also be partially emptied, then filled up with

Lady Baltimore cake descends from the light egg-white tradition of lady cakes. Delicate, smooth, and creamily iced, they were popular from the mid-19th century forwards. As one might 
suspect, there are several recipe variations. Although the name suggests this is a traditional Maryland confection, evidence strongly suggests the cake originated in Charleston, South 
Carolina. <a href="foodcakes.html#lordbaltimore">Lord Baltimore cake</a> is an egg-yolk rich counterpart of questionable origin.<p>
<b>What is a Lady Baltimore Cake? </b><br>
"Lady Baltimore Cake. A moist, pure white, three-layer cake made with a filing of chopped pecans, raisins, and other dried fruit, such as figs, and a billowy white frosting, usually made 
with boiled icing. The cake, which uses egg whites only, not yolks, in the batter, has a delicate fine-grained texture. Lady Baltimore cake is a traditional cake that was originally a 
specialty of the city of Charleston, South Carolina."<br>
---<i>International Dictionary of Desserts, Pastries, and Confections</i>, Carole Bloom [Hearst Books:New York] 1995 (p. 169) 
<p>
<b>For whom was it named? </b><br>
"Lady Baltimore Cake...A legendary dessert, famous throughout the South. This cake is said to have originated with the first Lord Baltimore's wife, for serving at afternoon teas."<br>
---<i> Chesapeake Bay Cookbook: Rediscovering the Pleasures of a Great Regional Cuisine</i>, John Shields [Aris Books:Berkeley CA] 1990 (p. 59) 
<p>
<b>Where did it originate? </b><br>
"Lady Baltimore Cake. A white cake filled with nuts and raisins and covered with a vanilla-and-egg-white frosting. There are several stories of how the cake was named, but he most 
accepted version concerns a cake by this name baked by a Charleston, South Carolina, belle named Alicia Rhett Mayberry for novelist Owen Wister, who not only described the 
confection in his next book but named the novel itself Lady Baltimore (1906). In American food (1974) Evan Jones noted that 'it may also be true that the 'original' recipe became the 
property of the Misses Florence and Nina Ottolengui, who managed Charleston's Lady Baltimore Tea Room for a quarter of a century and annually baked and shipped to Owen Wister 
one of the very American cakes his novel had help to make famous.'"<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food & Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1997 (p. 179) 
<p>
"Despite the fact that the original Lady Baltimore was a yellow cake, the version most Americans now accept as the classic is a silver cake made with plenty of stiffly beaten egg whites.
 Even James Beard, the dean of American cooking, offers the egg-white version in American Cookery (1972). Charleston Receipts (1950) prints both versions. When did the shift from 
whole eggs to whites occur? The earliest whites-only Lady Baltimore I could find appears in Good Housekeeping's Book of Menus, Recipes and Household Discoveries (1922). It calls 
for nine egg whites, confectioners' sugar instead of granulated, and rose extract for flavor. Nearer the Lady Baltimores of today is the one in All About Home Baking, a slim volume of 
recipes put out by General Foods in 1933. Here, Lady Baltimore is introduced as a 'butter cake which uses egg whites only.' My hunch is that General Foods publicized its Lady Baltimore 
in Swans Down Cake Flour ads, possibly on package labels, too, which would explain why silver cake versions have eclipsed the whole-egg original."<br>

"Lord Baltimore Cake...After sampling his wife's egg white-laden cake...Maryland's firs t governor, Lord Baltimore, notces the large amount of egg yolks her ladyship was letting go to 
waste. After giving her a sound tongue-lashing, the governor snatched the yolks form his wife and dashed off to the kitchen looking for the manor's head cook, Miss Florine. Putting 
their heads together, Lord Baltimore and Florine worked into the wee hours of the morning sipping sherry and perfecting a yolk-rich cake. As the sun was rising, and with the sherry
 nearly gone, Lord Baltimore and MIss Florine, in a fit of culinary ecstasy, threw everything but the kitchen sink...into the mixing bowl to provide a filling for their masterpiece. The result
 was a richly textured cake and one of the most festive fillings since the Queen of Sheba's birthday cake in 900 B.C. During my research I was unable to confirm the complete accuracy of
 the details of this historic occasion. Since my grandfather recounted this tale at every Fourth of July cookout, however, I am sure it is very close to what actually happened."<br>

The recipe for ladyfingers (aka biscuits a la cuilliers, boudoir biscuits) originated in Europe (likely
England, France, Italy, or Spain);  the name is English. Food historians tell us these small sponge
cakes were "invented" in the 18th century.

"Ladyfinger. 
A light sponge-cake biscuit. The name comes from the usual shape of the confection, which is
long and narrow, light and delicate...The word often appears in the possessive, "Lady's finger,"
and the plural, "ladies' fingers," and was first mentioned by John Keats in his poem The Cap and
Bells (1820). Ladyfingers have long been a popular confection in America, where some recipes
call for the pastry to be pushed through a pastry tube."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New
York]
1999 (p. 179)

"Boudoir biscuits are in effect the same as sponge biscuits or sponge fingers, ladyfingers (N.
America) and savoy biscuits (an older term). They are long, finger-shaped, crisp sponge biscuits
based on whisked egg and sugar mixtures with a crystallized sugar topping. In France they are
also called biscuits a la cuiller. Helen J. Saberi (1995) has investigated the history and significance
of the unusual name "boudoir biscuits'. Although boudoir entered the English language from
French long ago and its application to these biscuits could therefore have arisen in England, it
seems clear that the French were the first to use the name. Boudoir comes from the French verb
bouder, to pout, and normally refers to a woman's private room where she would receive only her
intimate friends--who could pout and nibble sponge fingers as much as they wished in this
cloistered environment."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davison [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
90-1)
<p>
"Ladyfingers are dry, airy cakes, often with a sugar crust which are made by piping a stiffly
whipped egg-and-flour batter into diminutive oblongs. The sponge batter used for lady fingers
was
developed in Europe by the seventeenth century to produce Naples or Savoy biscuits. Introduced
to colonial America under those names, the cakes were often baked in specially designed tins or
paper cases of varying sizes and shapes. The term "ladies' fingers" was used in America no later
than the 1820s, although recipes for Savoy biscuits, in which one puts the batter "into the biscuit
funnel, and lay it out about the length and size of your finger." <br>

<b>Genoise</b><br>
Genoise is one of several types of sponge cake. According to the food historians, this cake was *invented* in
the early 19th century. About <a href="foodcakes.html#sponge">sponge cake</a>.
There are also other confections known by this geographic appelation. Genoa Cake, for one. These are somewhat similar
in ingredients.
<p>
<b>The Genoa connection</b><br>
Presumably, these recipes are connected with the Italian city of the same name. This busy trading port served as one of several
crossroads for importing/exporting foods from Arab countries throughout Europe. These included ingredients generally found in 
geneoise: almonds, currants, raisins, citrus and spices.
<p>
"Genoa's position in the Mediterranean in summed up in the medieval proverb genuensis ergo mercator, a Genoese therefore a
trader. In the eleventh century, the Arabs began losing their position to the Normans in Sicily. The decline of Arab supremacy
meant the rise of the other powers like Genoa. But by the late fourteenth cetnury, Genoa was in danger of falling to foreign 
domination and decadence. The enterprising Genoese avoided this fate by exploring new ways to assure a prosperous future. Commerica
interests from northern Europe, with their expertise in building mountain roads, found Genoa suitable for their entry into the
profitable shipping trade, and by the fifteenth century Genoa was the leading financial city of the world. Genoa played an early role
as an intermediary between Seville and the New World and forged an alliance with Spain in 1528...The Ariadne's thread 
throughout Genoa's
history is the concern for a reliable food supply...The Genoises were their own principal customers of food, and the
luxuries of the East--which made them rich--were reexported at high profit. Genoa traded with whomever could provide food."<br>
---<i>A Mediterranean Feast</i>, Clifford A. Wright [William Morrow:New York] 1999 (p. 348)
<p>
<b>What makes Genoise special and how is used?</b><br>
"Genoise. A type of sponge cake...but is not to be confused with Genoa cake, which is really a type of light fruit
cake. Whole eggs are beaten with sugar until thick, and the flour then folded in. This type of sponge may be
simply dusted with icing sugar and eaten plain; or split and filled with jam and cream, or butter icing. The top
may also be iced. Sheets of genoise are used to make Swiss rolls. Genoise-type mixtures are also made into
sponge fingers...and French Madeleines."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 334)
<p>
"Genoese Sponge, genoise. A light sponge cake that takes its name from the city of Genoa. Genoise sponge is
made of eggs and sugar whisked over heat until thick, then cooled and combined with flour and melted butter.
It can be enriched with ground almonds or crystallized (candied) fruits and flavoured with liqueur, the rind (zest)
of citrus fruits or vanilla. Genoese sponge...differs from ordinary sponge cake in that the eggs are beaten
whole, whereas in the latter the yolks and whites are usually beaten separately. Genoise sponge is the basis of
many filled cakes. Cut into two or more layers, thich may be covered with jam, cream, or fruit puree. It is
coated, iced (frosted) and decorated as required."<br>

Genoese Cake.</b><br>
Melt half a pound of butter by letting it stand near the fire. Mix thoroughly half a bound of flour, half a pound of sugar, a pinch
of salt, and the finely-minced rind of a lemon. make them into a paste with a wine-glassful of brandy, four eggs, well beaten,

moderate oven. When the cake is sufficently cooked (this may be ascertained by pushing a skewer into it, and if it comes out
dry and clean it is done enough), take it out, and cover it with sugar and blanched almonds (see Genoa Cake). Time, three quarters

<b>What was 18th century "diet bread?" </b><br>
"Diet bread" (also "diet cake", "diet biscuits," <a href="foodcakes.html#dier">"dier bread"</a>) was a small <a href="foodcakes.html#sponge">sponge cake or biscuit</a> in 18th-19th century 
England and America. There is nothing particularly striking about this recipe in either ingredients or method. Except? Its
simplicity. 
<p>
"Diet bread seems to have been of varying composition, but one early type calls for a batter resembling that for lady 
fingers..." <br>
---<i>Martha Washington's Booke of Cookery</i>, transcribed by Karen Hess [Columbia University Press:New York] 1980 (p. 349) 
<p>
"Diet bread, sponge cake...1830 Huntington (Pa.) Gazette 15 Sep. 4/5 [Recipes] Diet Bread. Sponge Cake. Dough Cake."<br>
---<i>A Dictionary of Americanisms on Historical Principles</i>, Mitford M. Mathews editor [University of Chicago Press:Chicago IL] 1951 (p. 485)
<p>
<b>Why the name?</b><br>
Good question. 
According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, "Diet Bread" was consumed by sick people: "diet-bread n. special bread prepared for invalids or persons under dietetic regimen.
1617 S. Collins 
Epphata to F. T. ii. ix. 357 To feede them with such dirt for diet-bread. 
1824 M. R. Mitford 
Our Village (1863) I. 223 Drinking her green tea, eating her diet-bread, begging her gowns." 
Unfortunately, we cannot tell from  these quotes what the recipe was or why it was called such.
 <i>The Oxford English Dictionary</i> and <i>Samuel 
Johnson's Dictionary</i> [1755] provide several period meanings for the word "diet." None of them strike us as the obvious
reason for a recipe title.
<p>
Curiously? The recipes we found for "Diet bread" were grouped with cakes and biscuits, not invalid cookery. 
Descriptions in period newspapers couple diet-bread with plum cakes and sweetmeats, suggesting they were consumed by the
 wealthier classes.  "Healthy breads" of the period 
were generally called "Dyspepsia Bread" and "Graham's Bread." While Colonial Americans had a sense of food and body connection, we find no evidence they
 thought in terms of eating for weight reduction (think: <a href="foodbreads.html#hollywood">Hollywood bread</a>), as we 
do today. 
<p>
<a name="dier">
<b>Dier bread?</b><br>
A late 19th century article suggests diet bread was sometimes pronounced as "dier" or "dyer." The <i>OED</i> defines 
the word "dier" is as someone who is dying.
We might infer from this historic observation "diet bread" was recommended for young folks over richer cakes. 
The same rule logically hold true for the aged and infirm.
The key: "diet bread" is devoid of standard period culinary riches: spices, dried exotic fruits and rich 
cream. This makes sense.
<p>
"Cousin Susan's cupboard also contained stronger waters than tamarind, for side by side sat two corpulent cutglass decanters, of which one was half 
filled with madeira wine, and the other with honest rum. A variety of sweet cakes was near by, to be served with the wine to any chance visitor. There were 
black fruit cake in a japanned box; hearts and rounds of rich yellow pound cake; and certain delicate but in one little sponge biscuit, of which our cousin spoke by the older-fashioned name of diet or, as she chose to pronounce it, dier bread. She always called the sponge cakes little dier breads. Pound and fruit cakes were forbidden to our youth, but we might have our ladylike fill of dier breads, and also of delightful seed - cakes, which were cut in the shape of an oak-leaf, and were 
marvels of sugary thinness. These seed-cakes, by the bye, were kept in a jar which deserves at least a passing mention. It was, I suppose, some two or three feet high, though it looked to me then much higher. It was of blue-and-white china, and was fitted with a cover of dull silver. Tradition stated that some seafaring ancestor had brought it home from Calcutta, filled with rock-candy. What was done with so large a supply of this confection I never knew. In those days choice sugar- 
plums were not as plenty as they have since become; possibly at the time blackjacks and gibraltars were unknown, and this was Salems only candy. At all events, it is somewhere recorded that the ship Belisarius brought from Calcutta ten thousand seven hundred and sixty-seven pounds of this same rocky and crystalline dainty. The fact of such a quantity of candy had for us children a superb and opulent significance. What an idea, to have a choice confection, not by the stick or beggarly 
ounce, but by the jarful! To think of going and casually helping ones self at will! To imagine lifting that silver lid, and gazing unreproved into the sugary 
depths I Perhaps nice, white - haired spinsters used it in glittering lumps to sweeten their tea, or even served it at table by the plateful, as one might serve 
cake. Fancy exhausted itself in all sorts of delightful speculations. The whole legend had a profuse and mythical sound. It was like a fairy tale, a scene from Arabian 
Nights. It threw about the jar and the cupboard a mystic charm which time fails to efface. Even now a stick of sparkling rock-candy has power to call up cousin 
Susans dining-room cupboard, its sweet, curious perfume, the quaint old silver and blue china, and the huge turkey-feather fan, with its wreath of brilliant painted
 flow- ers, which hung on the inside of the door." <br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Texas sheet cake</b></font><br>
Food historians have not quite determined the true origin/history of the Texas Brownie/sheet
cake. They do, however, confirm chocolate cake & brownie-type desserts are early 20th century
recipes. Why? That's when the price of chocolate declined to the point where it was readily
available to general public. What was heretofore considered an expensive treat was now a
common cooking ingredient. Recipes titled "Texas Sheet Cake" surface in the mid-1980s. <a href="foodcakes.html#coloradosheetcake">Colorado Sheet Cake</a>
is a variation on this hometown theme.
<p>
"Texas sheet cake. One of my all-time favorite cookbooks is a little spiral-bound paperback called <i>Food Editors'
Hometown Favorites</i> published in 1984 by the Newspaper Food Editors and Writers Association.
It is appears this heavenly chocolate cake spread with fudge-pecan icing. it was contributed to the
book by Dotty Griffith, food editor of the Dallas Morning News. But the accompanying headnote
says the recipe was also submitted by food editors all over the country. Some attribute the cake to
Lady Bird Johnson. Others say it got its name because it's as big as Texas--well, not quite. The
cake couldn't be easier to make, it's suprisingly light, but my, it is sweet."<br>

<p>
 "What's Cookin'<br>
Question: Where does Texas Sheet Cake get its name? <br>
A) From the super-chocolatey taste, as big as Texas. <br>
B) From the fact that the taste is so intense, people can eat only a small piece - meaning one
cake will serve a Texas-size crowd. <br>
C) From its overall richness - a big taste in a big cake from a state that was supersizing things
long before fast-food places were. <br>
D) All of the above. <br>
The answer, if you've ever tasted the famous cake, has got to be D. Texas Sheet Cake is
chocolate through and through, rich and decadent. As for whether it originally came from
Texas, I couldn't find a  definite answer. But Lone Star cooks were smart to get their state's
name on something that tastes so good."<br>
--- "A chocolate cake from the land of the supersized," Ann Burger, <i>The Post and Courier</i>
(Charleston, SC), January 28, 2001 (p. G6)
<p>
<b>Sheet vs. Sheath cake?</b><br>
Food historians ponder this linguistic puzzle. Without definate conclusion. It appears somewhere
in middle of the 20th century the terms sheet and sheath were interposed. A survey of historic
culinary sources confirm recipes for Shealth/Sheet Cake in the American South are quite similar.
They are generally rich, chocolate-based cakes slathered with equally rich icing.
<p>
"When it comes to desserts, Texans have plenty to brag about. From such delights as Texas Sheet
Cake and Buttermilk Pie to sweet favorites like Peach Cobbler and German Chocolate Cake, the
Lone Star State's signature desserts are as remarkable as the state itself. Everyone has a favorite,
of course, but one of the most universally loved desserts is the Texas Sheet Cake or Texas Sheath
Cake, depending on whose recipe box you're looking in. Cooking instructor and cookbook author
Lenny Angel says she got her recipe for Texas Sheath Cake in 1963 two years before she moved
to Texas from Nebraska. "My mother, who lived in Illinois, mailed it to me. Texas Sheath Cake
has become the birthday cake for my family. My son John adores it so much we had it at his
wedding as the groom's cake," she says. "I have run into zillions of people in my classes that love
that cake. I think it's a family favorite of so many you hardly ever meet anyone who doesn't know
that cake."  Angel theorizes that the real name of the cake is Texas Sheet Cake, noting that
bakeries often sell "sheet" cakes of various flavors. "I think someone had bad ears and didn't hear
right, and that 'sheath' was an offspring of sheet," she says. Angel, whose family now refers to the
cake simply as Texas Cake, says she tried to broaden their culinary horizons by baking "the new
white Texas cake not too long ago. My family nixed it. I loved it, but they didn't," she says."<br>

According to the records of the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov">US Patent & Trademark Office</a>, Twinkie brand snack cakes were introduced to the 
American public by Continental Baking Company (later Hostess) June 25, 1930.

"Twinkies were created in 1930, the same year Continental Baking intoduced sliced bread to a then-skeptical public. Due to the depressed economy, overall sales of
Continental's Hostess cake products were slow at that time. The late James A. Dewar, then a regional manager for Continental Baking Company, was looking for a
way to boost company sales. He noticed that the pans used to make 'little short cake fingers' were collecting dust for most of the year except for the six-week strawberry
season. Dewar decided to inject cakes with a banana creamfilling and market them year-round. The first Twinkies were filled one at a time, using a hand-held piston-type

<b>Product development</b><br>
"The shape and size of Twinkies have changed little since their introduction, althout the content of the snack cake has been modified slightly over the years. During 
World War II, when bananas were hard to come by, Twinkies' banana cream filling was replaced by a vanilla flavored filling. Other changes were minimal until 1970, when
Continental, following food industry trends, began adding vitamins to the snack cake. Continental Baking's biggest change in its Twinkies line occurred in 1988 with the
introduction of Fruit and Creme Twinkies; traditional sponge cake with a strawberry and vanilla cream swirl in the center...Another break from Twinkies tradition occurs
during the slow summer months when devils food Twinkies are sold in selected markets...Twinkies Lights were introduced in 1991...these Twinkies...were 94 
percent fat-free...
<p>
<b>Why call them "Twinkies?"</b><br>
"The name Twinkies was coined by Dewar during a business trip to St. Louis, Missouri, where he saw a billboard advertising 'Twinkle
Toe Shoes.'...
<p>
<b>What was the original price?</b><br>
 "As the economy was tight, Deward decided to market Twinkies as a low-priced convenient snack. He packaged them 'two-to-a-pack for a nickel,'
and targeted the cake's advertising to children...
<p>
<b>When was Twinkie the Kid introduced?</b><br>
"In the mid 1970s the official spokesperson became Twinkie the Kid, and animated cowboy Twinkie character wearing a bandanna, cowboy
hat, and boots...
<p>
<b>What was the "Twinkie Defense?"</b><br>
"Perhaps most damaging to Twinkie's image was its use as a defense for Dan White, a San Francisco city supervisor accused in the 
1979 murder of San Francisco mayor George Mosone and city supervisor Harvey Milk. The defense employed a psychiatrist's statement that
White's diet of Twinkies, Coca-Cola, and potato chips created extreme variations in his blood sugar level. This in turn worsed his
existing manic depression, leading to the murder. The press labeled it "The Twinkie Defense."...
<p>
<b>American icon</b><br>
"American's attitudes toward Twinkies remain ambivalent. The snack cake has been served at the White House, and was the official cake
at Superman's 50th birthday party. Television character Archie Bunker proclaimed them 'white man's soul food' in the series
<i>All in the Family</i>. They've been dubbed the 'quintessential junk food' and an 'icon of American junk food.'<br>

Culinary evidence confirms sandwich cakes originated in the 19th century. Essentially composed

"A sandwich cake is a sponge cake consisting of a layer of filling, such as cream or jam,

---<i>An A-Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 300)
<p>
"The Victoria sandwich, or Victoria sponge as it is also known, was named after Queen Victoria
of Great
Britain, and seems first to have come on the scene after about a quarter of a century of her reign:
the first
known recipe for it is given in Mrs. Beeton's <i>Book of Household Management</i> (1861) (although
from its
placement in the book she seems to regard it more as a dessert dish than a tea-time cake).
Essentially it
consists of two layers of light sponge cake with between them a filling of jam, or sometimes
cream."<br>

"Victoria sandwich cake named after Queen Victoria, is a plain cake made by the creaming
method...closely related to pound cake. Although sometimes referred to as  Victoria sponge cake',
it is not a
true sponge cake in the sense that Savoy or Genoise are. Usually it is cut in half and spread with
jam and/or
cream to give a sandwich. The top is usually dusted with sugar."<br>

Tipsy Parson (aka Tipsy Cake, Tipsy Pudding) descends from Renaissance-era English Trifle. This particular multi-layered sponge cake and cream dessert is 
soaked in alcohol (brandy, sherry, etc.). The "tipsy" refers to what might happen to the diner who eats too much of it! None of our sources offer explanation

"Tipsy cake is a traditional English dessert, first cousin to the trifle. As its name suggests, its key ingredient is alcoholic: it consists essentially of sponge cakes 
soaked in sweet sherry or some other dessert wine, decorated with almonds, and with custard poured round it. The first reference to it was reportedly by the writer 
Mary Russell Mitford in 1806: 'We had tipsy cake on one side, and grape tart on the other.'"<br>

 (1932) whent one step further and combined what was known as hedgehog cake with tipsy cake into a hedgehog tipsy cake. Versions exist in other countries such
 as the Spanish bizcocho borrecho a la crema, a type of sponge cake soaked in syrup flavoured with rum and orange liqueur, and filled with a lemon-flavoured
 custard."<br>

Wacky cake is an interesting study in culinary chemistry.  What sets modern Wacky Cake apart from other
chocolate cakes? Vinegar and method. WWI-era Dump Cakes likely provided inspiration. They do not, however, include vinegar.
Depression-era Crazy cakes feature cocoa, baking soda & baking powder. No vinegar. In sum, recipes with these names vary
greatly according to place and period. The connecting culinary threads are innovation, efficiency, and deliciousness.
<p>
It is interesting to note that two popular 20th century American food history books (Jean
Anderson's
<i>American Century Cookbook</i> and Sylvia Lovegren's <i>Fashionable Food</i>) place this
recipe in
the 1970s. Culinary evidence confirms this recipe existed in the 1940s.  Wacky cake is but one
example of
the
tradition of "make do" cakes that were popular during times of short supply.  Contrary to popular
opinion, <a
href="fooddecades.html#egglesscake"> eggless, butterless cakes</a>  were not invented at that
time,
they were
revived from WWI days (which were revived from pioneer days). Dump Cake is another
descendant of Wacky Cake in method.

"Dump cake. A cake made by "dumping" the ingredients directly into the baking pan, mixing
them, and baking the batter."<br>

"Wacky Cake or Crazy Cake. In a way, this is a variation on Chocolate Pudding Cake...But it

In their most basic form, confections of all kinds can be traced to ancient cooks. Sweetmeats were
popular in Medieval times. The history of modern confectionery is generally traced to Renaissance
Europe, where white sugar (although available) was very expensive and highly prized. At that
time, sugarpaste and marchepane (marzipan: a paste of almonds and sugar shaped into elaborate
forms) were sometimes used to decorate elaborate cakes. Food historians generally trace modern
icing, named such because the finished product, a glaze (aka glace), was supposed to look like ice, to 18th
century England. 
<p>
"In medieval times, icing--a sprinkling of sugar--was put on top of savoury as well as sweet
foods: fish pies, for instance. But the iced cakes we are familiar with today started to emerge in
recognizable form in the seventeeth century; in those days, once the sugar had been applied (either
directly, or to a layer of beaten egg white), the cake was returned to the oven for a while for the
icing to harden. That was still the case in the eighteenth century, when the term icing is first
actually recorded in Elizabeth Raffald's <i>Experienced English Housekeeper</i> (1769)...The
term icing has also in the past been applied to marzipan, as used for topping cakes: Mrs. Beeton
give a recipe for this  almond icing'.  Of roughly equal antiquity with the term icing is frosting,
which is the preferred word in American English. The term icing sugar is first recorded in 1889;
American English also uses confectioners' sugar."<br>

When you have put in all your sugar beat it half an hour longer, then lay it on your almond icing
and spread it even with a knife. If it be put on a s soon as the cake comes out of the oven, it will
be hard by that time the cake is cold."<br>

"Davidson...surveys the evolution of icing in England in the 18th century and 19th centuries and
identifies Mrs. Raffald (1769) as the first author to provide for the combination of cake, marzipan,
and royal icing. Her cake was a  bride cake', which had also been known as a  'great cake' and
only acquired the name  wedding cake' in the 19th century. However, until the late 19th century,
icing was reserved for special cakes. An 18th century icing was usually made by beating the
ingredients together in a mortar, spreading the mixture over the cake, and drying it in a low heat.
Mrs. Glasse (1747) writes :  with a Brush or Bundle of Feathers, spread it all over the cake, and
put it in the oven to dry; but take Care the Oven does not discolour it.' In North America the term
 frosting' has a slightly longer history than  icing', but the two terms became interchangeable and
  icing' has now become the perfect usage.'"<br>

"Though cake icing had begun, perhaps only in the highest circles, in the seventeenth century,
until the early nineteenth century if anything were to be iced it was most likely to be marchpanes
in the early period, tarts rather later. Only a simple glazing was involved when the term  'ice' first
began to be used. The earlier decorated marchpanes already referred to were, as has been seen, to
be washed over with a rosewater syrup before being put into the oven  for that will make the  'Ice'.
The same should, however, also be done with a cake as soon as it came out of the oven...The
addition of white of egg was the beginning of new things an there was always more than one
possibility...The spicing of icings was...already on its way out in the eighteenth century. A simple
version, merely a pound of sugar to the whites of seven eggs, was offered by the first Scottish
cookery book (McLintock 1736)...Starch began occasionally to feature at the same period. It was
often taken up subsequently and came to be added to commercial icing powder when this began
to be manufactured in the mid-nineteenth century. Also in the nineteenth, lemon juice was
substituted for the earlier flower-waters and the passion for whiteness projected some into
including the powder blue. The concern with whiteness had been explicit, despite the somewhat
different initial connotations of the term  ice, since icings in the modern sense developed out of
glazes. Icing was, until much more recent times, an item of lavish display in itself, its whiteness
and direct indicator of the quality and expense of the sugar from which it was produced...By then,
colouring was a possibility, as it had not been at the earlier period, and for that  an inferior sugar
could be used. By then too, perhaps with a change in the ovens used, ...'Cakes should never be
put into an an oven after being iced,'...
     Modification was made over time therefore, and there was some more radical experimentation
continuing too. Hannah Glasse tried adding starch and some gum tragacanth as  another way to
Ice a great Cake in a confused entry of her first edition. In her third,  To Ice a Great Cake she
proposed something altogether different, twenty-four whites to one pound of sugar, put onto a
cold cake:  If does not do well hot....The effect would have been what in modern terms woud
have been a soft meringue rather than icing...Even in the eighteenth century there had therefore
been a good deal of experimentation. Fondant icing was available but mixtures normally termed
 royal icing remained the standard in Britain."<br>

<b>Icing vs. frosting</b><br>
Why two names for the same basic item? The general concensus of the food historians is that icing
is the traditional European term. Frosting is a broader American appellation which includes
cooked, fluffy coatings. Notes here:
<p>
"Icing. A preparation of icing (confectioner's sugar used to coat sweet goods). Glace and royal
icing are the traditional types., but the term covers a variety of cake coverings, including
American frosting--a whisked mixture of egg whites and sugar syrup, prepared over hot water to
give a foamy, soft and sweet surface when cooled. Frosting sets slightly on the surface when

"Frosting. The American term for icing, used as a noun to describe the mixture applied as a cake
covering and filling, and a s a verb to describe the process fo applying it. Frosting covers soft
icings and cake fillings, such as buttercream, chocolate icing, or glace icing, but not royal icing,
which is known by the came name. Outside America, the soft cake covering and filling made by
whisking sugar syrup into egg whites is usually called American frosting." <br>
---ibid (p. 529)
<p>
"Frosting is an alternative term to icing often used in the United States. It seems first to have
been applied to pulverised sugar, perhaps with starch added to reduce caking, when this began to
be manufactured commercially in the mid-nineteenth century. American interest in icings/frostings
has typically been greater than British; a far wider range is generally offered by American cookery
books than by British."<br>

"Icing. A term often interchangeably with "frosting" and preferred in America to describe the
sugar-and-water mixture used to decorate and cover cakes..."Frosting" actually precedes "icing"
in print, the former appearing around 1610, the latter in
1760, with icing considered a somewhat lighter, decorative glaze than frosting. But in America it
became normal to used "icing" (and the verb "to ice") to describe either form of the
confection."<br>

<B>Buttercream</b><p>
An extensive survey of late 19th-early 20th century American cookbooks confirms buttercream
icing (as we know it today) is a modern recipe. Why this time period? Food historians
suggest it might have been the result of product availability and corporate promotion. The two
main factors that set buttercream apart from traditional icings of the day (besides the butter,
course!) are that it does not require cooking or eggs. During World War I eggs were very scarce
and eggless recipes proliferated. Perhaps there is a connection?
<p>
"Butter cream frostings. Strangely, thse easy icings don't seem to have been in the repertoire of
nineteenth-century American cooks, who chose to bind powdered sugar with raw egg white or
yolk. Or to cook their frostings. In searching through several dozen cookbooks dating back to
1880, I found a butter frosting only in the 1915 <i>Larkin Housewives' Cook Book</i>...The
Larkin Company, "Pure Food Specialists," sold chocolate, sugar, salt, assorted flavorings, and
just about everything else the cook needed...Mrs. Fred W. Gurney of North Attleboro,
Massachusetts, ...submitted her Mocha Frosting--the first butter cream I've been able to
locate...A similar mocha frosting appears in the 1918 edition of "Fannie Farmer,"...By its 1923
edition, "Fannie" had added four more butter creams. And by the 1930s, these were the frostings
cooks had come to rely on. For good reason. They were quick, versatile, and foolproof."<br>

Precursors to modern buttercream are late 19th century cake fillings/frostings employing rich
cream. These recipes would have produce a more liquidy type of frosting than we know today,
but the finished product was probably pretty close:<br>

<b>What is Royal icing?</b><br>
"Royal Icing. The harding type of icing used for coating wedding, birthday and celebration cakes; it being almost an airtight
casing, cakes coated with this type of icing will usually keep for a very long time. It consists of icing sugar and whites of
eggs beaten together until they become almost as light and pliable as stiffly whipped cream. A little blue is sometimes added to
give that expert whiteness, and acetic acid to haste its drying or hardening proces.."<br.

<p>
"Royal icing. An icing made from confectioners' sugar, egg whites or dried meringue powder, and

<b>What are the differences/similarities between Royal icing and Buttercream frosting?</b><br>
Royal Icing is traditionally made with egg whites, sugar, lemon juice. It produces a hard product well suited for decoration. Butter Cream recipes are all over the map. 
Original Butter Cream recipes featured sweet butter; subsequent recipes sometimes subsitituted synthetic shortenings. A few also included dairy cream. Butter Cream 
frostings produce a softer, moister covering condusive to conveying flavor rather than artistic decoration. 
<p>
<b>The egg white factor: </b><br>
We're not finding any titled "true butter cream" but we do find several examples with and without egg whites. We even found one with egg yolks! Early 20th century 
professional texts generally include egg white. Home cookbooks often omit this ingredient, esp. as the century progressed. It may help to compare Royal and Butter 
Cream icings published in professional texts: 
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>"Royal Icing </b><br>
Beat up well in an earthen bowl with wooden spatulas, 3 lbs. of icing sugar and 8 eggwhites. Add a few drops of aecetic acid, lemon juice or cream of tartar. When partly 
beaten the icing can be used for covering wedding cakes using a rather stiff icing for first coat and a softer icing for second coat so it can be spread nice and smooth. It 
will aquire a nice gloss if dried before the open oven door mouth. For decorating icing continue beating till icing stands up well and can be drawn to points. When icing is to
 be used for decorating with fine tubes the sugar best be sifted or some of the icing can be presssed thru a fine clean sieve. This icing dries quickly and must therefore be 
covered up with a damp cloth or a plaster of paris cover which is soaked in water. Add a little blueing to icing to make it look whiter." <br>

<p> <b>"Royal Icing </b><br>
Take from 3 to 4 egg whites of eggs to 1 lb. XXXX sugar and a pinch cream of tartar. Put in a cake mixer and beat until it stands up well. This icing is used for decorating

Food historians confirm the histories of sweet cakes and confectionery (candies, decorations) are intertwined from the earliest days forward. Both were expensive 
and therefore traditionally reserved for special celebrations. Decorations varied according to culture and cuisine. The earliest decorations were nuts, seeds and 
preserved/candied fruits. Sweet, colored, artfully shaped almond paste (marzipan) traveled with Crusaders from Arab cuisine to European banquet tables. 
<a href="foodcakes.html#dragee">Dragees</a>, 
<a href="foodfaq1.html#gold">edible gold/silver leaf </a>and <a href="christmasfood.html#comfits">
comfits</a> soon followed. Contemporary sugar paste, <a href="foodcakes.html#royalicing">royal icing</a>, and fondant covers first surface in the early 19th century.
<p>
<b>Medieval & Renaissance periods</b><p>
"Comfits came into their own at parties...Several types, including anis vermeil and dragee blanche, are listed amongst items to be bought for feasts in a work on
 household management from fourteenth-century Paris. For those who could afford them, comfits became part of the festivities. Sir Hugh Plat mentioned them in the 
context of several celebratory confections, especially marchepane (a large flat cake of marzipan). He directed that this should be iced with rosewater and sugar, 
and 'sticke long comfits upright in it, cast biskets and carrowies in it, and so serve it; guild it before you serve it'. The habit of making festive marchpanes with icing 
and comfits continued. Shortly afterwards, in the English kitchen, this became the topping for fruit cakes, giving the now familiar form which distinguishes Christmas 
and wedding cakes: symbols of sweetness and status at our most important celebrations. Comfits are now little used on wedding cakes, but the custom did not die 
out entirely. Like so many things to do with sweets, it became mostly for children, and may be the origin of the habit of decroating party buns wtih icing and 
hundreds of thousands. From the artfully sculpted and iced marchepan to fairy cakes turned out by the dozen may seen a slither down the social scale, but it shows 
that even the humblest denizen of the tea-table may have a complex history."<br>
---<i>Sugarplums and Sherbet: The Prehistory of Sweets</i>, Laura Mason [Prospect Books:Devon] 2004 (p. 128-129)<br>
<p>
<b>19TH CENTURY</b><p>
"Icing is one thing, the addition of an almond layer another, and a third is colour and other kinds of decoration on the icing. Early on, when iced plumb cake was already a costly and labour-intensive achievement, further decoration seems rarely, in contrast with the decoration of marchpanes, to have been considered. Hannah Wolley...had, it is true, suggested strewing her 'Cake without Plumbs' with comfits, but this was merely glazed, not iced. Suitable sugarpaste ornaments were even available...But the fifth edition of Mrs. Frazer's Practice of Cookery, Pastry and Confectionery, published in 1806, is the earliest explicit account of cake ornamentation I have found. Having given instructions for icing the cake all over, she continues:
<p>
'If you choose to ornament the cake, put a Crown in the middle, and other small fancy figures on the top; waving small shells up and down the sides of it, and placing within the crown a bunch of artificial flowers of different colours; the crown, figures and shells are of sugarpaste, the flowers and leaves of different coloured paste, and the stalks of lemon peel.
<p>
"Caird, again from the Edinburgh area and clearly reporting commercial practice, followed quick on Mrs Frazer's heels and with a more revealing discussion (1809). After icing 'a high shaped cake, such a s a gato, or 'obelisk', he says,
<p>
'immediately ornamented with spangles, gold and silver leaf, drague, mottoes, nonpareils, rock candies, etc., according to fancy. If for cakes which are flat, the icing is equally spread over them with a spatula, and should not be so think as for the high shaped cake, which cannot be spread so well with a knife. Coats of arms and other emblematical devices are often put on cakes, in which case the icing should be allowed to harden; after which trace the pattern with a pencil dipped in gum water, and gild it with gold and silver leaf, or Dutch metal. The icing is sometimes coloured with the extract of cochineal, lake or carmine, gamboge, etc., by taking a little of the colour and a spoonful of syrup, and pounding them in a small marble, or glass mortar, and mixing it with the icing. Cakes are also ornamented with gum paste in flowers, festoons, trophies, etc., etc. The paste may also be coloured in like manner. The moulds for gum paste, unless very finely cut, do not show so well. A board of various figures, such as leaves, flowers, trophies, etc., will cost about 3 L. The cakes usually ornamented are diet loaves, and formed in a great variety of shapes, as domes, obelisks, steeples, etc.
<p>
"Such cake decoration was clearly an important step, but it was not at this stage directed to bride cake and it was still a long way from any distinctive style of 
decoration for them."<br>

<b>Silver dragees</b><br>
The little silver balls found in our supermaket baking aisles are called dragees. These descend from ancient
<a href="foodfaq1.html#gold">edible silver & gold</a>. The balls are hard sugar covered with a thin layer of edible silver. 
Silver dragees have been used throughout the 20th century for decorating cakes, cookies and the occasional fesitve holiday ham. 
In the USA silver dragees (they can also be gold) are traditionally associated with Christmas and weddings.  The earliest print reference we find for silver dragees is from 1906: "[chocolate] eggs are beautifully decorated with roses, silver dragees and name, in a box."

"Dragee. A French name for a sweetmeat composed of a nut or some other centre coated with layers of hard
sugar. Almonds are the nuts usually chosen; alternative centres are seeds, fruit pastes, or chocolate, and
occasionally liqueurs...Dragees have long been a great specialty of French confectionery. These sweets have
their origin in sugar-coated pills made by apothecaries. However, the original word  'drage' is obscure although
it occurs as early as the 13th century in the archives of Verdun in the north-east of France."<br>

<b>How are they made?</b><br>
"Silver of Gold-Coated Comfits or Dragees.
Various kinds of pan goods can be silver coated, but it is essential that the goods should be well finished and
perfctly smooth before the metallic coating is applied. The silvering or gilding is done in a glass glove, or glass
pan, which is closed with a cork plug. Various solutions may be used for moistening the goods such as gelatin
solution, egg white or a musilage of gum arabic. Care should be taken to ensure that the quality of the gold or
silver leaf employed is of sufficient purity for food products. It is advisable that both types whould be carefully
packed and kept away from direct sunlight or the metallic lustre will be impaired. Put the leaf in the glass pan.
Place the goods in an earthenware vessel and moisten sufficently for the leaf to adhere to them. Over-moistening will necessitate the use of much more metal leaf than is needed, and sill, moreover, detract from
the final appearance of the goods. After the goods have been moistened, pass them as quickly as possible
through a funnel into the revolving pan, then immediately set the pan in motion, adding a few gold or silver
leaves as required, allowing the pan to run until the comfits attain a fine gloss and are well burnished. Metal
coating is a cold process, and should be carried out in a room free from draughts."
