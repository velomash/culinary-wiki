<font color="#003366"><b>Colonial American tavern prices </b></font><br>
Colonial American tavern (publik house, ordinary) prices were set by law. Food was generally
included with the price of room. Urban taverns offered a wider range of services, including both
public and private dining facilties. These establishments offered meals to the general public.
Menus were nonexistant; prices were fixed. <a href="foodcolonial.html#tavernfare">About colonial
tavern foods</a>.
<p>
Pricing notes here:
<p>
"The fare in a rural tavern...was simple, whatever the tavern keeper had on hand for his/her own
family and was willing to share...The prices charged for food (and nearly everything else) in a
licensed tavern were regulated by law. Tavern keepers were even required in some areas to
distinguish between a "good" meal and a "common" one. However, whatever the quality of the
food served, the proprietor was allowed to charge a predetermined price...On December 28,
1785, the day Thomas Allen...opened the doors to his new City Coffee House in New London,
Connecticut, Allen recorded the prices he intended to charge his customers in...his day book.
Breakfast, dinner, and supper were the same price, one shilling and six pence...At Allen, the meals
were seldom as expensive as the drink sold...Dinners in many urban taverns were, following
English custom, offered as "ordinarys"...meaning a prepared meal open to the public offered at an
established time for a set rate...Dishes, in some cases, were passed communally and not available
as individual portions...The Indian King in Philadelphia...offered "a regular ordinary every Day, of
the very best provisions and well dressed at 12d a head...'...Congressman Samuel Read wrote his
wife in 1775:  We sit in Congress generally till half-past three o'clock, and once till five o'clock,
and then I dine at City Tavern, where a few of us have established a table for each day in the
week, save Saturday when there is a general dinner....A dinner is ordered for the number, eight,
and whatever is deficient of that number is to be paid for at two shillings and six pence a head,
and each that attends pays only the expense of the day."<br>

<font color="#003366"><b>A note about wartime food prices: </b></font><br>
Food in wartime is often a precious commodity. Prices are determined by availability and
governmental regulation. During the American <a href="foodfaq5.html#civilwarprices">Civil War</a> inflation was rampant and food was scarce.
 In World War I our federal government established the <a
href="http://www.ecommcode.com/hoover/hooveronline/hoover_bio/food.htm">U.S. Food
Administration</a>, headed by Herbert Hoover. 
<p>
During World War II the Office of Price Adminstration (1942-1945) set the prices of various
consumer goods to stabilize the economy in the United States. <a href="fooddecades.html#40government">Ration books</a> were used to
purchase many items. Most countries involved in WWII also rationed food and regulated prices.
Dates, prices and food items varied according to availability. In 
<a href="foodfaq6.html#40rationingbritain">Great Britain</a> 
food
rationing was the managed by the Ministry of Food. Cookbooks published during war years
provide a wealth of information on prices, menus and rationing.

<b>American Civil War: prices & fluxuations</b><br>
In all places and periods, supply and demand dictate market prices. Retail food price comparisons between the North and 
South during the Civil War are complicated because they had different money and inflation rates at different points during
the War. Context is key.
<p>
Most of the American Civil War was fought on Southern
soil. Historians confirm Union forces specifically targeted Confederate food supply to gain physical advantage.
Transportation blockades (railroads, rivers, ports), suppy reallocation (commandeering forts and merchants inventory) and farm destruction (pillage, burning) proved effective. Food was scarce;
prices rose. Northern food prices reflected lack Southern produce but most folks above the Mason Dixon line were not 
starving. And, of course, seasonal availability was still a consideration. Enter: <a href="foodfaq5.html#bartering">bartering</a>. 
<p>
<b>About food supply in the South</b><br>
"The Confederate-controlled Fort Henry and Fort Donelson protected major agricultural areas in Western Tennessee and well
as crucial railroads and rivers on which provisions were transported withing the Confederacy...Fort Henry fell to Union naval
forces, and the Union army proceeded overland to take Fort Donelson. Despite its strategic location, the garrison at Fort Donelson ran out
of provisions...The effects of these losses were felt as far east as Macon, Georgia, where beef prices went from ten to twenty
cents a pound in a few days...The scarcity of provisions for the arm and the price for food in the marketplace caused concern
throughout the South."
---<i>Starving the South: How the North Won the Civil War</i>, Andrew F. Smith [St. Martin's Press:New York] 2011 (p. 32-33)
<p>
"When food became unaffordable for many Southerns, the Confederate government stepped in and tried to place price controls on various
commodities in the hope of keeping prices down. However, farmers hoarded staples rather than sell them at the artificially
lower prices, resulting in less food on the open market. Price controls were discontinued, but inflation then ran rampant."
---ibid (p. 41)
<p>
"[In Richmond VA] By February 1863 the price of flour had more than doubled. Bacon, which cost $1.25 per pound in 1860, sold for $10, while the price
of sugar increased more than fifteen-fold and coffee cost forty times what it had previously...Rapidly escalating prices encouraged
hoarding and speculation, which drove prices up even more. Since the salaries of soldiers, government workers, and factory 
laborers were fixed--or at least did not rise quickly enough to cover inflation--food became unaffordable."
---ibid (p. 53)
<p>
"[In Atlanta, 1864] food prices...escalated--a pound of butter cost $15, a bushel of potaotes sold for $24, a barrel of flour went for
$250, and one hundred pounds of bacon cost $500."
---ibid 9p. 168)
<p>
"Even before the sieve of Vicksburg commenced, food was a problem in the city. Confederate soldiers engaged in 'the customary
pilfering--fruits, vegetables, chickens, and livestock disappeared; troops drained the sity of supplies, created shortages, adn sent
prices soaring. Food became scarce. Butter sold for $1.50 a pound, and flour was virtually unavailable...Although food was plentiful
outside Vicksburg...plantation owners were often unwilling to sell food to the military authorities, simply because farmers
could get better prices on the open market. Well before the arrival of the Federal army, Vicksburg residents had to drive into
the countryside to purchase salt for $45 a bag and turkeys at $50 each, which were unavailable in the city."<br>
---ibid(p. 99-100)
<p>
<b>[1861]<br>
Prices in the Macon [Georgia] market.</b>--The prices for all leading articles are considerably lower than in any other city, as is
concluseivley demonstrated by the fact that our merchants are daily shipping goods to all the principal cities in this and adjoining
States. Retail country dealers have therefore only to choose whether they will pay the prices demanded by our merchangts and 
thus keep the good share, or let them be sold to other points. Our merchants, so far, have not ran the prices up to correspond
with other cities, and prices have only advanced with the heavy demand. For instance, the single article of Lard Oil is quote in 
New Oreans at from 2.50-3.00 per gallon; it is quoted in our market at from 2.75-3.00 per gallon.<br>

<a name="bartering">
<b>Bartering instead of cash</b><br>
Bartering (trading) goods and services in lieu of monetary payment was common in pre-iundustrial times. It was especially viable
during periods of hardship and war. A farmer could barter grain and vegetables for a horse; a merchant could accept flour for tools, a
cobbler could exchange a new pair of shoes for a winter coat. During the American Civil War, Southerners regularly 
bartered one food for another, or other goods for food. Salt was an especially precious commodity because in times
preceding modern refrigeration, it was used for food curing and preservation. No salt meant no meat during the long months
following traditional slaughtering periods (late fall).
<p>
Bartering transactions are 
excluded from historic pricing data sets because there were no records published
in the newspaper, captured by commercial markets, or reported by the government. Most accounds are anecdotal; found in
letters, journals and diaries.
<p>
"Because of the depreciating value of the Confederate money, and the scarcity of specie, the primitive system of barter came to be
a popular method of exchange late in the war. After early 1864 it was said that bartering had become the 'best mode of getting
supplies, and those who...[had] things to barter fare well.' From 1864 until the end of the war, newspapers carried hundreds of
notices of people willing to exchange one commodity for another. The following advertisement, which appeared in the Savannah
<i>Republican</i>, was typical:
<blockquote> 'I will barter salt from my salt factory for produce on the following terms: Salt, 50 pounds per
bushel; 4 bushels of salt for 5 bushels of corn and peas; 1 bushel of salt for 5 pounds of lard or bacon; 2 bushels of salt for 7 pounds
of sugar; 10 bushels of salt for a barrel of 'super' flour; 2 bushels of salt for 1 pr. of shoes.'
</blockquote>
The acceptance of foodstuffs in return for tuition or board in colleges and schools became general. Forsaking altogether monetary
payments, farmers would load whatever they had to ofer on a wagon or cart and take it around the countryside trying to 
exchange it for what they had not...One woman, once a lady of means, found it necessary to sell her $600 New Orleans-made
bonnet. Instead of money, she took five turkeys in payment."<br>

 A "Food Thru the Ages " project sounds wonderful! Unfortunately, this is not a simple task. 

Determining accurate historic values of consumer goods is a complicated economic process--one

which must factor in regional differences, inflation, labor costs and personal income.
To make

international comparisons one must also study the evolution of monetary systems and foreign

exchange rates. This is why (for example) it is impossible to draw a simple chart of  bread prices

through the ages across all cultures. If you want to compare your local prices from one decade to
another you will need to factor in the <a href="http://www.bls.gov./cpi/home.htm">Consumer
Price Index</a> for your area. Numbers are supplied by the U.S. Department of Labor.

Did you know that in Great Britain that a penny-loaf  was set by law? Karen Hess, culinary

historian, explained "Bread was the staff of life in Tudor and Stuart England, more so among the

poor than the rich.... Its importance was such that the <b>Assizes of Bread</b>, dating from

1266, took upon itself overseeing and pricing of the bakers. The price of the loaf was fixed; the

weight was permitted to fluctuate in compliance with an official table that took into account the

price of wheat and the extent of bolting. The finest regular loaf was the <b>penny white</b>, next the

<b>penny wheaten</b>...and the <b>household penny</b> 100% whole wheat..." (<i>Martha

<p>If you want to make price comparisons in modern times you also have to pay close attention
to changes in weights and measures. Package sizes/weights of popular consumer goods (candy

<b>Delmonico's Bill of Fare, 1830s</b><br>
How much did a meal in New York City's Delmonico's cost and what did they serve? Excellent questions. 
The original 1834 Delmonico's menu (bill of fare or 
carte) was a simple list of basic items. Not quite the extensive gourmet fare history associates with this particular
establishment. The best discussion of this first Bill of Fare is reported in The <a href="delmonico1834.pdf">
"A Menu and A Mystery: The Case of the 1834
Delmonico Bill of Fare,"</a> Ellen F. Steinberg and Jack H. Prost, <i>Gastronomica</i>, Spring 2008 (p. 40-50). 
<p>
<a href="delmonico1838.pdf">Delmonico's 1838 menu</a> was reprinted in the frontmatter of Lately Thomas' book 
<i>Delmonico's: A Century of Splendor.</i> This extensive menu reflects the gourmet glory of Delmonico's exquisite meals 
and wine service. 
Curiously? These menu prices were expressed in British currency. This stuns contemporary researchers expecting
the new United States to eschew all things British. In context, it make perfect sense.
We queried William Grimes, author of <i>Appetite City</i> about this phenomenon.  He was kind to respond with this information: "The US used shillings and pence for quite some time, even after the 
revolution. Hence the cheap restaurants that served "shilling plates." The earliest Delmonico's menus reflect the period 
of transition from British-style coins to the US ones."
 <p>
"Although French cuisine was gaining a foothold, the dominant cooking style in New York was still English, reflected in the profusion of oyster saloons and 
chophouses near the theaters, the markets and the centers of commerce...'Everything is done differently in New York form anywhere else....'...Any innovation that 
smoothed the flow was regarded as pure genius. Haly and Sabin's refectory on Nassau Street introduced the self-serve concept by arranging lighter dishes along a
 large table, allowing customers to pick and choose according to their pocket, their appetite, or their time. 'Here one can graduate  his feeding precisely to his
 appetite, and can luxuriate from a penny's worth of bread and butter up to the full capcity of his purse.' the Tribune reported. 'Warm cakes morning, noon and 
night, good coffee, tea and chocolate, good steaks, etc. pies, cakes, etc. and one may fill with these for a New York shilling.'...For the present, New York's
 restaurants catered to every taste, at every price. In a fanciful sketch in the Broadway Journal in 1845, a 'gentleman in search of dinner' made a comic tour of the 
city's restaurants, driven from one dining spot to the next by a series of mishaps that whittled away at his bankroll of 'a half eagle and two shilling pieces.'...Reaching
 into his pocket to pay for an absinthe at the bar, the hapless gentleman realizes that one of the two shillings he gave the cabman was actually his half eagle. 
Suddenly, dinner at Delmonico's is off. He is now flat broke...Brooklynites who agreed paid a shilling at Bell's for roast meats (beef, lamb, veal or pork) or a shilling
 and a sixpence for roast fowl (chicken, goose, turkey, or duck)."<br>
---<i>Appetite City: A Culinary History of New York</i>, William Grimes [North Point Press:New York] 2009 (p. 62-63, 71,72)
<p> 
"The trend of the prices can be judged from two bills that have survived, rendered to 'J.O. Sargent' in 1840 and 1847, respectively...The 1840 bill was for four
 dinners (plus an incidental charge of 63 cents) at a total cost of $20.76. This works out to an average of about $5.00 per dinner...The 1847 bill was for six dinners,
 at a total charge of $55.50...The average cost for dinner this time was more than $9.00, though this increase might be attributed either to the fact that on two 
occasions, when the bill came to $17.88 and $12.00 respectively, Sargent entertained guests, or splurged on wines. The supplemental charges and costs of wines 
were what could run the check for a Delmonico repast up and up." <br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Breakfast cereal: the Kellogg's Corn Flake study</b></font><br>
Pioneering <a href="foodfaq7.html#breakfastcereal">breakfast cereal manufacturers</a> (Kelloggs, Post, Quaker, Ralston) left an indelible mark
 on American tables. In addition to filling generations of hungry bellies, breakfast cereals provide viable insight into 
our nation's economic situation. How? Prices and sizes of breakfast cereal products reflect dietary recommendations, agricultural surpluses, supply shortages, 
and political purpose. 
We selected Kellogg's Corn Flakes for our breakfast cereal price study because it has survived a century of changing consumer tastes, two World
Wars, price fixing investigations, Stagflation and (now) Agflation. It's one of the few constants in a churning bowl of changing norms.
<p>
<b>About Kellogg's:</b> In the beginning, Kellogg's patented foods were served exclusively to the residents of the Battle Creek Sanitarium. 
According to the records of the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov">U.S. Patent and Trademark Office</a>, Kellogg brand cereals were introduced to the American 
public May 1, 1907. An interesting byproduct of this study was discovering the timeliness of Kellogg's advertising. In the earliest years, 
Kellogg's Corn Flakes were touted for their healthful properties as aids to digestion. During the Great Depression and WWII, 
Corn Flakes were promoted as meat fillers and milk extenders. In the 1950s and 1960s they were familiar, filling, and fun for afterschool and bedtime snacks. During the health-conscious
1970s these unpretentious flakes led the crusade. Ads laid low during the 1980s-1990s, when pre-sweetened cereals prolifertated.  In the 2000s, as we warily watch American corn crops diverted to ethanol production,
 Kellogg's prices rise again. What story will these prices tell 10 years from now?
<p>
<b>About these prices</b><ul>
<li>This not a comprehensive scientific study. We selected one price for each year from various major US newspapers.  
<li>All prices were published by 
major supermarket chains. We puposely excluded prices published by drug stores, department stores, and discount clubs. 
<li>Many years there were several prices 
and different sizes. 
<li>To align these prices we recommend you calculate, whenever possible, the price per ounce.

<b>Prohibition-era cocktail prices [1920-1933]</b><br>
"...illegal booze was expensive and most drinkers--female or male--could not afford to consume alcohol at preprohibition rates... 
overhead expenses were immense. The costs associated with intercepted shipments (lost either to rivals or to law enforcement 
agents), hired thugs, police payoffs, chemists, distillery workers, ships, trucks, and production equipment all mounted up-- 
so those in the traffic charged plenty. In Northern cities, cocktails that sold for 15 cents in 1918 were 75 cents by the early 
1920s. Domestic lager beer, which sold for about $10.50 a barrel in 1918, cost anywhere from 15 cents to $1 or more a 
quart by 1930 (that is, $160 or more a barrel, depending upon the quality of the beer). Domestic spirits, which averaged $1.39 
a quart in 1918, soared to an average of $4.01 a quart by 1930. Prices on imported foreign beverages also rose 
significantly...no doubt a large quantity of American made liquor was passed off as imported to fetch higher prices." <br>

provide seasonal profit. The ordinary saloons in the southern section of New York offered cut whisky at 25 cents a drink, with the 
house buying every third potion. In the 'smoke shops' of the lower East Side and Hell's Kitchen, on the west, the usual

<b>Setting new prices, Prohibition repealed, 1934: </b><br>
"Washington went shopping for its liquor yesterday. With repeal effective, liquor stores were crowded. Buyers who looked around 
found a great variation in prices, sometimes as much as $1 and more a bottle. Prices generally were lower than those charged in 
Maryland stores. With repeal getting off to a slow start when it actually became effective at midnight Thursday, business 
picked up yesterday and the cocktail hour found drinking places jammed and stores doing a big business. Night clubs and restaurants, 
which did a slow business during the two yours between midnight and 2 a.m. yesterday, were jammed last night as thousands 
celebrated...For the most part, crowds were orderly. Yesterday police made 13 arrests for drunken driving--not an unusual day. When 
Government offices closed at 4:30 p.m. crowd flocked to the liquor stores, which had sprung up overnight in the downtown district, and 
in some places overflowed into the streets. Stocks were not plentiful...In all, 175 liquor stores had paid their license of $750 apiece 
to sell packaged alcoholic wares of all kinds. Not all of them were ready for business. Customers repeatedly were told that their 
favorite beverages were not available but would be in a day or two...most Washington drinkers were keeping up their habit of buying 
liquor and drinking it at home. Public drinking was strange and new to most of the customers. While most of the buyers were men there 
were a number of women in the crowds...Few quotations were available on wines and champagnes, because there was none 
available. Domestic wines sold as low as 89 cents a fifth. The price in Maryland is $1.10. Dixie Belle gin was selling at one of the 
cheaper Washington stores at $1.19 a quart, as compared with $1.90 in Maryland. Hennessy brandy varied greatly. One store was 
charging $4.95 a bottle. In another, bottles with the same labels were selling at $3.85. Tom Hardy blended rye sold as low as 
$1.19 a pint in one store, and in another it was $2.85 a quart. The Maryland price is $1.20 a pint. Crab Orchard straight Bourbon whisky sold here 
as low as $1.19, as compared with $1.40 in Maryland...At one of the higher priced stores, the following prices were quoted on 
popular brands if blended whisky by the quart...Four Roses, $3.80...Some of the liquor stores were selling bottles containing 
somewhat less than two ounces of blended whisky, at from 20 cents to 25 cents a bottle. This seemed to be a particularly popular 
item and thousands of bottles were sold to customers seeking a novel way of serving drinks. In one Fourteenth street store more 
customers were buying little bottles, at 23 cents each, than anything else...Cocktail prices ranged from 25 cents to 40 cents. Whisky 
by the drink was selling from 15 cents for the blended variety to 25 cents for bonded goods. Club prices and restaurant prices were 
lower than the old speakeasy rates. The Press Club was charging 25 cents for gin bucks, rye highballs and Manhattan and Martini 
cocktails. Straight drinks of blended liquor were as low as 20 cents and 40 cents was being charged for bonded rye and imported

<b>How much did strawberries cost in the USA 1856?</b><br>
Back in those days strawberries were seasonal and many people grew them at home. Our survey of historic USA newspapers confirms fresh strawberries were sold in urban markets late spring/early summer. In 1852 the crop was poor and prices were high. Think: supply and demand. Below please find an article published in the New York Times in 1856. It provides amazing details on the size of market, consumer price points, and business outlook. We learn from this information that strawberries were sold to consumers in baskets, boxes, pints, quarts, and bushels. 
"Strawberries are the Arcadian dainties with which mother earth blesses us once a year. In their blushing ripeness, they are both pleasant to the eye and grateful tot eh taste. More than this, they are the most healthful of all fruits. Everybody knows how they great Linnaeus cured himself of the gout by freely feasting on them. We presume that all the New Yorkers are afflicted with the gout just now, as the Summer days approach, and are eager to improve the botanist's remedy....New York City is the largest strawberry market in the world, and the strawberry grows in all climates and is sold in all latitudes. It is estimated that fifty thousand bushels of this delicious fruit were sold in this City during the season of 1855, while about twelve thousand bushels were sold in Philadelphia, twelve thousand in Cincinnati, and ten thousand in Boston. During one week last season, more than 400,000 baskets were received daily in this City. From one port in New Jersey, twenty five miles distant, we received by steamboat on a single day, 200,000 baskets. The largest receipt of strawberries by railroad on a single day, that we remember was a load of 893 bushels, or 142,000 baskets, brought in by an evening train on the Erie railroad, a few years since. New York City received last year from all sources, not less than 8,000,000 baskets of strawberries. The value of those, at the wholesale price of 2 1/2 cents the basket, was $2000,000, for which the consumer probably paid double that sum. The size of a strawberry basket is about 'the size of a piece of chalk.' Five baskets were supposed originally to make a quart. But as, like baker's loaves, they become each year small by degrees and beautifully less, it would be hazardous for us to assert how many of these infinitesimal units will make a quart this season. We know of no reason why strawberries should be sold in these thimble measures.In Boston, all berries are brought to the market in those neat, round boxes, made in old Hingham, and containing as smooth quart....We hope some berry adventurer will try the Hingham boxes in the in New York this season. They are certainly cleaner and more inviting than those coarse baskets , and they make a neat and beautiful display of the luxurious fruit. About fifteen hundred acres of choice land, in the vicinity of New York, are required to supply this market with strawberries. Some farmers cultivate thirty and forty acres for this purpose. The average crop form one acre runs from thirty to fifty bushels. Some cultivators have succeeded in gathering, occasionally, one hundred, and even one hundred and thirty bushels from an acre. ..The cost of cultivating the berries, is estimated at $20 and $25 the acre, with the additional expense of $1.50 per bushel for picking. The prices obtained for the fruit by the cultivators range form 12 1/2 cents to $1.50 the quart. The latter price has been paid in Washington City for the earliest berries raised in that vicinity. It is probably that the nature of the strawberry and its cultivation is not yet thoroughly understood. A crop of 30 bushels an acre is about equal to a corn crop of 10 bushels on the same ground, which, as every farmer knows, is a very poor product. If our farmers understood the nature of the strawberry as well as they understand the nature of corn, they could easily raise 300
 bushels on an acre as 30. Then these delicious berries would be cheaper and more abundant every year."

<b>Who "invented" this product?</b><br>
"Campbell's Soups were developed in the 1890s by Dr. John T. Dorrance, a chemist from Philadelphia. Dorrance earned his PhD at the University of Gottingen in Germany, then stayed on 
in Paris to learn about French cooking, especially soup making. Meanwhile, Dr. Dorrance's uncle, Arthur, was a partner in Joseph Campbell's Camden New Jersey, canning
company...Dr. John T. Dorrance turned down offers of professorships from Cornell, Columbia, and Bryn Mawr to work with his uncle in the canning industry, not
 only because of the lucrative salary his uncle offered, but because he had developed an idea while
studying in the kitchens of Paris. He believed that condensed canned soup would be a very attractive product for three basic reasons: it was less expensive to ship, it took up less
shelf space, and it was infinitely more convenient. Campbell's tomato soup was introduced in 1897 and was instantly popular...And at just 10 cents a can, 
Campbell's Soup cost one-third as much as ready-to-eat soup....The distinctive red and white label--inspired by Cornell University's school colors, was introduced in
 1898..."<br>

Tracing price histories for specific products (even ones as famous as Coca Cola and Pepsi) can be
a complicated project. Why? Point of purchase (vending machine, grocery store, restaurant, army
PX?),  product size (10 ounce cans, 8 ounce glass bottles, 2 litre plastic bottles), and economic
factors (sugar availability) all play significant roles. Most products do not maintain a uniform
presence throughout the years. Unless the company itself has conducted such a study, the best
you can do is approximate. If this is the case, base your study on price per ounce rather than
container.

<b>A note about canned soda:</b><br>
Coca cola began selling its products in cans in 1940, two years after the first soda in cans (Cliquot
brand ginger ale) went to market. Our research indicates these cans cost 5 cents each. About
Coca Cola in cans:
<p>
"Coca-Cola had tested their product in cans as early as 1940. They tried a 16-ounce and 32-ounce
cone top can with a red, green and white logo that read "canned specially for use at home and on
outings." Coca-Cola began selling cans to overseas armed services in 1955 and, in 1959, test
marketed cans in five U.S. cities. By 1960, however, it was Royal Crown that was selling the
most canned soft drinks. Inspired by the new competition, Coca-Cola began using and promoting
cans on a large scale soon thereafter. The soft drink maker even introduced a new label design
specifically for their canned product called the "Harlequin" which featured a pattern of diamonds
and proved popular with consumers."<br>

"Five-cent soda pop like the nickel candy bar, soon may become as rare as the whooping crane. From New York to San 
Francisco one of the most staunchly held price lines in U.S. economic history is now crumbling rapidly. That's the keynote of shop 
talk being swapped here this week by 1,000 pop bottlers gathered for a convention of the American Bottlers of Carbonated 
Beverages. It's a matter of moment to 150 million Americans. Last year they guzzled 24 billion bottles of pop. All bottlers are divided into 
three groups these days--those who've already raised prices to six, seven or ten cents a bottle and those who want to boost 
prices but haven't quite worked up enough nerve; and a smaller fraction who are trying to hold the line. Higher production 
costs are squeezing them all...'This may be an evolution instead of a revolution, but prices of soft drinks are sure to go up like 
everything else has since the war. The nickel is obsolete...Places like Chicago and New York are almost universally selling soft 
drinks for 7 to 10 cents a bottle. It's just like the 5-cent phone call that now costs 10 cents in many places...The score pad to date...shows 
a patchwork price pattern across the United States. In many cities in the state of Washington, soft drinks cost a dime a bottle. 
Philadelphians pay 7 cents while folks in Colorado Springs shell out 6 cents. In New York they're liable to pay anything 
from a nickel to a dime...Key to the price problem is the amount that bottlers charge retailers. For as long as most bottlers-- 
or their fathers--can remember, the price has been 80 cents for a case of 24 small bottles. At that price, a retailer grosses 
$1.20 a case by selling the bottles at 5 cents each...The cost increases which nag the bottlers are many. They begin with the 
syrups or concentrates that bottles buy from the manufacturers, such as Coca-Cola, Nehi, Seven-Up, Pepsi-Cola, Dr. Pepper and 
Mission Orange. Syrup prices are tied to the price of sugar--and raw sugar now sells at $6.25 a hundred pounds in New York. The 
pre-war 1939 aerate in New York was less than $3...Bottlers also have to calculate such costs as labor, bottles, cases, 
delivery trucks, tires, gasoline and machinery...'Coca-Cola does 50% of the soft drink business. It has the tremendous 
advantage of its volume of sales as well as having only a six-ounce bottle. Thus, it can sell at 5 cents long after we can,' 
says G.R. Fitzgerald, sales director of the B-1 Beverage Co. of St. Louis. 'They are putting a lot of dealers out of business 
with their 5-cent price.'..Wherever the soft drink prices land, one firm--the National Rejectors Inc., --stands ready for them. 
It's displaying here a device for bottle-dispensing machines that can answer almost any coin-changing problem you can put to 
it. A buyer of a six-cent soft drink...can deposit a penny and a dime in the machine and get a nickel back. Or he can insert 
a dime and receive four pennies. Or a penny and a quarter will bring him four nickels."---

"The price of a glass of Coca-Cola rose five cents at many soda fountains here. In Atlanta a spokesman for Coca-Cola Co., said the 
increase was prompted by some New York wholesalers who last week boosted the prices they charge for a gallon of Coke syrup to 
$2.25 from $2. He said Coke itself hasn't changed the prices. For many New Yorkers the step means they'll be 
paying 20 cents for a small glass of the soft drink instead of 15 cents, and 30 cents for a large glass instead of 25 cents."---

check old newspapers for grocery store advertisements. Your local public librarian can help you
identify/obtain old newspapers. Large national papers (<i>New York Times</i>) contained food
advertisements in the early years. These are searchable via databases.

<b>Great Depression vs. WWII</b><p>
"Nickel candy bars still cost a nickel. But their cost has soared since CU last tested them in 1939. That's a paradox only until you
examine the facts. The paradox vanishes with the words, "hidden price rise." Here's an example of how the hidden price rise works
for candy bars. Let's say you are in the habit of buying Mars' <i>Forever Yours</i> candy bars. Chances are that you haven't noticed
any appreciable difference in bars you've been buying for the past four years. But had you --like CU--saved the labels, here's what you'd
find: in 1939 your nickel bought four ounces of <i>Forever Yours</i>. Now the nickel bar weighs ony 2 1/4 ounces. In other words,
if you bough the candy bar by weight, they way you buy sugar, you'd be paying almost 9 cents instead of 5 cents for a four-ounce bar.
The sad truth is that price ceilings of candy, as set by the General Maximum Price Regulation last March, have not halted the boosting
of prices. And the Office of Price Administration recently tried--and failed--to get a permanent injunction against Mars, Inc., because
the company had reduced the weight of its candy bars 11 per cent last May. The Federal Cout judge who heard the case ruled that
"slight reductions" in weight of candy bars sold in March did not constitute a violation of OPA regulations, and therefore he dismissed
OPA's application for an injunction. OPA is appealing the case; unless the decision is reversed, price control will be seriously
threatened. 
<p>
<b>Reduction in Weight</b> CU's survey of prices and weights of popular brands indicates that reductions in the weight
of candy bars have been far from "slight." CU was able this year to buy 20 of the kinds of candy bars studied in 1939. of the whole
assortment, <i>Tootsie Rolls</i> were the only ones that hadn't shurnk in size. A two-ounce <i>Tootsie Roll</i> used to cost 5 cents; it still
does. But the other bars which were tested then and now showed a hidden price increase averaging around 23 per cent. CU's analysis
of candy bar prices revealed some other interesting facts. The least expensive of the rapidly disappearing milk chocolate bars
in the present survey--aside from the six-ounce bars priced at two for 25 cents (which CU hasn't found in the stores for several
months)--was Hershey's 3/4-ounce bar. These used to cost three for 5 cents; not many stores sell them for a straight 2 cents each,
and some, for 3 cents each. At 2 cents they are a good buy. Their cost per ounce is 2.7 cents, compared with 3.1 cents per ounce
for <i>Peter's</i> ( 1 5/8-ounce bar), the lowest priced 5 cents bar CU found, and 3.3 cents for <i>Hershey's</i> 5 cents (1 1/2-ounce) bar.
Puffed milk chocolate bars were found to be more expensive than unpuffed bars of either the same or competing brands. But for utter
extravagance in candy buying CU cites the penny bar. <i>Hershey's</i> penny bars of milk chocolate cost from 6.3 cents to 
6.7 cents an ounce. As for milk chocolate with almonds, <i>Aero</i> (made by Hershey) was both the best buy and the worst, 
depending upon how it was bought. The 5 cent bar was comparatively cheap, costing 3.3 cents an ounce; the penny bar, on the other hand,
 cost 10 cents an ounce. CU's shoppers found that there was no abundance in the stores of any kind of candy bars. The supply varied
from day to day, as evidently most retailers sold out one shipment long before the next one arrived."<br>

This year was special for McDonalds. Not only was the company celebrating 20 years of business, it was opening new restaurants
worldwide. In the USA, basic McDonald's 
hamburgers cost 30 cents (<i>Daily Mail</i>, Hagerstown MD, May 1, 1975). Several USA newspapers confirm
McDonalds celebrated its 20th birthday April 20, 1975 by selling hamburgers at original price: 15 cents. McDonalds pricing in 
foreign countries is yet another matter. Newspapers reporting 1975 Hong Kong launch stated "Items are priced quite 
comparably to those in America: the equivalent of a 32 cents for a regular hamburger and 70 cents for a Big Mac." ("Big Mack a 
Smash in Hong Kong," <i>The Capital Times</i> [Madison WI], October 25, 1975 (p. 3). McDonalds also splashed that year in
London's Piccadilly. "Golden Arches on the European Horizon? A cheeseburger and tea? 'le big mac' on the Champs Eylsee? McDonalds
has come to Europe...Nexst Saturday, McDonald's opens officially its second fast-food shop in Britain...Until the appearance of McDonald's the avaiability of pure-beef American-style hamburgers here had been limited to the 
recent wave of chic, crowded and expensive hamburger joints such as the Hard Rock Cafe, the Great American Disaster and Yankee
Doodle. Compared with the $1.50--or higher--price for such elegant burgers, the basic sells in London for 45 cents, about the same
price as as the less Americanized hamburgers sold in the 600-ship Wimpy chain. McDonald's Golden Arches Restaurant Ltd. gets is beef
patties made to order by a British meat company. A baker in the English Midlands makes the rolls. But the cheese has to be imported
from Germany, the milkshake mix from the Netherlands, the potatoes from Canada and the pickles from New York." ("The Big Mac in Piccadilly
Circus?" Barbara Crossette, <i>New York Times</i>, April 13, 1975 (p. 62)

"Plans by the McDonald's Corp. to lower its hamburger prices by a nickel drew plaudits
Monday from the president's chief inflation fighter, who said it would save the firm's
customers millions of dollars. The firm said it would do its part to fight inflation by
instituting a 10 percent cutback in prices of its regular hamburgers and
cheeseburgers at its company-owned stores. Effective Tuesday, hamburgers will drop
from 43 to 38 cents and cheeseburgers from 48 to 43 cents." <br>

"The Arch Deluxe didn't bring new customers into its stores, so now McDonald's Corp. appears poised to try something old -- price cutting.
The fast food company will pitch a new promotional price-cutting scheme to its franchise operators in a video teleconference today. According to Dick Adams, the
 head of an association of McDonald's franchisees, the company has been "trying to convince its franchisees that it's the right way to go for a couple of weeks."
The bait designed to lure customers through the golden arches is a 55-cent Big Mac, available only if purchased with a soft drink and french fries, menu items that 
yield relatively high profit margins. Normally the Big Mac sells for $1.90. At the new price, when a customer orders a small drink and small fries the franchisee 
would only break even, said Adams"<br>

Single hamburgers are not on the menu in our local McDonalds (Cedar Knolls, NJ). Hamburgers are bundled with a
Happy Meal. 2 Cheeseburgers are specially bundled; not for single purchase. [In store visit, June 11, 2013].

Contact your public library and historical society and ask about the availability of old newspapers,
store ledgers, menus, and personal diaries. Be specific. Tell them which date(s) and place(s) you
need. Your librarian can confirm availability or direct you to the closet holding library. If you are
a teacher/scout leader assigning this project, please call ahead to alert the librarians you class is
coming. This is a great project for students who have not yet had the pleasure of looking through
old microfilm. Your librarians many also have other sources they can gather and have waiting for
your student. If your library does not have old newspapers, your librarian can help identify which papers were
published in certain towns for a specific time period.  She can usually borrow the paper
(on microfilm) for you. This is especially helpful if you are compiling prices for another city, as is
often the case with birthday and anniversary presents. <p>
<b> Please note</b>: finding local historic food prices is a great project, as long as you can be
flexible with the food items. Why? Prices in newspaper ads reflect seasonal availability,
popular demand, company promotion, and product surplus. Some products rarely go on sale (a
bag of Hershey's Kisses), making their prices almost impossible to track. If you want to compare
food prices based on newspapers ads you will have the most success if you stick with the basics:
bread, butter, ice cream, steak, bacon, eggs, cereal, soda, canned vegetables, grape juice, oranges,
etc. Don't waste your time scanning through weeks of microfilm looking for one specific brand.
Pricing is competitive; store/generic brands are always a little cheaper than national brands. It also
makes sense to pick a week (first week in May?) to deflect the seasonal nature of food pricing.

[1938]</b><br>
"Berlin...Lotteries and bookmaking are legal in Germany, one in which everybody with a healthy appetite places at least two bets every day, is the 
food lottery. Coffee and rolls are a sure thing for breakfast, but anybody will give odds on what he will get for the two other
meals. Those to whom eating is a pleasure, as well as a necessity, no longer ask themselves: 'What shall I eat today?' but
mentally speculate: 'What can I get today?' Nomads who eat in restaurants, and know the headwaiter's first name, and
tourists need not take the food gamble so seriously. A restaurant menu usually has enough suggestions to make the average customer
forget what he intended to eat. Schlichter's, where I ate the other night, offered twenty-six fish and meat dishes as
specialties in addition to steaks, chops and a hundred other regular items...If present conditions continue long enough, the 
home-loving Germans, certainly the city dwellers, will be transformed into a race of diners-out. Those who have the responsibility
for filling the home pots and pans are the hopeless addicts in the daily food gamble, as an extract from a housewife's diary
shows: 'Sunday--half a lemon decorated my grilled flounder at the hotel--such extravagance--and every order in the dining room
was enough for a starving stevedore, naturally much of it uneaten and wasted; tomorrow we start housekeeping. 'Monday--At
breakfast we decided on pork chops for dinner. None of the neighboring shops had pork, but one did produce two small, not too
juicy beefsteaks...Vegetable trays had only green beans, kohlrabi and green peppers. No sho had onions or lard...
'Tuesday--Bought three eggs, which a girl clerk had apparently had hidden behind the counter. A woman wanted two pounds of fresh 
green beans which were inside the store, but the proprietor, arrogant since people must take what they can get, said she could
not have them until the stale ones outside were sold. Got some lamb chops, the first I've seen, and the stores had stew beef
and pork which can be boiled in sauerkraut. 'Wednesday--Tried to get more eggs but was told there would not be any until next
week, if then... the city was out of onions...[and] garlic...'Thursday--Found a small grapefruit...to vary the usual
peaches, plums, and grapes...Also good tomatoes and lettuce for salad, which appear about twice a week...The [store] proprietor...
made sure that we would not feed [rice] to our dogs before he would sell a pound. He sold me two oranges, though his orders were 
to sell the German apples first. 'Friday--Good fresh fish for dinner but shopped in vain for lemons, Brussels sprouts, red cabbage, 
green beans and carrots on the trays...still no onions. 'Saturday--One store had a leg of lamb for roasting, and others
had a supply of beef and pickled pigs feet. Windows of those handling smoked meats are full of hams and countless varieties
of sausages, but cold lunches become monotonous. All had green corn in husks, an idea from America, but at caviar prices. A 
dissapointment when cooked, for it was field corn, tasteless and woody. 'Sunday--Ate in a restaurant and from the way they are 
crowded most of Berlin must be dining out...In Berlin the early bird at the weekly market or stores gets the chops, if there
are any...Some days they cannot get pork, an other days it may be mutton or another staple. Butter and lard already are 
rationed, and talk is that the police will issue cards for meat before the Winter is over. Each adult is allowed half a pound
of butter and as much lard, each week, if there is any lard. Each ration card is good at a designated store. The supply of
adulterated butter is sufficient...Peacetime rationing of meat and other foods, if it goes further, might have unpleasant
results. Little if any of the supply is wasted now, as stores rarely have any which is not sold, and the thrifty German, at present
prices, is not buying more than absolutely needed. Most Germans always have bought from day to day. Few have ice boxes. In
Germany, not only meat but almost all vegetables, fruits and other foods are sold by the pound. An American pound is 9-10ths of a
German pound and a dollar is worth 2.49 5/8 reichsmarks. Store prices of a few typical articles (per American Pound unless stated
otherwise) are: Beef tenderloin, 68 cents; beef pot ropast, 36 cents; soup beef, with bone, 31 cents; soup beef, boneless, 
43 cents; hamburger, 38 cents; goulash veal, 45 cents; pork tenderloin, 54 cents; pork kidneys, 38 cents; mutton chops, 41 cents;
boiled ham, 65 cents; chicken, 45 cents; smoked eel, 86 cents; head cheese, 36 cents; liver sausage, 65 cents; Summer salami, 70
cents; coffee, $1.08; bread, 8 cents; butter, 58 cents; fresh tomatoes, 8 1/4 cents; lettuce (head), 4 cents; green corn, 
9 1/3 cents; green string beans, 9 cents; princess string beans, 14 1/2 cents; dry onions (peck), 51 cents to 
$1.13; cabbage, 4 cents, mushrooms, 26 cents; eggs (dozen), 60 cents;...peaches 18 cents; pineapple (one) $1.80; cantaloul, 68 cents;
bananas, 18 cents; grape fruit (one) 20 cents; cream (quart), 41 cents; sugar loaf 16 cents; sugar, pulverized, 14 cents; 
apples, 16 cents, German Camembert, 36 cents...These prices are for the American or other foreigner who lives in Germany and who
pays 40 cents for a reichsmark. The also are the prices for the German whos basic wage is between $17.50 and $26.50 in a
week of forty-four hours. Pay of skilled workers is higher and, with the present shortage of labor for industrial and urban
construction, may work two shifts a day...Germany never grew all the food it needed, and the balance must be imported...Gresh foods from neighboring contries 
always supplemented what the home farmers grew, and now Germany has cut down on food imports. The excuse is that the country 
needs its foreign exchange to import war materials. True or not, that is what the people believe and tell each other."<br>
