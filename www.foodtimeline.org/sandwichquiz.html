</b></font></center>
<p>
John Montague, the 4th Earl of Sandwich, "invented" the <a href="foodsandwiches.html#firstsandwich">first sandwich</a>
 in 1762.
By the 1920s, USA recipes proliferated to the point where entire cookbooks were devoted to this topic. Incorporating
popular ingredients in novel ways, "modern" women were clearly experimenting with flavor, texture, and presentation. 
Trendy new foods (pineapple, canned tuna) are embraced as well as traditional fare (ham, sardines). Today's cooks marvel
at this decade's fascination with cream cheese, food choppers and white bread. 
<p>
The recipes below are from <i>Seven
Hundred Sandwiches</i>/Florence A Cowles [Little, Brown:Boston] 1928. Ms. Cowles notes in her introduction: "One's imagination
likes to play with the astonishment and lively interest the sporting earl would manifest could he see the development his
invention had undergone since then and its evolution from a hasty improvisation into a thing of art and intricacy. For the sandwich...
has become both complex and compound...it has gained in popularity by gigantic strides. Some branches of the now numerous
sandwich family have risen in life and put on airs...they bloom exotically at afternoon teas and receptions...There is a constant
and insistent demand for new ideas in sandwiches, new combinations in fillings and new and attractive architectural plans for
construction...the origin of many of the recipes has become shrouded in obscurity...in this book will be found represented
practically every kind of sandwich thus far invented." (p. v-vii)

We salute the sandwich makers of the 1920s with 20 interesting samples. Can you guess by the name what the ingredients are?

"Use alternate rounds of white and whole-wheat bread, diminishing in size as in the Russian Club Sandwich. Each round is buttered. The bottom round is of whole wheat and is spread with a mixture of cream cheese and jam; this is the dessert course. The next round (white bread) is the salad course, spread with tomato and water cress with a little mayonnaise. The meat course is a slice of chicken on a round of whole-wheat bread.

<a name="beefjelly">
<font color="#003366" size="+1"><b>Beef Jelly Sandwich</b></a></font><br>
"Cook together two medium-sized beef hearts, four pigs' feet and one medium beef tongue, seasoning with salt and pepper. Remove
meat from broth and cut in slices; remove the meat from the pigs' feet. Arrange in brick pan alternate layers of each, pour over the
broth to cover, let cool and keep in ice box. The feet and tongue will make a jelly that will keep the loaf firm. Slices of this
make good sandwiches. A little vinegar may be sprinkled over it if a pickled sandwich is preferred. This will keep indefinitely." (p. 30)

"Baked beans 'as is' make an excellent sandwich, if mashed and spread smoothly on buttered bread, white or whole-wheat. Or

different but equally palatable sandwich." (p. 124)

oyster in a slice of bacon, sprinkle with the green pepper, then fold and fasten with a toothpick. Place in moderately hot frying
pan. Have a platter in the warming oven and as each piece of bacon is fired a crisp brown, place on platter. Spread slices of bread lightly
 with mustard or any other mixture you prefer, then place the bacon between, removing toothpicks. Do not salt the oysters, as the 
bacon is salt enough." (p. 73-74)
