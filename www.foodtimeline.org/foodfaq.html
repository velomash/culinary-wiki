<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Algae</b></font><br>
Algae, seaweed, nori, kaiso, agar agar, miuk, carrageen, Irish moss, spirulina, tecuilatl: vitamin rich edible gifts from the sea.
Consumed from prehistoric times forward, culinary applications depend upon place/period/people. 
Algae as human food deserves special consideration because it serves both ends of the human
culinary spectrum: starvation food and culinary art. Fascinating!
<p>
"The earliest archaeological evidence for the consumption of algae found thus far was discovered
in ancient middens along the coast of Peru. Kelp was found in middens at Pampa, dated to circa
2500B.C...In Africa, another species of cyoanbacteriium, Spirulina platensis, grows abundantly in
Lake Chad and is collected, dried, and made into sauce. It is widely consumed by the Kanembu
people...In China, the earliest reference to algae as food occurs in the <i>Book of Poetry</i> (800-600B.C)...The Greeks and Romans apparently disliked algae and, seemingly, made no use of them as
human food, although they were used as emergency food for livestock...The seaweed Rhyodymenia
palmata was eaten in Iceland as early as A.D. 960, according to the Egil Saga...In Japan, the eating of
algae is also an ancient practice. Seaweed was apparently eaten
by the early inhabitants of Japan, as it had been found with shells and fish bones at human sites in
the Jomon period (10,500-300 B.C.) and the Yayoi period (200 B.C. to A.D. 200). In
AD 701, the emperor established the Law of Taiho in which seaweed...were among the marine
products paid to the court as a tax. The blue-green bacterium Nostoc verrucosum, currently
known as ashitsuki nori, was mentioned in <i>Man Yo Shu</i> by Yakomichi Otomi in the oldest
anthology of 31-syllable odes dating to A.D. 748."<br>
---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kenneth F. Kiple & Kriemhild Conee Ornelas, Volume One
(p. 231-233)
<p>
<b>[Japanese nori & kaiso]</b><br>
"The Japanese liking for nori can be traced back as far as the 8th century AD; and by the 17th
century it was being cultivated in some of the inlets and estuaries which abound on the Japanese
coasts..."<br>
---<i>Oxford Compantion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 539)
<p>
"To make the naori-maki the core material is placed on a bed of rice which is then rolled up in
nori seaweed. It was created around 1820, though there had been a few kinds of rolled sushi prior
to that. It probably appeared first in the elegant vegetarian cooking associated with Zen temples.
Nori-wrapped sushi may have simply been an improvisation, or it may have been made for
the meals served after Buddhist wakes and funerals, when no fish was eaten."<br>
---<i>The Book of Sushi</i>, Kinjiro Omae and Yuzuru Tachiban, forward by Jean-Pierre Rampal
[Kodansha International:Tokyo] 1981 (p. 50)
<p>
"Nori. Laver Porphyra...The red algae asakusa nori (Porfyra tenera) is the best-known species. When it is gathered, it is dried into
sheets of a standard size....which are packed in bundles of ten. This nori is toasted and used as wrapping for normimaki. The
sheets are also further cut up and packed in different sizes, often in cellophone envelopes of five toasted sheets suitable for
wrapping around mouthfuls of rice at breakfast. This is called yakinori, or ajitusuke nori, when the small pieces are caoted with
spicy flavouring. Another nori is green laver, anonori...which is dried and sold in small flakes to sprinkle on food. It grows
on rocks in dark areas lapped by the tide. Hiteogusa has a better flavor than aonori, and is made into tsukaduani, sold as tsukadani
of nori or amanori...Aonori is one of the traditional ingredients of schichimi togarashi, but the cheaper aosa...sea lettuce, 
is often used as a commercial subsitute."<br>
---<i>A Dictionary of Japanese Food</i>, Richard Hosking [Charles E. Tuttle:Rutland VT] 1996 (p. 110-111)
<p>
"Kaiso (Seaweed)
Found throughout the country, although Tokushima's is considered the best, wakame (a type of seaweed) is harvested May to June.
Fresh, it is used in sunomono (vinegared food), suimono (clear soup), and in dashi (stock). Dried wakame is also commonly used,
inluding ran-boshi, dried unpretentiously on the nearest beach; shio-boshi-wakame, washed in salt water and dried; or shio-nuki-wakame,
washed only in plain water (with no salt) and dried. Nori (sea laver) is best known in its dried and toasted form as the outer
layer of nori-maki (sushi wrapped in nori). Small sheets are used to scoop up rice mixed with raw egg in a typical ryokan 
breakfast. It is often added to soba and ramen dishes (mainly in Kanto), mixed with salt and sesame for use in furikake (a
savoury topping sprinkled on plain white rice), and is an ingredient in shichimi-togarashi (seven spice mix). The role of konbu/kobu
(kelp) in Japanese cooking cannot be underestimated, as it is a key ingredient in dashi. Ma-konbu, growing to almost 2m in length
is harvested from Hokkaido's Uchiura Bay, where it is also known as yamadashi-konbu. From the northern island of Rebun, rishiri-konbu
is excellent for dashi, while that from Shakotan peninsula is not as aromatic so is used mainly in tsukudani (fish and vegetables
simmered in shoyu and mirin). Hijiki is a black, spiky looking, but soft, seaweed. It is good sauteed in shoyu with soy beans,
a dish called hijiki-mame."<br>

<b>[Korean miuk]</b><br>
"Miuk-Kuk. Seaweed Soup. In Korea, for three weeks after the birth of her baby, the mother is made to drink this soup four or
five times a day. The seaweed is supposed to be good for recover--it cleans the blood, makes the hair glossy and black and is full
of calcium and iodine. But often young mothers become tired of this before the three-week period is over and I have seen many a grandmother
scolding and trying to force a young mother to drink this soup. This soup is often served on birthdays, perhaps to remind one
of the day he was born. When this is served, someone often asks, 'Whose birthday is it today?" <br>
(5-6 servings)<br>
6 oz. seaweed (miuk)<br>
6-2/3 oz. lean beef<br>
1 green onion (cut into thread-like strips)<br>
3 tablespoons light soy sauce<br>
1 teaspoon minced garlic<br>
1 teaspoon gound sesame seed<br>
1 1/2 tablespoons sesame seed oil<br>
1/3 teaspoon pepper<br>
Chemical seasoning<br>
1) Wash and soak seaweed in water, drain and cut into 1-2/3 in. lengths.<br>
2) Cut beef in thin and narrow strips, mix with garlic, ground sesame seed, 1 tablespoon of sesame seed oil, pepper, cook 
over fire until meat 
changes colour. Then add seaweed and 1/2 tablespoon of sesame seed oil and cook for five minutes.<br>
3) Whe the seaweed is cooked, add 6 cups of water and bring to boil. Add green onion and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes. 
When the seaweed
 becomes tender add soy sauce, and chemical seasoning. Bring to boil again and remove from fire.<br>
* When using fresh seaweed, do not cook with the meat but add to the soup after it is brought to boil.<br>
* Clams may be substituted for beef with very satsifying results."<br>

<b>[Irish carrageen]</b>
"Carrageen (Chondrus crispus), also inown as Iberian moss, Irish moss, pearl moss, or sea moss, this green or purplish mucilaginous, 
edible seaweed is common on many coasts of northern Europe and the U.S. In Ireland it is dried, bleached, and used as a 
vegetable, as a jellifying agent, and for the making of moulds and aspics, It has a very high vitamin content, and is processed and
marketed commercially in Irleand, as well as being exported."<br>

New York Times Book Co.:New York] 1976 (p. 81)<br>
[NOTE: recipe for carrageen jelly is included. Happy to scan/send if you want.]
<p>
"Carrageen moss, found on the rock at low tide, was much used along the coast. Boiled in milk it made delicious jellies 
and blancmanges. It was said to be very nutritious and a folk cure for colds and chest ailments, as it contained iron. In 
lean times in Donegal the freshly gathered carrageen was washed and boiled in water and given to calves to supplement their
food."<br>

<b>[Aztec  spirulina]</b><br>
"Perhaps the most famous lake produce used and widely traded by the Aztecs was the edible algae
(Spirulina geitleri).  Tecuilatl, which is very much like mud or slime, grows in certain places in the
lake basin of Mexico on the surface where it is collected or swept up by nets, or heaped up by spades.
Once taken up and dried a bit in the sun, the Indians shape it into small cakes and put it out in the sun
on fresh green leaves so that is becomes perfectly dry. It is then kept like cheese...It is eaten when
necessary with toasted maize or with the ordinary tortillas of the Indians. Each source of the slime has
its owner, some of whom were as much as a thousand gold escudos a year. It tastes like cheese, and
that is what the Spaniards call it, but less pleasing and with a certain taste of mud. When new it is
green or blue, when old it is mud color, green verging to black, edible only in very small quantities, in
place of salt or as a condiment to maize. As for the tortillas which are made of it they are a rustic
food, which is proved by the fact that the Spaniards, who avoided nothing that would please the
palate in these countries, have never brought themselves to eat it. (Hernandez 1959, 2: 408-9)'"<br>

"The mention of edible algae...leads us to another resource that was fully exploited. Seaweeds were
harvested and eaten fresh on the coast or dried into sheets or blocks and traded into the highlands. This
cochayuyo consisted of many different genera: Poryphyra in the south of Peru, Gigartina Ulva lactuca,
Durvillea antarctica, and others in the north. Fresh-water algae were also consumed, blue-green algae
of the genus Nostoc being eaten raw or processed for storage. In postconquest times Nostoc was made
into a dessert by being boiled with sugar."<br>

<a name="agaragar">
<b>[Agar Agar]</b><br>
"Called Agar-agar' in the past, agar is a gelatin obtained from seaweed-especially seaweeds belonging to the genera Euchema and Gelidium. It has reportedly been used in China since 
A.D. 300, and perhaps somewhat later in Japan (where it is called kanten). Many kinds of jellied sweets that are sold in tropical Asia retain their firmness because of agar, which is 
employed to thicken other foods as well. Agar also finds its way into vegetable dishes and salads and, in addition, has a 
number of medical uses."<br>
---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kenneth F. Kiple & Kriemhild Conee Ornelas [Cambridge University Press:Cambridge] 2000, Volume Two (p. 1715)
<p>
"Agar-agar, the Malay name for a gum which was discovered in Japan. The name originally applied to a mucilage extracted from a red seaweed...Agar-agar is the most powerful
 gel-former of all gums, owing to the unusual length of its carbohydrate molecules. Agar-agar gels are unique in withstanding temperatures near boiling point. They are thus ideal for 
making jellied sweet dishes in tropical climates, without the risk of their melting or sagging, and for aspic coatings...The method of purifying kanten by freezing and thawing is said to 
have been discovered accidentally by a Japanese innkeeper during frosty weather in 1658. Since then the product has gained widespread popularity in Japanese cuisine not only 
for making jellies by also as a general thickener for soups and auces...During the 19th century agar-agar was imported by 
western countries for making desserts."<br>

<a name="allspice">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Allspice</b></font><br>
Allspice is a "New World" berry with "Old World" flavor. Why the name? Allspice tastes
like a combination of cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg. It is not a commercial spice mix invented as a shortcut.
<p>
"Unlike most spices (which are indigenous to the tropics of southern China, southern India and the East Indies), allspice (Pimenta dioica) is 
a berry of the New World, native to the West Indies and Central America. A member of the myrtle family, allspice was used ty the Taino
and Carib Indians (and quite possibly also by those of the Mesoamerican mainland) long before the Europeans reached the Americas. The
small, aromatic, tropical tree and its berries were among the many early 'discoveries' of Spanish explorers, who mistook the pea-sized
berries for peppercorns. In fact, even today the Spanish word pimenta refers to allspice. The Spaniards introduced the spice into 
Europe in the sixteenth century, and in both whole and ground forms it has subsequently become a part of the cuisines of many
peoples across the globe. Allspice, which begins as a purple berry but turns brown when sun-dried, acquired its English language
name because of its versatility: Its taste is like a combination of nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove. It is best
in sweet and savory dishes and is used frequently in mulled wines and for pickling, not to mention in fruitcakes and spice cakes."<br>
---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kenneth F, Kiple & Kriemhild Conee Ornelas [Cambridge University Press:Cambridge]
2000, Volume Two (p. 1716-1717)
<p>
"Allspice. Named from the supposed resemblance of  its  hot aromatic smell and taste to the
combined savours of cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg, allspice is the dried, unripened berrry of a
West Indian tree, Pimenta dioica, of the eucaplytus family (a discovery of Christopher
Columbus). It was first mentioned in English by Robert Burton... (1621), and it became a popular
spice in succeeding centuries, easily imported from Britain's Caribbean colonies. The berries can
be used either whole or ground, and it is equally at home in sweet or savour dishes. It has gone
by other names in its time. Jamaica pepper dates from the mid-seventeenth century, but is no
longer heard. More confusingly, it has also been called the pimento (in reference to its Latin
name), although it has no connection at all with the red capsicum to which the term pimento is
now generally applied."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 4)
<p>
"The English name allspice was given to the spice because its flavour resembles a mixture of
other spices, especially cloves and black pepper...The allspice tree belongs to the myrtle
family...when Spanish explorers encountered the plant in Jamaica at the beginning of the 16th
century, they thought that the berries resembled those of the pepper and gave them names such as
'Jamaica pepper' and 'pimento' (from pimienta, the Spanish word for peppercorn)...The
popularity of allspice varies considerably by region. It is used extensively in N. America; and
much more in N. than S. Europe."<br>

<a name="ambrosia">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Ambrosia</b></font><br>
Did you know ambrosia has two meanings? It is the food of the gods and a popular 20th century
American
dessert. Some history on both:
<p>
<b>Food of the gods</b><br>
"Ambrosia. The food of the gods in classical mythology. The term may mean food in the narrow
sense of eatables, in which case it is the counterpart of nectar, the drink of the gods; or it may
mean food in the wider sense of sustenance, when it embraces drink also. What the gods were
actually supposed to eat is a matter of conjecture. In the English language any especially delicious
food may be called ambrosia; but this usage has become uncommon."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
14)
<p>
"Nectar and ambrosia, in the myths, were the foods of the gods, foods that preserved their
immortality and that flowed miraculously in some mythical paradise. Oftentimes, world trees grew
in paradise and produced these divine foods.  The supernatural Tree of Buddha, the haoma tree (a
sacred vine of the Zoroastrians), and the Tree of Life in many lands all produced immortal
sustenance.
     People in many early cultures believed that their deities ate special foods unknown to humans:
The gods were immortal, and they must have consumed something that made them so...Some
writers described nectar as a drink made of honey and fruit, and ambrosia as a kind of porridge
made from honey, fruit, olive oil, cheese, barley, and water. Others described ambrosia as an herb
that grew on earth (some identified it as parsley or wild sage), an herb they believed prolonged
human life just as the ambrosia of the gods preserved their immortality. But it was generally
believed that mortals would suffer deadly consequences if they ate the gods' ambrosia or drank
the gods' nectar, whatever those divine foods might be..."<br>

 [ABC-CLIO:Santa Barbara] 2000 (p. 158)<br>

<p>
"Ambrosia and nectar, food, drink and other supplies of the gods. In the Iliad the gods use
ambrosia as soap and perfume, and fed their horses ambrosia eidar  ambrosial (or perhaps
immortal) food'. It is by means of nektar and  desired ambrosia', distilled into his breast, that
Achilles is protected from exhaustion by Athene, at Zeus's urging. It is with ambrosia and red
nektar that Patroclus' and Achilles' bodies are preserved from decay after their death. According
to Hesiod the gods eat nektar and ambrosia. Sappho tells of the gods' mixing-bowl, krater, filled
with ambrosia to drink. Other early poets, too, seem to regard ambrosia as the liquid or nektar as
the solid or simply do not specify."<br>

<b>American dessert</b><br>
"Ambrosia. A dessert made from fruits, sugar and grated coconut, most popular in the
South.."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New
York] 1999 (p. 5)
<p>
Culinary evidence confirms three points:<ol>
<li> Recipes specifically titled ambrosia begin to appear in American cookbooks in the last quarter
of the 19th century. <li>Prior to this time there were several recipes that would produce
somewhat similar results, listed under different names: iced oranges. The key ingredient that
separates these from "true" ambrosia is cocoanut. Mariani tells us that dried coconut meats were
known to American cooks at least since 1830 and that in the early part of the twentieth century
they were extremely popular. <li>There are many variations of the recipe for ambrosia. 
</ol>
<b>Sample recipes:</b>
<blockquote>
<br>
[1877]<br>
"Six sweet oranges, peeled and sliced (seeds and as much of the core as possible taken out), one
pine-apple peeled and sliced (the canned is equally good), and one large cocoa-nut grated; alternate
the layers of orange and pine-apple with grated cocoa-nut, and sprinkle pulverized sugar over
each layer. Or, use six oranges, six lemons and two cocoa-nuts, or only oranges and cocoa-nuts,
prepared as above."<br>

"Oranges, bananas, cocoanut, pineapple, Malaga grapes, dates, nuts.
Slice bananas and cut in small pieces the other fruits, removing the seeds from grapes. Put a layer
of each until the dish is filled. Then cover the top well with grated cocoanut, and a few nut
meats."<br>
---<i>Uncooked Foods</i>, Eugene Christian (p. 185)<br>
[NOTE: this author was a major health food proponent in his day]
<p>

"Peel and slice a dozen tart oranges, and grate cocoanut; put a layer of oranges in the bottom of
a large glass dish, sprinkle thickly with powdererd sugar, then scatter a layer of cocoanut, another
layer of oranges, sugar and cocoanut until your dish is full; cover the top with cocoanut, ornament
the dish by putting leaf-shaped sections of the peel round the edge; put them on before the last
layer of the orange so that they will be held in their place, and let them curl over the side of the

The classic American recipe for ants on a log calls for celery, peanut butter and raisins:
<a href="http://www.uky.edu/Agriculture/Entomology/ythfacts/bugfood/bugfood1.htm"> Ants
on a log</a> (& other "buggy" recipes). Some recipe variations substitute cream cheese or some a
commercial cheese spread for the peanut butter.
<p>
<b>Who invented "Ants on a log" and when?  Excellent questions!</b><br>
<a href="foodfaq.html#celery">Celery</a> and raisins were eaten (but not necessarily together!)  by people living in ancient times.
<a href="foodsandwiches.html#aboutpeanutbutter">Peanut butter</a> was invented at the very end of the 19th century. Each of these foods [alone or
combined] are considered healthy.
<p>
Celery, raisin, and nut salads were brought to our country from Germany. These were very
popular in the late 19th century (the famous Waldorf Salad). They were mixed with mayonnaise.
Small, bite-sized stuffed vegetables became very popular in America at the same time. Stuffing
was usually some type of cheese, but could also be anchovy paste and other *exotic* fillings. You
will find more details in <i>The American Century Cookbook</i>, Jean Anderson [Clarkson
Potter:New
York] 1997  (p. 17). Dr. George Washington Carver combined peanuts and celery in the 1940s,
though his recipes were limited to <a

<p>
Historic American cookbooks confirm the American practice of stuffing celery began in the early
20th century. It remained popular through the 1960s. Most of these celery stuffings were
soft cheese (cream cheese, soft cheddar) topped with spices (paprika, curry). Some old recipes
include nuts and raisins, though none quite describe the finished "ants on a log" we know today.
Peanutbutter fillings surface in the early 1960s.
<p>
According to the old cookbooks, stuffed celery was served as an appetizer (or hors d'oeuvre) at
the beginning of a meal. People of all ages enjoyed this food at dinner parties, family get
togethers, and holiday meals. Stuffed celery was also served as to children as snacks. Why? It was
healthy and easy to prepare.
<p>
Where does ants on a log fit in? Truth is, we don't exactly know. Some magazine and newspaper
articles from the 1980s  attribute this food to the Girl Scouts, but they don't give a year or
publication. Dozens of
Web sites confirm this recipe is popular with Girl Scouts, but provide no history. We asked the
Girl Scouts of America to confirm. This is what they said:
<p>
" That recipe is indeed found in Girl Scout cookbooks as far back as 1946. However, there is no
mention of
raisins in any of the cookbooks. The recipe is called "celery sticks." I found no mention of it being
called
"Ants on a Log."

Food historians tell us sauces made with <a
href="fruit.html#apples">apples</a> and related recipes
[stewed apples, apple pudding] were made by medieval European cooks. These sauces could be
made from tart to sweet and were served as accompaniments to a variety of foods. In early times,
they were called by different names, often with regards to its use as sauce for meat. The
applesauce recipe in  Elizabeth Raffald's <i>Experienced English Housekeeper</i>
(London:1769) is titled "To make Sauce for a Goose." (see below for recipe). The <i>Oxford
English Dictionary</i> traces the first use of the word applesause in print to Eliza Smith's
<i>Compleat Housewife</i>, 9th edition, [London:1739].  Many 18th century British and
American
cookbooks contain recipes for applesause, confirming its popularity. 
<p>
<a name="porkapplesauce">
<b>Why combine pork & applesauce?</b><br>
The practice of combining pork and apples dates back to ancient times. Hannah Glasse, an 18th
century English cook book author, instructs her readers to serve roast pork with "some good
apple-sauce." The pairing of <a href="foodcandy.html#lambmint">lamb and mint sauce/jelly</a> follows the same principle.
<p>
"Most of the dishes made with apples that we know today are of early origin. For example, to
cook apples with fatty meats, so that their sharpness offsets the fat, is a practice which dates back
at least as far as classical times when Apicius gave a recipe for a dish of diced pork with
apples...the versatility of apples was already being exploited in medieval times; the <i>Forme of
Cury</i> and the <i>Menagier de Paris</i> (14th century cook books) give a range of recipes for
apple sauce, fritters, rissoles, and drinks."<br>

30-31)
<p>
"Apicius' [Roman, 1st century AD] recipe for 'minutal matianum', a ragout of pork, contains
apples...this is a kind of dish still made and eaten, particularly in Northern and Central Europe.

<b>ABOUT APPLE BUTTER</b><br>
Food historians generally credit people of German descent (particularly the Pennsylvania Dutch and Moravians) for
introducing fruit butters to our country. In addition to southeastern Pennsylvania, it is traditionally associated with 
the Appalachian region, especially West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina. According to the <i>Dictionary of Americanisms</i>, the
first mention of the phrase "apple butter" in print (which often lags several decades behind the
actual use of the term) is 1774: "We often make apple butter." This recipe is also known as boiled
cider applesauce.
<p>
"Apple butter, A Pennsylvania-Dutch cooked fruit puree, dating at least to 1765, made by
cooking and pureeing apples with cider."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New
York] 1999 (p. 10)
<p>
"While most Pennsylvania Dutch pickles were designe to humor the meat, preserves were generally intended for some type of Heemgebackenes
(homemade baked good), eaten with the meal as a fruit substitute. Among these, the principal "sweet" condiment (if it had sugar in 
it at all) was apple butter, called Lattwaerrick in Pennsylvania Dutch. Lattwaerick is derived from the German Latwerge, which in 
turn stems from the Latin electuarium. Lattwaerrick is bound up wtih old medical connotations, for electuarium comes from the 
Greek eleigma, and internal medicine. During the Middle Ages, and even into the sevententh century, preserves cooked to a paste
consistency and containing sugar were considered medicines in Germany. Thus, they were the province of the apothecary shop, as 
amply demonstrated in the old Sauer herbal. On the vernacular level, this attitude lingered in rural Pennsylvania into the 
early nineteenth century. Blackberrry jam, for example, was a standard medicine for gallstones."<br>
---<i>Sauerkraut Yankees: Pennsylvania Dutch Foods & Foodways</i>, William Woys Weaver [Stackpole Books:Mechanicsburg PA]
2nd edition, 2002 (p. 152)
<p>
"And while apples came from England, there's no doubt that the German Rhinelanders (and
Moravians) who came south into the Blue Ridge and Cumberland country in the 1700s really
honed apple butter-making to a deliciously fine art."<br>
---<i>Smokehouse Ham, Spoon Bread, & Scuppernong Wine: The Folklore and Art of Southern
Appalachian Cooking</i>, Joseph E. Dabney [Cumberland House:Nashville TN]1998 (p.
398)<br>
[NOTE: This book has more information and two recipes]
<p>
The earliest recipe we have for apple butter comes from <i>The Kentucky Housewife</i>, Lettice
Bryan, 1839: <br><blockquote>
<b>Apple butter.</b><br>
Cider for apple butter must be perfectly new form the press, and the sweeter and mellower the
apples are of which it is made, the better will the apple butter be. Boil the cider till recuded to one
half its original quantity, and skim it well. Do not use for this purpose an iron kettle, or the butter
will be very dark, and if you use a brass or copper kettle, it must be scoured as clean and bright as
possible, before you put the cider into it, and you must not suffer the butter to remain in it a
minute longer than is actually necessary to prepare it, or it will imbibe a copperish taste, that will
render it not only unpleasant, but really unhealthy. It is best to prepare it lage in the fall, when the
apples are quite mellow. Select those that have a fine flavor, and will cook tender; pare and
quarter them from the cores, and boil them in the cider till perfectly soft, having plenty of cider to
cover them well. If you wish to make it on a small scale, do not remove the apples from the cider
when they get soft, but continue to boil them gently in it, till the apples and cider form a thick
smooth marmalade, which you must stir almost constantly towards the last. A few minutes before
you take it from the fire, flavor it highly with cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves, and when
the seasonings are wll intermixed, put it up in jars, tie folded paper over them, and keep them in a
cool place. If made in a proper manner, it will keep a good more than a year, and will be found
very convenient, being always in readiness. Many people who are in the habit of making apple
butter, take it from the fire before it is boiled near enough. Both to keep it well, and taste well, it
should be boiled long after the apples have become soft, and towards the last, simmered over
coals till it gets almost thick enough to slice. If you wish to make it on a large scale, after you
have boiled the first kettle full of apples soft, remove them from the cider, draining them with a
perforated ladle, that the cider may fall again to the kettle, and put them into a clean tub. Fill up
the kettle with fresh apples, having them pared and sliced from the cores, and having ready a
kettle of boiling cider, that is reduced to at least half its original quantity; fill up the kettle of
apples with it as often as is necessary. When you have boiled in this manner as many apples as you
wish, put the whole of them in a large kettle, or kettles, with the cider, and simmer it over a bed
of coals till it is so thick, that it is with some difficulty you can stir it: it should be stirred almost
constantly, with a wooden spaddle, or paddle, or it will be certain to scorch at the bottom or sides
of the kettle. Shortly before you take it from the fire, season it as before directed, and then put it
up in jars."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Apricots</b></font><br>
<b>Origin & early diffusion</b><br>
"Apricot...was long viewed as kind of plum--and one that came from Armenia. In truth, it is a sonte fruit (or drupe) of the same family as the peach. plum, almond, 
nectarine, and cherry and apparently originated...in China, where it has beeen cultivated for some 5,000 years. From China, the apricot traveled by way of northern
 India, finally reaching the Near East. After this, both Alexander the Great...and, later, Roman legionnaires are credited with carrying the fruit to Europe. From 
Greece and Rome, apricots spread throughout Europe, and the Spaniards introduced them to the New World."<br>
---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kenneth F. Kiple & Kriemhild Connee Ornelas [Cambridge University Press:Cambridge] 2000, Volume Two (p. 1720)
<p>
<b>Chinese apricots</b><br>
"Apricots (Prunus armenaica.) are found wild or spontaneous in certain mountainous areas of Central Asia centered on the T'ien Shan, and in many parts of 
northern China, as well as in Korea and eastern Siberia...De Candolle...after reviewing the evidence, concluded that China was the apricot's place of domestication, 
and some present-day botanists agree. The symbol for apricot is found among inscriptions on the Shang oracle bones (18th-12th century B.C.)...The apricot is also
 mentioned in various of the Chinese classics as an ornamental and fruit tree; and, like the peach, it was believed to possess magical powers...The apricot, like the 
peach, seems to have been late, around the beginning of the Christian era, in reacing Greece and Rome...laufer...has suggested that possibly it arrived in Iran in the 
second or first century B.C., then spread westward by way of Armenia, which led to its Greek name and ultimately its species name, armeniaca. At least one 
observer believed the wild apricot is indigenous to the Himalyas of India's Punjab, but this is a minority view among botanists of India."<br>
---<i>Food in China: A Cultural and Historical Inquiry</i>, Frederick J. Simoons [CRC Press:Boca Raton FL] 1991 (p. 220)
<p>
<b>New World introduction</b><br>
"The Apricot reached Virginia in N. America early in the 18th century, but the
climate of the eastern states is not fully suitable. The Spaniards had earlier taken the fruit to Mexico. It was from there that its cultivation
spread to California duirng the 18th century."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxfcord University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 25)
<p>
<b>Why call it apricot?</b><br>
"The apricot has an involved liguistic history. The Romans called it praecocum, literally 'the precocious one', because of its most welcome
habit of ripening in early summer, before the peach or the plum. Byzantine Greek borrowed the word as berikikken, and the Arabs took it over as
birquq. The Moorist occupation passed it to Spanish, along with the definite article al, 'the', and Spanish albarocoque has since spread to
other European languages. The fruit was introduced to England from Italy in 1542 by Jean Le Loup, Henry VIII's gardener, and so probably the
Italian form albercocco is the immediate source of the earliet English versions of the work, abrecock. Modern English apricot developed from this
fairly quickly...the-cot ending comes from French abricot, while the substitution of apri- for abri-may be due to an erroneous linking of the
word with Latin apricus, 'sunny'...In British English...the first syllable of the word is pronounced as in the word ape, whereas American English
tends to prefer the pronunciation found in the first syllable of apple."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002  (p. 9)
<p>
<b>Symbolism & mythology</b><r>
"Symbols of [apricots] appear on oracle bones of the Shang dynasty, from the eighth to the twelfth centuries B.C...Ancient myths commonly place
apricots in paradise. These "golden apples" grew abundantly in the Holy Land, and scholars therefore have argued that apricots, not apples, hung
from the biblical Tree of Knowledge...In Babylonian myth, after the creation of the world, when a worm begged the sun god Shamash for food,
Shamash offered him apricots. Apricots seemed a fitting food for a sun god to possess; they were golden like the sun, and their sweet aroma typified
the smells associated with celestial deities. Some ancient people believed the apricot to be a prophetic or oracular tree, and decidedly magical. In
China, Confucious compiled some of the most imporant religious books of China in an apricot grove...In Chinese mythology, the apricot was one of
the five renowned fruits of antiquity, along with the plum, peach, the jujube, and the chestnut."<br>

Food historians confirm artichokes descended from their wild cousins <a href="foodfaq.html#cardoons">cardoons</a>. While the wild variety
was consumed in ancient times, modern artichokes, as we know them today, first surface during the Medieval ages. 
These "Old World" vegetables were <a href="foodfaq.html#americanartichokes">introduced to America</a>
 by European settlers.
<a href="foodfaq1.html#jerusalemartichokes">Jerusalem artichokes</a>, a "New World" food related to sunflowers,

<b>What are artichokes and how long have we been eating them?</b><br>
"Although at least three vegetables are called artichokes the globe or French artichoke...has little relationship to either the 
Jerusalem artichoke or the Chinese artichoke. This is fortunate, because there is confusion enough created by the numerous varities
of the globe artichoke grown around the world. ..The artichoke appears to have originated in North Africa (where it still exists in 
a wild state). It subsequently became a wild thistle in Sicily, where its bitter leaves as well as its flower heads were 
gathered for food. The Greeks and Romans began its cultivation."<br>

"Artichoke [Cynara scolymus], a member of the thistle family. The cultivated globe artichoke is
an improved form of the wild cardoon...which is a native of the Mediterranean region with a
flower head intermediate in size and appearance between artichoke and common thistle. The true
artichoke may have evolved originally in N. Africa, although some have suggested Sicily as its
birthplace. It is first mentioned as being brought from Naples to Florence in 1466...In Italy, the
very young wholly edible buds have long been eaten just as those of the cardoon were in classical
times. They may be deep fried (Carciofini alla Giudea) or pickled. At a slightly later stage, but
before they bracts become really tough, the heads may be stuffed; this is a popular dish in Arabic
cuisine, which strongly favors the stuffing of vegetables. Sometimes the young stems and leaf
midribs are cooked and served like any other stem vegetable. After the artichoke became
established, it enjoyed a vogue in European courts, and had a reputation as an aphrodisiac. In
modern times it has become more commonplace, and is relatively cheap in S. Europe, where it
thrives...The British do note eat artichokes much. Nor are they generally popular in the USA,
although they are grown in California and commonly eaten wherever French influence persists,
as in Louisiana. In France...Gros Vert de Laon...enjoyed a high reputation until the latter part of
the 20th century..."<br>

found in the wild state. Poor people there pick the thistle they call korchef to enrich the sauce for
their couscous. This kind of thistle was also the ancestor of the cardoon, a specialty of Provence
and part of the traditional Christmas supper there...The Italians make an apertif from artichokes
which is good for bile, but the principal use resides in the bitter leaves, from which a medicament
is also extracted."<br>

"Thousands of years ago, wild artichokes grew on the hills of Greece, Egypt, and parts of Asia.
Some scholars have identified these as globe artichokes, the vegetable familiar to people today;
others as cardoons, the artichokes' predecessor. Cardoons are wild thistles with sharp prickles on
the ends of the leaves. Ancient people familiar with these plants consumed the last flower buds in
salads, stews, and soups. Artichokes are one of the world's oldest cultivated vegetables, grown
extensively in Greece and Rome. They were highly esteemed in Tudor Englnad, and the British
exported them to other parts of Europe. Yet, however edible these wild "thistles" may have been,
the ancients certainly recognized the symbolic implications of the sharp leaves. When the Bible's
Job contrasted prosperity and usefulness with cruel suffering, he did so by metaphorically
contrasting thorns and weeds with wheat and barley--in other words, thistles, which caused pain
and suffering, with grain, which brought happiness and prosperity...In one myth, a beautiful
young girl named Cinara angered a god, who turned her into an artichoke. Although the gods
often changed humans into plants to honor them and reward them with immortality, the
transformation of Cinara was clearly a punishment."<br>

improved the artichoke during Europe's Dark Ages and introduced the new version into Muslim-controlled parts of southern
Italy. During the Renaissance, the improved artichoke became highly prized, first in Italian and later in French cookery. Artichokes were
also introduced into England at this time...Globe artichokes, also called French artichokes or green artichokes, were grown in 
Virginia as early as the 1720s and in New England around the time of the Revolutionary War, when they may have been introduced by
allied French soldiers. Instructions for growing artichokes regularly appeared in gardening books beginning in 1806...Before the 
Civil War, artichokes often appeared on the tables of wealthy Virginia planters...Artichokes were grown in California and Louisiana in the 
eighteenth century but were not a successful commerical crop. In the 1890s, Italian farmers in northern California's Half
Moon Bay planted the crop, and beginning in 1904 boxcar loads of artichokes were sent east from California to supply the needs of

"The globe artichoke is actually the bud of a giant thistle. The plant itself is a decorative one, as anyone who has seen the acres
 of them along the coast around Half Moon Bay knows full well. Almost all commercially grown, artichokes come from this 
region, and from there they are shipped to all parts of the country. Artichokes, when first introduced to California, were a
flop, too many people being of the opinion that they were more trouble than they were worth. The Italians, of course, knew better, but
only because they knew so well how to cook them. Finally the Palace Hotel, in San Francisco, started to feature artichokes, and
they immediately became very much the mode. Today they are standard fare, from Seattle to San Diego."<br>

"Mrs. Helen Evans Brown, authority on Golden State cookery, tells us that artichokes were slow to catch on widely when they were 
first cultivated in California. Italian-Americans, whose forefathers were eating artichokes in 1400 AD, persevered in growing
them in the one district in the United States ideally suited to them--the foggy area south of Fan Francisto along Half Moon
Bay. The famous Palace Hotel in San Francisco had a hand finally in popularizing artichokes, at leasta on the West Coast. Mrs. 
Brown says that the vegetable long has been served there, appearing on a menu as early as 1879 as 'artichokes barigoule.' That term puzzles
home cooks, for a thousand and one recipes for artichokes barigoule exist, each a bit different one from the other. The Larousse
Gastronomique, French dictionary of the table, explains that a la barigoule may be applied to any stuffed artichoke. The word may
derive, some think from brigoule or bourigoule, a mushroom of the Midi, used in stuffing artichokes in that region. Mrs. Evans' daptation of the 
Palace's artichokes bsarigoule, circa 1880, follows. The recipe provides a pleasing first course at dinner or a nice lunch or
supper dish.

(a tablespoon lemon juice or vinegar to a quart of water).<br>
2. 'Half-fry' the bacon, drain and mince. Combine with the shallots, mushrooms, parsley and seasonings to taste. <br>
3. Drain the artichokes upside down, then stuff them with bacon mixture. Tie a string around each.<br>
4. Heat the oil in a flame-proof baking dish. Brown artichokes in it. Add stock, cover and bake in a moderate oven (350 degrees
 F.) till artichokes are tender when the bottoms pierce easily with a fork. Remove strings.<br>

<b>Cardoons</b><br>
"Old World" cardoons are wild varieties of the cultivated<a href="foodfaq.html#artichokes"> artichoke family</a>. Physical resemblance and similar culinary properties sometimes cause confusion.
Italian immigrants are generally credited for introducing this interesting edible to North America. 
<p>
"Cardoon, Cynara cardunculus, a member of the thistle family, a native of the 
Mediterranean region with a flower head intermediate in size and appearance between 
artichoke and the common thistle. Long before the artichoke was developed, the ancient 
Greeks and Romans regarded the cardoon as a great delicacy. It was first described in the 
4th century BC by the Greek writer Theophrastus, who stated that it was a native of 
Sicily. (Probably it was originally introduced from N. Africa.) Not only the flowering 
heads but also the stems and the midribs of the main leaves were eaten. Young buds were 
pickled in vinegar or brine with silphium and cumin. The cardoon remained popular 
through the Middle Ages and continued to appear in English cookery books through the 
18th and into the 19th century, but in recent times cultivation and consumption have been 
greater in N. Africa and S. Europe than in W. Europe." <br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 
(p. 137) 
<p>
"The cardoon is, like its close relative the globe artichoke, a member of the thistle family. 
It is cultivated for its leaves, and particularly for their (fairly) succulent stalks, which are 
blanched by earthing up in much the same way as celery. English acquired the word from 
French cardon, which is a derivative of French carde, meaning edible part of an 
artichoke'. This in turn came ultimately from Latin cardus or carduus, thistle, 
artichoke'...English word chard comes from the same source. First mention of cardoons 
in English comes in Randle Cotgrave's Dictionary of the French and English Tongues 
(1611)..." <br>

"Cardoon, cardo, gobbo...is a cultivated version of the wild cardoon...from which cultivated artichokes also derive. With the fleshy 
leaf stems, spines, and strings removed, cardoons can be eaten raw, with various sauces, or cooked in different ways. In the past, 
raw cardoon were held to make a healthy end to the meal, dipped in salt and pepper, freshening the mouth and improving the taste 
of wine, as well has having aphrodisiac properties. Seasoned with the Bagna Cauda of Piedmont, they would nowadays be eaten raw 
at the beginning of a meal. Their mild bitterness can be enhanced with butter and parmesan, or olive oil, after parboiling in 
water, or the prepared stems can be stewed in stock." <br>

United States but were never much appreciated save by Italian-Americans, in whose

"Asparagus is the young shoot of a curious, almost leafless plant, Asparagus officinialis, of the lily 
family. There are several other Asparagus spp, native to various parts of the Old World. The wild 
form of A. Officinalis grows in marshy places in Europe, e.g. in Poland and Russia. In the cultivated 
form, selective breeding and special growing techniques have combined to give a greatly thickened, 
fleshy shoot which has been prized as a delicacy since ancient times...The early Greeks are not known 
to have cultivated the plant, but the Romans grew asparagus in their gardens from quite early times, 
as Cato and Columella attest. By the first century AD Pliny the Elder could describe asparagus spears 
grown at Ravenna, in heavily manured soil...After the fall of the Roman Empire, asparagus 
cultivation continued in Syria, Egypt, and Spain, with help from the Arabs who occupied all these 
countries. Eventually it arrived in the main part of Europe: France before 1469 and England by 1538. 
Cultivation was well below the standard reached by the Romans...Asparagus was not grown on a 
large scale in N. America until the latter half of the 19th century. During the same period it was 
spread to China and the Malay peninsula by European influence...The asparagus of Argenteuil, near 
Paris, enjoyed great fame from around 1830, when a certain M. Lherault-Salboeuf began to introduce 
improvements in asparagus growing. These led to giant blanched stalks...The quest for even larger 
stalks resulted, by the 1930s..." <br>

shoots). In fact, this in only one twist in the contorted history of the word asparagus. Its ultimate 
origins are not known, but it first appears in ancient Greek, as asapargos. Latin borrowed this as 
asparagus, but in post-classical times this became abbreviated to sparagus, which was the basis of the 
anglicized forms sparage and sperage current in the sixteenth and early seventeenth 
centuries...Around 1600, the original Latin form asparagus began to become more familiar, and 
within a generation the abbreviated sparagus had replaced the earlier sparage and sperage." <br>

yielded sweeter varieties. The Greeks likely cultivated asparagus by 200 B.C. and held the 
vegetable in high esteem...People all over Europe found uses for asparagus. They used the plant 
not only for eating and drinking but for making bridal garlands and for weaving baskets used 
in the Greek harvest festival...This may have had some connection to the phallic shape of the 
emergent asparagus shoots and their subsequent role in myth and symbol. The Greeks 
dedicated asparagus to Aphrodite, the goddess of love, and to Perigune, a goddess of the 
cornfield, who hid behind a bush of asparagus to escape her wicked father." <br>

"I have already mentioned the alleged aphrodisiac properties of the various edible stems and 
shoots which were all grouped together as asparagus' in classical antiquity. They may have 
acquired their reputation from the fact that asparagus is particularly rich in phosphorus and 
vitamin A, as well as oxalic acid. The belief is a tenacious one, and that witty nineteenth-century gastronomic writer Stanislas Martin claims that husbands who strayed could be caught 
out by their wives in this way for asparagus had the drawback of giving the urine an 
unpleasant odour, which has more than once betrayed an illicit dinner.'" <br>

Food historians generally agree that aspic and other glazes were first used in the 18th century.
  They are considered part of classic French cuisine. The practice derived from medieval gellys
  (jellies). Notes here:
  <p>
  "Aspic. The name for a clear savoury jelly used for holding together or garnishing cold meat or fish
  dishes, has an uncertain derivation and dates back only to the late 18th century, when it meant
  the whole dish not just the jelly element. Aspic is properly made, as its great proponent Careme
  would have insisted, from knuckle of veal or calf's foot, but ready-to-use powdered aspic is widely
  used."<br>
  ---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 38)
<p>
"The original meaning of aspic was 'a cold dish of meat, fish, eggs, etc. set in moulded jelly', and only gradually did the term
come to be used for the jelly itself. The earliest reference to aspic in English (by Dr. Johnson's friend Mrs. Piozzi in 1789) is in 
the plural, and Thackeray in Vanity Fair (1848) has general Tioptoff dying 'of an apsic of plovers' eggs'. English borrowed
the word from French, but its ultimate origins are wrapped in obscurity...It was the French chef Careme who began the
vogue for aspic at the turn of the nineteenth century, and bizarre creations of moulded, fluted, and chopped aspic
became a hall mark of the ponderous haute cuisine of the Victorian era."<br>

<a name="isinglass">
<b>What was isinglass?</b><br>
  "Isinglass consists of collagen, which, when heated with water, yields a pure form of gelatin.
Isinglass is obtained from the swimming bladder (also known as  sound') of certain fish,
especially the sturgeon (from which the  Russian 'isinglass' is obtained), but also a large catfis of
S. America (yielding  Brazilian isinglass'), some species of Asian waters, and (in N. American
waters) hake and cod. The sounds, once removed form the fish and cleaned, are dried, and treated
to acquire various shapes...A main use of isinglass has been for clarifying liquids, including
wines and beers. Its fibrous structure apparently gives it this capability, which is not possessed by
ordinary gelatin. Isinglass used to be equally important for culinary purposes, especially
confectionery and desserts such as fruit jelly and blancmange; but its cost by comparison with
competing products has virtually ended this practice."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford Univeristy Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 401)
<p>
<b>When was isinglass first employed?</b><br>
"In recipes of the mid-fifteenth century the liquor was based upon fresh pike, and if it would not jell, 'sounds' [swimming bladders]
of watered stockfish' were added, precurors of the later isinglass...The sounds of stockfish helped to set jelly in the fifteenth century; but a hundred years later were ousted by isinglass, 
devived from sturgeons' sounds and brought by Dutch traders from Russia to Britian."<br>

"ISINGLASS OR GELATINE JELLY.
(Substitutes for Calfs Feet.)<br>
1413. INGREDIENTS.3 oz. of isinglass or gelatine, 2 quarts of water.<bR>
Mode.Put the isinglass or gelatine into a saucepan with the above proportion of cold water; bring it quickly to boil, and let it boil very fast, until the liquor is 
reduced one-half. Carefully remove the scum as it rises, then strain it through a jelly-bag, and it will be ready for use. If not required very clear, it may be merely 
strained through a fine sieve, instead of being run through a bag. Rather more than 1/2 oz. of isinglass is about the proper quantity to use for a quart of strong 
calfs-feet stock, and rather more than 2 oz. for the same quantity of fruit juice. As isinglass varies so much in quality and strength, it is difficult to give the exact 
proportions. The larger the mould, the stiffer should be the jelly; and where there is no ice, more isinglass must be used than if the mixture were frozen. This forms a 
stock for all kinds of jellies, which may be flavoured in many ways.
Time.11/2 hour.<br>
Sufficient, with wine, syrup, fruit, &c., to fill two moderate-sized moulds.
Seasonable at any time.<br>
Note.The above, when boiled, should be perfectly clear, and may be mixed warm with wine, flavourings, fruits, &c., and then run through the bag.
ISINGLASS.The best isinglass is brought from Russia; some of an inferior kind is brought from North and South America and the East Indies: the several 
varieties may be had from the wholesale dealers in isinglass in London. In choosing isinglass for domestic use, select that which is whitest, has no unpleasant 
odour, and which dissolves most readily in water. The inferior kinds are used for fining beer, and similar purposes. Isinglass is much adulterated: to test its purity,
 take a few threads of the substance, drop some into boiling water, some into cold water, and some into vinegar. In the boiling water the isinglass will dissolve, 
in cold water it will become white and cloudy, and in vinegar it will swell and become jelly-like. If the isinglass is adulterated with gelatine (that is to say, the 
commoner sorts of gelatine,for isinglass is classed amongst gelatines, of all which varieties it is the very purest and best), in boiling water the gelatine will not 
so completely dissolve as the isinglass; in cold water it becomes clear and jelly-like; and in vinegar it will harden."

given rise to a number of confusing names--as purse, pipe and lump isinglass, leaf, honeycomb, staple and book insinglass. All

According to the food historians, baking soda [bicarbonate of soda] dates back to ancient
civilization. It was not until the mid-19th century, however,  that it was regularly used by English
and American cooks. The most comprehensive discussion of the history of this topic may be
found in <i>English Bread and Yeast Cookery</i>, Elizabeth David [Penguin:Middlesex England]
1977. Your librarian can help you find a copy.
<p>
"Bicarbonate of soda: NaHCO3, has been used in cookery for so long that, despite its chemical
label it has largely escaped the growing opposition to  chemical' additives. It is an alkali which
reacts with acid by effervescing--producing carbon dioxide. It is therefore a leavening agent in
baking, if used in conjunction with, say, tartaric acid...The alkaline properties of bicarbonate of
soda can also be used to soften the skins of beans and other pulses. And a pinch added to the
cooking water makes cabbage and other green vegetables greener, but its effect on the pigment
chlorophyl. However, it also induces limpness (by breaking down hemicelluloses) and the loss of
vitamins B1 and C; and in the practice, which dates back to classical Rome and used to be
recommended in Britain and N. America, has largely died out."<br>

<b>Pearlash</b><br>
"Pearl ash--This was a popular name for potassium carbonate, a refined form of potash, in turn an
alkaline substance obtained by leaching ashes of wood or other plants (pot ashes). The use of
wood ash in meat curing is ancient. And lye, the leaching water, has long been used from
cleansing and making of soap. But the use of these alkaline substances as leavening appears to be
American in origin. Study of Indian lore is frustrating because of early contamination, but it does
seem that Indians employed ash as seasoning becasue of its salt content, and as a foaming agent in
their breads. With corn meal, even using purer forms, the effect is largely a change in texture; with
wheat flour, the leavening is specatular and virtually instantaneous, particularly when sparked by
the acidity of sour milk, for example.
     This usage is first recorded, it seems, in 1796 by Amelia Simmons in a recipe for gingerbread;
molasses supplies the requisite acidity. But the practice clearly was widespread and already of
long standing as shown by a recipe for  Handy-cake or Bread in <i>Essays and Notes on
Husbandry and Rural Affairs</i> by J. B. Bordley (1801): "The good people of Long Island call
this pot-ash or handy-cake;...wheat flour 2 lbs; sugar 1/2 lb, have added to them a tea spoonful of
salt of tartar heaped, or any other form of pot or pearl ash."...Gradually, saleratus and other
 baking sodas replaced pearl ash...Eventually, acid and alkali were combined in one  baking
powder'."<br>

"The alkaline component of baking powder is usually Bicarbonate of Soda, also known as baking
soda.  The first type, invented in the USA in 1790 was  pearl ash', potassium carbonate prepared
from wood ash. This provided only the alkali; the acid had come from some other ingredients, for
example sour mlk. Pearl ash reacted with fats in the food, forming soap which gave an unpleasant
taste. Soon it was replaced by bicarbonate of soda, which still reacts in this was but to a much
smaller extent. An American name used for either of these alkali-only agents was saleratus.<p>
   True baking powder, containing both bicarbonate of soda and an acid, was introduced around
1850. The acid was cream of tartar or tartaric acid, both of which conveniently form crystals. This
was mixed with a little starch to take up moisture and so keep the other components dry, so that
they did not react prematurely. A disadvantage of this mixture was that is sprang into rapid action
as soon as it was wetted, so that the dough had to mixed quickly and put straight into the oven
before the reaction stopped.<p>
   Modern baking powder still uses these substances, but some of the cream of tartar (or tartaric
acid) is replaced with a slower acting substance such as acid sodium pyrophosphate. This hardly
reacts at all at room temperature, but speeds up when heated, so that bread and cakes rise well
in the oven."<br>

<b>What was saleratus?</b><br>
Good question. We find several definitions of this compound chemical leavener:
<p>
"Saleratus.<br> An early-nineteenth-century form of baking powder (1830). Used as a leavening
agent, it was an improvement over pearlash (used in the eighteenth century) and predated baking
soda, which came along in the 1870s. Saleratus (which in Latin means "aerated salt") was first
made from potassium bicarbonate, then sodium bicarbonate, and it imparted an undesirable
bitterness. One may still hear of old-fashioned saleratus bread and biscuits, although one will no
longer find saleratus in a grocery store."<br>
---<i>The Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink,</i> John Mariani  [Lebhar-Friedman:New
York] 1999 (p. 280)
<p>
"A score of years before the Civil War, the American breadmaker received help in the form of a
new leavening agent called saleratus, which changed its name later to baking soda. It was
convenient to use, but required the help of an acid to perform its work; cream of tartar was the
one usually chosen. In 1856, baking powder was devised; this provided the cream of tartar, or
some equivalent, already mixed with the baking soda."<br>

York] 1976 (p. 225)

<p>
"In order to make their bread and cakes rise the emigrants [westward-bound pioneers] carefully
packed saleratus. Saleratus, from the Latin salaeratus (aerated salt), is potassium or sodium
bicarbonate, a chalklike substance. It was a commercial leavening product that, like its
predecessor pearlash, allowed cooks to bake bread without yeast and cakes without large
quantities of beaten eggs. Saleratus had to be mixed with an acidic food or chemical, such as
cream of tartar, to activate the leavening process. Unlike our present-day baking soda, which
must adhere to a standard formula, the leavening action of saleratus depended on the brand.
Manufacturers in that era varied the amounts of chemicals added according to what they thought
was the best formula. As a rule, saleratus was stronger than today's baking soda. Saleratus was
first processed by adding carbonic acid to pearlash and changing potassium carbonate to
bicarbonate. Later the product was made from the reamins of marine plants and sea salt, a
fortunate discovery because pearlash was derived from the ashes of trees. Large forests had been
stripped to meet the demand for this new product. Saleratus became available commercially in
1840 and was packaged in paper envelopes with recipes. Catherine Beecher, considered an
authority on domestic matters, advised the "when Pearlash or Saleratus becomes damp, dissolve it 
in as much water as will just entirely dissolve it, and no more. A tablespoonful of this equals a
teaspoonful of solid. Keep it cored in a junk bottle." Saleratus worked best when added to dough
that would bake quickly over a high heat. Cast-iron utensils placed over the intense heat of an
outdoor fireplace served perfectly. Cooking over hot coals had many disadvantages but it did
produce heat quickly. If the supply of saleratus brought from home was depleted, the emigrants
supplemented it from natural soda springs found near Sweetwater River...Besides using saleratus
as a leavening agets in baked goods...[emigrants] used it to hull corn."<br>

Press of Kansas:Lawrence] 1993 (p. 9-11)
<p>
"Saleratus: the monopotamic or monosodic carbonate. The potassium salt was formerly used in
baking, but it has been generally displaced by bi-carbonate of sodium, which is preferable as a
culinary ingredient and more easily assimilated by the system."<br>

<b>Baking powder</b><br>
"Baking powder:     A combination of sodium bicarbonate and acid salt salt that became popular
in the 1850s as a
leavening agent in baking what came to be called  quick bread,  lightnin' bread, or  aerated
bread. By 1854 Americans had self-rising flour, which was baking powder mixed with flour. In
1867 James A. Church introduced Arm & Hammer "baking soda," a new term for the earlier used
but less desirable potassium or sodium bicarbonate, also called  saleratus" (an American variant of
the Latin sal [salt] "+aeratus" [aerated]).    In 1889 William M. Wright developed a double-acting
baking powder whose leavening
action began in the dough and repeated in the oven. Wright and his partner, chemist George C.
Rew, marketed the product under the name Calumet Baking Powder."<br>

Food historians are still contemplating the origins of blackeyed peas (aka cowpeas). Among the probably centers of
origin are Africa (most cited) and Asia (due to the taxonomy of classification).  
<p>
"Cowpea...also called "long bean," "asparagus bean," and "yard long bean" because of the length of the pods, the cowpea
(Vigna unguiculata or V. sesquipedalis or V. sinensis) is, in fact, a bean. It has been cultivated since prehistoric times in
tropical Asia (especially in India) and is a relative of the mung bean and other Asian legumes, suggesting a South Asian
origin for the plant. However, China has been proposed as another center of origin, and because the plant occurs in the wild
in many parts of Africa, that contintent may have been yet another cradle of the cowpea. It reached the New World via the
slave trade and is today cultivated throughout the tropical and subtropical world. The cowpea comes in a number of varieties.
Black-eyed peas are perhaps the best known of these in the United States...Crowder peas and field peas are other favoriets,
especially in the South. Prior to the Civil war, cowpeas were sometimes given to slaves but they were used mostly for
animal fodder."<br>

<a name="broccoli">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Broccoli</b></font><br>

Broccoli has a long, interesting and oftimes confusing  history.  This vegetable is a member of
the Brassica family and is related to cabbage and cauliflower, which were often used in ancient
recipes. Food historians generally date brassicia back to about 6000BC. According to the <i>Oxford
English Dictionary</i>, the first recorded references to broccoli in English appear in Evelyn's
<i>Aceteria</i>, 1699.
<p>
"Broccoli...A member of the mustard family, and doubtless a descendant of the wild
cabbate...broccoli...began as a wild-growing native of the Mediterranean region. Like all
cabbages, broccoli was originally eaten for its stems, with the flowering heads a later
development. Although broccoli is believed to be the forerunner of cauliflower-a vegetable known
in Europe by the sixteenth century-it trailed behind cauliflower by about a century in culinary
usage, save perhaps in Italy. The Italians claim broccoli as their own: The name comes from the
Italian brocco, meaning  sprout' or  shoot' which , in turn came from the Latin brachium,
meaning  'arm' or  'branch'-a succinct description of this plant with its many thick and fleshy
stalks. Broccoli was introduced into England (where the term   'broccoli' refers to cauliflower)
around 1720 and was probably brought to North America soon thereafter..."<br>

<b>Italian asparagus?</b><br>
The theory about broccoli being a cross between asparagus and cauliflower is folklore. Three
hundred years ago the English called broccoli "Italian asparagus" which probably accounts for
some of the confusion.
<p>
"Some years ago an observant gentleman came into my office to discuss the origin of sprouting
broccoli. He insisted firmly that it must be the result of a cross between cabbage and asparagus,
because it had the flavor of cabbage and the fleshy stem of asparagus!Apparently this gentleman
had never seen cabbage plants push up their flower stalks, else he would have realized that the
developing flower stalk of cabbage and of sprouting broccoli are botanically the same thing.
Neither did he realize that cabbage and asparagus are much too distantly related to hybridize."<br>

<p>
"The first clear description of broccoli occurs in the 1724 edition of Miller's <i>Gardener's
Dictionary</i>, where it was described as a stranger in England  until within these five years' and was
called  'sprout  colli-flower' or  'Italian asparagus.' It seems to be generally accepted that the
broccoli thus introduced to England, and no doubt to other European countries at about the same
time, came from Italy. Broccoli is an Italian word meaning  'little arms' or  'little shoots'."<br>

<b>American re-introduction??</b><br>
Cook books and newspapers confirm broccoli took a hiatus from mainstream American tables from the late 19th century to the 1920s. 
Oscar Tschirky (Waldorf) offers recipes for cauliflower and Brussels sprouts. No mention of broccoli. Charles Ranhofer (Delmonico's)
followed suit. Why? We can only suppose these were culinary signs of the times. Possibly? Americans were feeling uneasy about the
surging influx of southern European immigrants. The 1920s was a time of culinary experimentation. The 1930s accepted make-do
ingredients. Broccoli came back, only now? It was decidedly an Italian food. No mention of Anglo/Colonial American
heritage. Interesting, yes?

"Boiled Broccoli (serves 4)</b><br>
2 pounds of broccoli<br>
Water<br>
Salt and pepper<br>
4 to 6 tablespoons of butter<br>
Cut off the lower tough portion of the brocoli stalks and them peel the remaining stalks up an inch or so. Trim off any wildted leaves. If the bunches
are not of uniform size, split the larger ones lengthwise so that all stalks will be the same thickness. Soak in cold water and a teaspoon of salt for 15
to 20 minutes to coax out any tiny insects. In a kettle, put enough water to cover the broccoli and bring it to a boil. Add the vegetagble and cook
gently, uncovered. After 5 minutes add a teaspoon of salt and continue cooking until the stalks are tender when pierced with a 
fork. Total cooking time should be about 10 to 15 minutes. Be careful not to overcook. The tender buds will turn mushy, the 
broccoli will lose its color and the flavor will be too strong. As with asparagus, the buds cook more quickly than the
stalks. If you wish to be sure that they will not be overdone, prop the broccoli up in the kettle with the heads out of the water (or tie
the stalks in bunches as you do asparagus) and over the pan. Cook gently until just tender--about 10 to 15 minutes. Drain the 
broccoli, season to taste with salt and pepper and serve with melted butter. You may also serve the brocoli with lemon butter
(add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice to each 4 tabelspoons of melted butter), Hollandaise Sauce, Buttered Bread Crumbs or sprinkled with
grated Parmesan cheese and then glazed under the broiler flame."<br>

21st century American diners are ingtrigued by little vegetables: baby carrots, fingerling potatoes, grape tomatoes, broccolini. While 
diminutive forms of familiar vegetables are nothing new (think: 1950s-style creamed pearl onions & oriental canned mini 
corncobs) these mini-me veggies steal the show when it comes to contemporary fine dining presentation. Some folks
link the small vegetable phenomenon to America's love for preparing convenient foods. Small veggies, conveniently
packaged, do not require cutting, making them the obvious choice for busy cooks. This makes perfect sense except for one 
thing: Mini veggies packaged this way cost significantly more than their traditional (gotta cut, scape, peel) counterparts.
On the other hand: prepared correctly, they look fabulous and taste amazing. Case in point? Broccolini.
<p>
"A new sprout in the enchanted broccoli forest is causing semantic chaos in specialty produce markets and leaving adventuresome retailers and 
cooks searching for words. The diminutive hybrid--mild, peppery and slightly sweet--is basically a baby broccoli. The pale stems are as slim as 
spears and rarely exceed six inches long; the head is a loose cluster of florets that resemble infant broccoli rape. Its flaor marries well with butter or
 olive oil, lemon, lime, light-tasting vinegars, pancetta, prosciutto, tarragon, Parmesean or fresh goat cheese. And because of its understated flavor, 
it is a logical candidate to serve with shellfish and mild-tasting meats like chicken or veal. But what to call it? Marketers have tried everything from 
brocoletti and broccolini to asphroboc and asprospeer...The Satka Seed Corporation, the Japanese company that developed the hybrid in 1993, 
called it aspiration, invoking the company's hopes while suggesting a relation to asparagus. But in 1995, when Sakata went into partnership with the 
Mann Packing Company, a large broccoli producer in Salinas, Calif., the vegetable's lineage was revealed as slightly more humble. Aspiration, it
 turns out, is a cross between broccoli and gai lan, or Chinese broccoli. Asparagus is not part of the equation...The name broccolini emphasizes its 
relationship to broccoli...The affectionate diminutive also appeals to the country's ongoing infatuation with baby vegetables...The little green is so
 new to the market and goes by so many aliases that it can be difficult to find. But the seeds have already passed from specialty boutique growers to 
major broccoli producers. Mann Packing...currently has 1,000 acres of broccolini under cultivation and expects to be growing 10,000 acres within two
 years."<br>

Brownies are the perfect teaching tool when it comes to recipe morph because we all
"know" what this item is. Or do we?
Food historians tell us "Brownie" recipes first surfaced in the late 19th century. They are correct. But? This item was a far cry
from what we know today. For starters, they had no chocolate. The first  <a href="foodfaq.html#1896brownie">
Brownie recipe</a>, circa 1896, produced what we now call a <a href="foodfaq.html#blondies">Blondie</a>. Go figure. Further complicating
matters? Professional confectioners advertised "Brownies" and/or "Chocolate Brownies" in their candy catalogs. We do not have a
description of this item. We do know, however, it was not fudge because that item is also advertised. <a href="foodfaq.html#creamcheesebrownies">Cream
Cheese Brownies</a> surface in the 1960s.
<p>
<b>Why call them Brownies?</b><br>
Excellent question with more than one possible answer:<br>
1. "Some say brownies were invented by a <a href="foodfaq.html#schrumpf">woman named Brownie</a>." <br>
---<i>The American Century Cookbook</i>, Jean Anderson [Clarkson Potter:New York] 1997

2. John Mariani theorizes the name was possibly borrowed from Palmer Cox's popular "Brownies" cartoon elves, circa 1887<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 44)<br>
3. The name is an Americanized form of <a href="foodfaq.html#broonie">broonie</a>, a Scottish confection.

<b>Chocolate Brownies</b><br>
Food historians generally agree the first published recipe for Chocolate Brownies, as we know them today, appeared in the
<a href="foodfaq.html#1906brownies">1906</a> edition of Fannie Merritt Farmer's <i>Boston Cooking School Cook Book</i>.
 This coincides with the mass production and active promotion of chocolate products by USA food companies.
Thanks to one of our readers, we submit for your examinination a possible progenitor, <a href="foodfaq.html#1899brownies">circa 1899</a>.
<p>
"The first chocolate brownie recipe was...published by Fannie Farmer in her
1906 revision of the <i>Boston Cooking-School Cook Book</i>. The proportions are similar to
her 1896 chocolate cookie recipe, except that she radically reduced the amount of the flour. In the
chocolate recipe she specified a "7-inch square pan."...[Maria Willett] Howard, who had been
trained by Fannie Farmer, was then employed by the Walter Lowney chocolate company. She
enriched Farmer's chocolate brownie recipe with an extra egg, creating Lowney's Brownies. She
then varied the recipe by adding an extra square of chocolate and named the Bangor Brownies.
This last recipe apparently started the idea that brownies were invented by housewives in
Bangor, Maine. The leading advocate of the Bangor theory of brownie origin was <a href="foodfaq.html#schrumpf">Mildred Brown
Schrumpf</a>, aptly nicknamed "Brownie," born in Bangor in 1903. Unfortunately, Mrs. Schrumpf's
best piece of evidence was a <i>Girl's Welfare Cook Book</i> published there in 1912. This is
not only seven years post-Farmer, but the recipe contributed by Marion Oliver for Chocolate
Brownies to that cookbook is almost exactly the same as the two-egg recipe for Lowney's
Brownies, not Bangor Brownies. Oliver also contributed a recipe for Molasses Brownies
evidently taken from the Farmer cookbook...Maria Howard may have considered the Bangor
Brownies, which were to be baked in a cake pan (unlike her Lowney's Brownies), to be
descended from a recipe for Bangor Cake in Maria Parloa's <i>Appledore Cook Book</i>
(1872), which was a white sheet cake...In fact, the two-egg Lowney's Brownies was the recipe
most often reprinted in New England community cookbooks before 1912."<br>
---<i>The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America</i>, Andrew F. Smith editor
[Oxford University Press:New York] 2004, Volume 1 (p. 136-7)
<p>
"The two earliest recipes I could find for chocolate brownies appear in the 1906 edition of <i>The
Boston Cooking-School Cook Book</i> (with 2 squares Baker's Chocolate, melted) and in
<i>Lowney's Cook Book</i>, written by Maria Willet Howard and published by the Walter M.
Lowney Company of Boston in 1907...A note in <i>Betty Crocker's Baking Classics</i> (1979)
says that Bangor Brownies are probably the original chocolate brownies. Legend has it that a
Bangor, Maine, housewife was baking chocolate cake one day and it fell. Instead of pitching it
out, this frugal cook cut the collapsed cake into bars and served it, apparently with high marks.
Was that the beginning of brownies as we know them today? New York food historian Meryle
Evans doubts it, believing this story, like so many others, to be apocryphal. 
...brownies are an Americanization of
Scottish cocoa scones...The real story isn't known...Whatever their true origin, brownies didn't
become popular until the 1920's."<br>

The earliest print reference we find for combining <a href="foodcakes.html#creamcheese">cream cheese</a> with

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Brussels sprouts</b></font><br>


The general consensus of the food historians is that Brussels sprouts were
first propagated in northern Europe sometime between the 17th and 18th
century. Ancient/Classical Mediterranean claims are unclear and not
documented to the satisfaction of scholars. Presumably they are based on
the fact that cabbages, from which Brussels sprouts originated, were
grown in this place/period. Notes here:
<p>
"Brusssels sprouts...Members of the cabbage family that descended from the
cabbage (Brassica oleracea) and were named for the capital of Belgium,
Brussels sprouts are immature buds shaped line tiny cabbages...Although
the cabbage is native to the Mediterranean region (where it has been
cultivated for some 2,500 years), Brussels sprouts were developed in
northern Europe (the cabbage was carroed there by the Romans) around the
fifth century--or prehaps even later. One source claims that the plant was
cultivated near Brussels in the thirteenth century; another places the
first recorded description of Brussels sprouts in 1587; still another
claims that they have been widely grown in Europe only since the
seventeeth century; wheras at least one more source insists that they have
become popular in Europe only since World War I. Of course, these claims
are not necessarily contradictory. Brussels sprouts reached North America
with French settlers, who grew them in Louisiana, but they have been
popular in the United States only during the twentieth century."<br>
---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kenneth F. Kiple & Kriemhild Conee
Ornelas [Cambridge Universtiy Press:Cambridge] 2001, Volume Two (p.
1738-9)
<p>
"Brussels Sprouts, Brassica oleracea, Gemmifera group, a many-headed
subspecies of the common cabbage. The main head never achieves more than a
straggly growth while many miniature head buds grow around the stem...Some
authors have referred to the possibility that they were known in classical
times, and cite stray references from Brussels in the 13th century and
documents about wedding feasts of the Burgundian court at Lille in the
15th century. However, sprouts only became known in French and English
gardens at the end of the 18th century and a little later in N. America,
where Thomas Jefferson planted some in 1812."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University
Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 110)
<p>
"The cabbage is the oldest of the edible varieties of vegetables which
provided inspiration for the gatherers in their plant-hunting and their
culinary creativity...The magic of cultivation has now created some 400
varieties...Brussels sprouts gown ever since the seventeenth century for
the little buds sprouting from the stem..."<br>
---<i>History of Food</i>, Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat, translated by Anthea Bell
[Barnes & Noble Books:New York] 1992 (p. 690-1)
<p>
"Firmly ensconced as they now are, brussels sprouts...seem to be a
comparatively recent addition to the British table. The first recorded
reference to them comes in Charles Marshall's Plain and Easy Introduction
to Gardening (1796), and their description ('Brussels sprouts are winter
greens growing much like borrcole [kale]') suggests that they may first
have been valued for the tuft of leaves at the top of their tall thick
stem rather than the small green buttons growing up it...The first cookery
writer to mention them seems to have been Eliza Acton, who in her Modern
Cookery (1845) gives directions for cooking and serving them in 'the
Belgian mode', boiled and with melted butter poured over them. But why
brussels sprouts? They seem always to have been popular in Flanders and
northern France, and market regulations for the Brussels area as long ago
as 1213 mention them, but when the name was actually conferred on them is
not clear."<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxfod]
2002 (p. 44-5)
<p>
According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, the earliest print reference to Brussels Sprouts appears in 1796. The fact that
these compact cabbages were known prior to this time means they were likely called something else. While Eliza Acton gets the credit
for publishing the first English language recipe, we wonder if Hannah Glasse beat her to the punch.
<blockquote>
<b>[1747]<br>
"To dress Cabbages, &s.</b><br>
Cabbage, and all Sorts of young Sprouts must be boiled in a great deal of Water. When the Stalks are tender, or fall to the
Bottom, they are enough; then take them off, before they lose their Colour. Always throw Salt into your Water before you put your 
Greens in. Young Sprouts you send to Table just as they are, but Cabbage is best chop'd and put into a Sauce-pan with a good Piece
of Butter, stirring it for about five or six Minutes till the Butter is all melted, and then sent it to Table."<br>

<p>
<b>[1845]<br>
"Brussels Sprouts.</b><br>
These delicate little sprouts, or miniature cabbages, which at their fullest growth scarcely exceed a
large walnut in size, should be quite freshly gathered. Free them from all discoloured leaves, cut
the stems even, and wash the sprouts thorougly. Throw them into a pan of water properly salted,
and boil them quickly from eight to ten minutes; drain them well, and serve them upon a rather
thick round of toasted bread buttered on both sides. Send good melted butter to table with them.
This is the Belgian mode of dressing this excellent vegetables, which is served in France with the
sauce poured over it, or it is tossed in a stewpan with a spice of butter and some pepper and salt;

Old world, sustainable, on the list of plain grains commonly noted for keeping humans from starving through time. No glamor,
kingly glitz or classic poetry. Of course? Feeding humanity is an art unto itself. Buckwheat does just that. 
<p>
"Buckwheat is believed to be native to Manchuria and Siberia and, reportedly, was 
cultivated in China by at least 1000 B.C. However, fragments of the grain have been 
recovered from Japanese sites dating from between 3500 and 5000 B.C., suggesting a 
much earlier date for the grain's cultivation. It was an important crop in Japan and 
reached Europe through Turkey and Russia during the fourteenth and fifteenth 
centuries A.D., although legend would have it entering Europe much earlier with the 
returning Crusaders. Buckwheat was introduced into North America in the seventeenth 
century by the Dutch, and it is said that is name derives from the Dutch word bockweit 
(meaning "beech wheat"), because the plant's triangular fruits resemble beechnuts...It 
is a hardy plant that grew in Europe where other plants did not and, thus, supplied 
peasants in such areas with porridge and pancakes. Production of buckwheat peaked 
in the early nineteenth century and has declined since then." <br>
---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kenneth F. Kiple & Kriemhild Conee Ornelas [Cambridge 
University Press:Cambridge] 2000] Volume One (p. 90) 
<p>
"Buckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum, a plant of the same family as rhubarb, sorrel, and 
dock...There are several species of buckwheat, all native to temperate E. Asia. The 
wild ancestor of the cultivated type is thought to be perennial buckwheat, Fagoprym 
dibotrys, which grows in the Himalayas and China...Although buckwheat has certainly 
been gathered from the wild for a long time in its native region, deliberate cultivation 
may not be very ancient. The first written records of the plant are in Chinese 
documents of the 5th and 6th centuries A.D. It appears to have reached Japan from 
Korea in antiquity and an official chronicle (Shoku-Nihongi), complete in 722, contains 
the earliest known mention of buckwheat in Japan. Buckwheat reached E. Europe from 
Russia in the Middle Ages, entering Germany in the 15th century. Later it came to 
France and Italy where it was known as Saracen corn', a name which survives in both 
languages; and Spain, where a name derives from Arabic was used. For several 
centuries it was grown as a crop of minor importance in most of Europe, including 
Britain...Buckwheat was grown by early European settlers in N. America, and figures in 
traditional dishes there...The most renowned of all buckwheat dishes is kasha, a 
specialty of Russia nd E. Europe...Buckwheat noodles have been made in China and 
Russia, but are a particular specialty of Japan." <br>

<p>
"Buckwheat...was propagated in the New World for fodder and cereal, as is known 
through a reference by Adam Smith in 1776. "Buckwheat cakes," pancakes made with 
buckwheat four and dating in print to 1772, were popular everywhere in the country in 
the nineteenth century." <br>

<a name="capers">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>capers</b></font><br>

Capers are the pickled olive green flower bud of the Mediterranean shrub Capparis spinosa.
 They native to the Mediterranean region and have been enjoyed by people since ancient
 times. They are referenced in the Bible and were common condiments for the Ancient
 Greeks and Romans. Capers are *pickled* which means seasoned in vinegar.
 <p>
 "Among other classic condiments were capers, used by the ancient Greeks and included
 by
 Athenaeum as *chaperon* in his list of seasonings. The caper bush, *Caperes spinosa*
 is a prickly shrub which grows naturally around the Mediterranean basin and in the
 Middle East, and was a wild plant for a long time. Capers are its flower and buds
 pickled in seasoned vinegar. The English word *capers* is from French *capres* found
 as *caspres* in the fifteenth-century Chartres Bible. In the Renaissance the surgeon
 Ambroise Pare found the condiment so agreeable that he wrote: "Capers are good, in
 that they sharpen the appetite and relieve the bile."<br>
 ---<i>History of Food</i>, Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat [Barnes & Noble Books:New York]
 1992 (p.529)
 <p>
 "...The plant, which is sprawling and has tenacious spines (hence one Turkish
 vernacular name meaning *cat's claw*), bears small fruits which may also be picked.
 Fresh capers are not used. The characteristic and slightly bitter flavour which is the
 virtue of capers, and which is mainly due to the formation of capric acid, is only
 developed by pickling. The buds are picked before they start to open, and pickled in
 vinegar. The most prized ones are called *non pareilles* in France, followed in
 increasing order of size and diminishing value by *surfines*, *capuchines*, *fines* and
 *capotes*. Because buds develop fast, plants have to be picked over more or less daily,
 a procedure which affects their cost."<br>
 ---<i>The Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford]
 1999 (p. 132)
 <p>
 "Capers have been used since at least the time of the ancient Greeks as a condiment to
 add a salty-sour flavor to sauces, cheeses, salad dressings, stews, and various other meat
 and fish dishes. The caper bush grows wild and thrives in southern Europe, where Italy
 and Spain are the biggest caper producers."<br>
 ---<i>The Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kenneth F. Kiple & Kriemhild Ornelas
 [Cambridge University Press: Cambridge] 2000 (p. 1744)
 <p>
 "Pickled barberries were much in favour in the Tudor and Stuart era, as were capers,
 preserved in vinegar and imported by the barrelful from southern Europe. A homemade
 substitute was pickled broom buds, and many recipes existed for their preparation."<br>

<b>What is a cashew?</b><br>
"Cashew. A kidney-shaped nut that grows in a double shell at the end of a strongly sweet-smelling, pear-shaped fruit, the cashew (Anacardium occidentale) is a very unusual nut. The
largest part of the fruit is the juicy, pear-shaped fruit called the cashew "apple," which is
eaten raw or fermented to become alcohol. The nut itself grows at the lower end of the
"apple," but one never sees cashews sold in the shell for a very good reason. The cashew is
related to poison ivy and poison sumac, and the shells contain an irritating oil that must be
gotten rid of by heating before the nut can be extracted. The tree is a native of South
America, but in the sixteenth century the Portuguese introduced it in the East African and
Indian parts of their empire, and these areas are today the biggest exporters of cashews."<br>
---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kenneth F. Kiple and Kriemhild Connee Ornelas
[Cambridge University Press:Cambridge] 2000, Volume Two (p. 1747)
<p>
<b>Why do we call it "cashew?"</b><br>
"The native region of the cashew is thought to be NE Brazil. As long ago as the 16th century
it was taken from there by the Portuguese to the E. Indies, whence cultivation spread to
India. The Portuguese turned the Brazilian Tupi name acaju into caju, the names in most
languages come from this."<br>

"The cashew is the seed of a tropical tree, Anacardium occidentale, which originated in
Central and South America (hence the name, which comes from caju or acaju in the
language of the Tupi people of the Amazon basin), but is now grown extensively in Africa
and India. The seed itself...was first described in English by William Dampier in <i>A New
Voyage Round the World</i> (1703): 'The Cashew is a Fruit as big as a Pippin, pretty long, and
bigger near the Stem than at the other end...The Seed of this Fruit grows at the end of it; 'tis
of an Olive Colour shaped like a Bean.'"<br>

"Cashew. A native to southeast Brazil, the cashew must have been a early transer, since even in AD 1578 Acosta describes the
'caiu...found in the gardens at the city of Santa Cruz in the kingdom of Cochin'. The so-called cashew 'fruit' is really the
swollen stalk or penduncle, from which Jesuit priests in Goa developed the strong distilled drink feni, with a distinctive flavour. The
kidney shaped nut hangs below this 'fruit'as is aptly denoted by the Tamil word mundiri for it. In Kerala the nut is called parangi-mav
or -andi (meaning foreign stone), and the fruit is called gomanga, perhaps because it came to Kerala from Goa. The name caju, which the 
Portuguese brought to India and which is still used in Indian languages, derives form the term acaju of the Tepi tribe of
Brazil, which was later anglicized to cashew."<br>
---<i>A Historical Dictionary of Indian Food</i>, K.T. Achaya [Oxford University Press:Delhi] 1998 (p. 38)
<p>
"As significant as any of the introductions of Latin American fruits was that of the cashew nut. In the latter half of the sixteenth
century the Portuguese took the cashew tree to Goa, and on the west coast it was first used primarily to check erosion. The tree
thrived there and today India is a world leader in cashew production, with exports outstripping even Brazil, the cashew's original
home. The local name, kaju, is a Portuguese corruption of the Brazilian name acajau, and the antecedent of our 'cashew'. 
...The fruit is highly astringent, but in Goa was soon being put to good use in distilling a spirit called feni...The nut
became widely used in sweetmaking by professional Indian confectioners. It as cheaper than the traditional almond, for which it was 
often substituted. And in Dainty Cooking for the Home, Margaret Denning suggests cashew nuts as a substitute for

"Cashew-Nut....Kajoo.--This tree grows wild, to a large size, in many parts fo the Deccan, and is found in Native gardens as
well as European. It is very ornamental wen in leaf, bearing sweet-smelling flowers, succeeded by a pear-shaped fruit f a jellow and red
colour, which is eaten by the poorer class. The nut hangs at the end of the fruit outside, and is of kidney shape. Between a double
shell, covering the kernel, is a very acrid juice, which, if applied to the skin, or inadvertantly to the lips, immediately raises
a blister. The juice is sometimes used for making linen, as it is impossible to wash it out. The milky juice from the tree will
also stain linen a dark brown colour. The kernel when roasted is very sweet and pleasant, but is considered rather astringent. In the 
West Indies the fruit or apple is bruised, and a juice expressed from it and fermented, whcih produces a sort of wine; and if distilled, a
spirit is drawn from it, which makes excellent punch. The gum that exudes from this tree is valuable, from its resemblance to

are the shape of reversed pears, with highly-polished skins, the "nut" being bourne at the
broad tip. Long before the fruit itself appears, the nuts may be seen, the fruit forming back of
the seeds. The fruits vary greatly in quality, some being quite sweet while others are too
"puckery" or astringent to be edible. They are very juicy and even the rather puckery
varieties have a most remarkable thirst-quenching and refreshing effect. They make excellent
conserves, jellies, and pies. When raw the shells of the nuts contain a highly corrosive,

This edible New World root vegetable has the dubious distinction of being poisonous in its raw state. It must be carefully prepared to 
eliminate the natural poisons. Easily grown and carboydrate rich, cassava has played a key role in the traditional cuisines of
Central and South America for thousands of years. Europeans introduced this root on a <a href="foodfaq.html#europecassava">global</a> level. 
Onced processed, cassava offers a fascinating array of <a href="foodfaq.html#casssavacookery">culinary applications</a>.

<p>
<b>What is cassava?</b><br>
"The name 'manioc'...comes from the Brazilian Indian word mandioca, but the plant is also cinow as cassava, yuca, and the 
tapioca-plant. A Brazilian native, it is a perennial shrub with long, narrow, starchy tubers. Manioc traveled in canoes with South 
American Indians migrating northward into the Caribbean and, later, in Portuguese ships from Brazil to Africa. Its advantages are 
that it requires little labor to cultivate yet produces more calories per acre than any other food plant, and it keeps in the ground 
until needed. A disadvantage is that save for carbohydrates, it has little to offer in the way of nutrients. Another is that although 
sweet manioc varieties pose no threat, the roots of most varieties are bitter and can contain enough cyanide to be toxic. The poison 
must first be removed by pounding, scraping, and cooking. The vegetable is then boiled or baked like a potato, made into a 
flour for breads, and employed to thicken soup. The meal or flour is sprinkled onto most any dish. Tapioca is a kind of manioc flour." <br>

<b>Origin</b><br>
"Although scholars agree that manioc was domesticated in the Americas, there is doubt about the exact location, even though the largest variety of species survive in 
Brazil. Possible areas of origin include Central America, the Amazon region, and the northeast of Brazil. Milton de Albuquerque, a specialist on manioc in Amazonia, reported that the most 
primitive form of the plant is found in central Brazil in the state of Goias,...but he believes that the backlands of the state of Bahia are its most probably point of origin. The oldest 
archaeological records in Brazil..come from the Amazon region, where ceramic griddles used in manioc preparation have been found in pre-Columbian sites. Of much grater 
antiquity, however, are remains of the manioc plant that have been discovered in South American excavations in an near the Casma Valley of northern Peru. These have been 
dated to 1785 B.C....In Mexico, cassava leaves that are 2.500 years old have been found, along with cassava starch in human coprolites that are 2,100 to 2,800 years old...Preclassic 
Pacific coast archaeological sites in Mesoamerica have yielded evidence of manioc, which was a staple of the Mayan civilization...The quality of the evidence for manioc in 
Mesoamerica has led some authors to believe that manioc was first domesticated in Central America rather than Brazil...Another possibility might be that bitter manioc was 
domesticated in northern South America, whereas sweet cassava was domesticated in Central America. Archaeological evidence for ancient manioc usage also exists 
in the Caribbean...manioc griddles have been found in archaeological excavations in the Lesser Antilles...Both the Arawaks and Caribs utilized them, and as they migrated to the islands form 
South America, they undoubtedly carried with them manioc and the technological knowledge necessary to propagate, cultivate, and process it." <br>

"It used to be thought that there were two species of manioc, the bitter or poisonous one, Manihot 
utilissima, which contains enough hydrocyanic acid to make it deadly if consumed without processing, and the innocuous sweet species, Manihot dulcis. Because 
these two intergrated, they have now been combined to form one variable species knows as Manihot esculenta...It is mostly used in humid lowland tropics, 
which means that the archaelogical record is sparse, but it may have been domesticated in northeastern Brazil, where there are still many wild species. There is a 
secondary cluster of wild species in Mexico, and some think the sweet variety was domesticated there and the bitter one in Brazil. Since it is so far unfortunately 
impossible to distinguish sweet from bitter manioc in vegetable matter found archaeologically, one must rely on finding artifacts such as the stone chips for graters, 
which are associated with the processing of bitter manioc, to know which of the two was being cultivated. Using this sort of evidence we can say that bitter manioc 
was apparently being grown in the lowlands of Venezuela and Colombia by about 3000 B.C., and sweet manioc was probably being planted on the coast of Peru 
by about 2000 B.C." <br>

<b>European "discovery" & diffusion</b><br>

stations in the Upper Guinea coast in West Africa and to the Kingdom of Kongo in northern Angola (p.183)...Europeans also transported the American crop to Asia, although 
Polynesians may have also introduced it into the Pacific via Easter Island. The first Asian region to receive manioc from the Europeans was the Philippines...It is likely that

<b>How is cassava prepared & what kinds of food are made?</b><br>
"As a food, manioc is very verstatile because it can be boiled in a mush, roasted, baked, and even consumed as a pudding (tapioca) or 
alcoholic beverage...William Jones has observed that modern methods for processing manioc roots derive from Indian 
methods. In order to consume the bitter varieties, they had to detoxify the plant by grating and 
soaking it to remove the toxic chemicals...To prepare the coarse meal, known as farinha de 
mandioca (also farinha de pau) in Brazil, women, who traditionally process manioc in Amerindian 
societies, have to wash, peel, and scrape the roots. Some prehistoric populations on South 
America and the Caribbean even used their upper front teeth in processing manioc. Using a flat 
piece of wood studded with small pointed stones as a grater, women convert the roots into a 
snowy white mass, which is then placed in a tipiti, a long cylindrical basket press similar to a 
Chinese "finger trap." The two ends of the tipiti are pulled apart, with one end tied to the ground 
and the other to the branch of a tree. After the excess liquid has been squeezed out, the 
pulpy mass is removed, put though a sieve, and then placed on a flat ceramic griddle or metal 
basin where it is toasted over a low fire. The farinha can be kept for months and then eaten dry or 
mixed with water as a gruel."<br>

"How, we wonder, did an India happen to suspect that a member of this group of plants possessed edible roots? But even more remarkable and more puzzling is how the 
aborigines ever discovered that the roots were edible, for in their natural state they are very poisonous, often deadly, owning to the hydrocyanic or prussic acid they 
contain. While there are two well recognized types of the plant known as the 'sweet' and the 'bitter', both are poisonous in their raw state, although the sweet varieties contain far 
less of the poison......we can only marvel how the primitive Indians ever discovered how to eliminate the deadly acid and transform the roots into a wholesome nutritious food. Surely it could not have been 
by experimenting, for the experimenters would have died long before they had discovered they had discovered the secret. Very probably the discover was made by chance or by 
accident just as so many other great discoveries have been made by both primitive and civilized men. But it must have been made countless centuries ago for the 
secret to have spread throughout the length and breadth of Tropical America until it was known to every tribe...In preparing the bitter or more poisonous varieties of manioc or yuca, 
the Indian women first carefully wash and pare the roots, thus eliminating a large part of the poison...The next step in the process is to grate the roots...Some tribes chop or 
pound the roots, others grind them between rough stones...When a sufficient number of the roots have been grated, the damp soggy white mass is packed into a device 
known as the metapee. This consists of a basket work cylinder so woven that its diameter increases or diminishes when the ends are pressed together or drawn apart... 
thus producing a coarse granular meal, which is cooked or baked on hot stones or on a sheet of iron placed over a slow fire. Sometimes the meal is kept stirred while being baked, thus 
producing a dry crisp meal known as farine while at other times the sifter root is slightly moistened and is baked in the form of huge thin disks or cakes known as cassava 
bread. But in either case the baking serves to drive off the last remaining traces of the poison...cassava cakes...if kept dry will keep almost indefinitely. This starch, prepared manioc meal is the source of the well known tapioca 
of commerce, so widely used on our own tables...Excellent starch is another product of the manioc or cassava root, while finally there is the paiwari, and alcoholic intoxicating drink made by the 
Indians form the scorched farine or cakes...Like the peacepipe of the North American tribes the calabash of paiwari is the symbol of friendship...Unlike the bitter manioc...the sweet manioc or 
yuca as it is more generally called, is eaten mainly as a vegetable. Sometimes it is made into a soup, at other times it is boiled and eaten the carrots or other root vegetables... 
A paste made of the raw roots is also widely used in the West Indies, as well as by the South American Indians, as a healing ointment." <br>

"Sweet manioc, which was always a crop of secondary importance, was mainy grown as an adjunct to maize. it was easy to prepare: All you needed to to was take 
a fresh root, harvested that same day, and put it either in the embers of the fire or on a rack of green sticks, a barbacoa, over them. You turned the root from time 
to time, and when it emitted a strong and agreeable odor, you removed it, peeled it, and ate it. It was far harder to convert the bitter manioc into something edible. 
The root had to be grated, either on a grater painstakingly constructed out of stone chips or perhaps on a sharkskin....The dry matter left in the tube was almost 
pure starch. it could be baked into great cakes on a flat clay griddle over the fire, the thickness of the cakes ranging from collision mats two fingers thick, made of 
coarsely grated manioc for the commoners, to exquisite thin white cakes made of super finely grated manioc for the top people. The Europeans quickly 
discovered the virtues of this bread. The plants were easy to grow, it was cheap and simple to prepare in large quantites, and, best of all, it would keep, dry, for 
several years, making it ideal for military andnaval rations...once dry manioc bread was dipped into chile sauce, broth, or water, it again became soft and palatable... 
It was berated as being as tasteless as sawdust by the Europeans, but it played amajor role in the conquest of the New World by the military and the religious. Juan 
de Santa Gertrudis Serra, an eighteenth-century Francisan missionary, gives us a description of his first encounter with manioc bread in Cartagena, Colombia, 
where it was called cazaage, a word related to cassava, the British colonial term for manioc...Father Serra may have had a low opinion of it, but manioc continues 
to be a major source of calories." <br>

The word casserole has two meanings: a recipe for a combination of foods cooked together in a
slow over and the dish/pot used for cooking it. Casserole, as a cooking method, seems to have
derived from the ancient practice of slowly stewing meat in earthenware containers. Medieval pies
are also related, in that pastry was used as a receptacle for slowly cooking sweet and savory
fillings. Early 18th century casserole recipes [the word entered the English language in 1708]
typically employed rice which was pounded and pressed (similar to the pastry used for pies) to
encase fillings. Like their Medieval ancestors, they were both savory and sweet. The casseroles
we know today are a relatively modern invention. Casserole cookery is known in other cultures
and cuisines as well: the tagines of Morocco and the mud-encrusted Beggar's Chicken of China
are two examples. <a href="foodfaq.html#tunanoodle">Tuna noodle</a>, <a href="foodfaq.html#grenbeen">Green bean</a> &

Some brief notes on history:
<p>
"Casserole....The word has a complicated history, starting with a classical Greek term for a cup
(kuathos), progressing to a Latin word (cattia), which could mean both ladle and pan, then
becoming an Old French word (casse...), which then became casserole...Historically, casserole
cookery has been especially popular in rural homes, where a fire is in any case burning all day and
every day...Although casserole is a western term, the use of cooking pots which would be called
casseroles in Europe or Americas is almost universal in Asia."<br>
---<i>The Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] (p.
143)
<p>
"Casserole...perhaps the most remarkable aspect of its history is the complete and sudden change
in the dish it refers to that has taken place within the past hundred years. When English took it
over from French at the beginning of the eighteenth century it meant a dish of cooked rice
moulded into the shape of a casserole cooking pot and then filled with a savoury mixture, say of
chicken or sweetbreads. It was also applied by extension to a border of rice, or even of mashed
potato, round some such dish as fricasee or curry...Then some time around the 1870s this sense of
casserole seems to have slipped inperceptibly by swiftly into a  dish of meat, vegetable, and stock
or other liquid, cooked slowly in the oven in a closed pot', its current sense...The word seems not
to have been used as a verb in English until after the First World War:  It seemed a shame to
casserole [the chicken], for it would  ave roasted beautiful' (Dorothy Sayers, <i>Strong
Poison</i>, 1930)."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 60-1)
<p>
"Casserole: A dish or pot made from a material such as glass, cast iron, aluminum, or
earthenware in which food is baked and, often, served. The word, which may also refer to the
food itself...is from the French and was first printed in English in 1708....Cooking in such dishes
has always been a part of most nation's gastronomy, but the idea of casserole cooking as a 
one-dish meal became popular in America in the twentieth century, especially in the 1950s when
new
forms of lightweight metal and glassware appeared on the market. The virtues of easy-to-prepare
meals were increasingly promoted in the women's magazines of the era, thereby supposedly
freeing the housewife from the lengthy drudgery of the kitchen....By the 1970s  casserole
cookery took on a less-than sophisticated image..."<br>
---<i>The Encyclopedia of American Food & Drink</i>, John F. Mariani  [Lebhar-Friedman:New
York] 1999 (p.59)
<p>
"Casserole cookery has been around since prehistoric times, when it was discovered that cooking
food slowly in a tightly covered clay vessel softened fibrous meats and blended succulent
juices...With the addition or subtractions of leftovers or inexpensive cuts of meat, the casserole is
flexible and economical in terms of both ingredients and effort. The classic casserole, a French
dish, was originally made with a mound of cooked rice. Fannie Meritt Farmer's <i>Boston
Cooking School Cook Book</i> (1896) had one casserole recipe, for Casserole of Rice and
Meat, to be steamed for forty-five minutes and served with tomato sauce. In the twentieth
century, casseroles took on a distinctive American identity. During the depression of the 1890s,
the economic casserole provided a welcome way to stretch meat, fish, and poultry. Certain items
were also scarce during World War I and leftovers were turned into casserole meals. The same
was true during the Great Depression of the 1930s."<br>

"There is no doubt that the fashion of cooking in casseroles or eathenware
dishes has come to stay in this country; and it is hardly a matter of surprise when the advantages
of this form of cookery are really understoood, whether it be actual casserole cookery, so called,
or cookery in fireproof utensils. Cooking "en casserole" is a term which signifies dishes cooked
and served in the same eartheware pot or utensil, though, as every one knows, the original French
word is the generic name for a stewpan or a saucepan. The old idea of a caserole was some
preparation of chopped fish, or vegetables enveloped in a crust of cooked rice, macaroni, or
potato. Properly speaking, however, a casserole is a dish, the material for which in many instances
is first prepared in the saute or frying pan and then transferred to the earthenware pan to finish
cooking by a long, slow process which develops the true flavors of the food being cooked. The
sooner the casserole utensil becomes an indispensable part of our everyday kitchen outfit the
better...When casserole cookery is thoroughly understood, many combinations of food and many
inexpensive viands will be put to use and very palatable results obtained."<br>

The expression  en casserole is frequently misunderstood, for the reason that the word casserole

cooked, but served on the table. The other usage of the word casserole is intended to describe a
case or mold, either of potato, rice or fried bread, inside of which is placed some preparation of
meat or vegetables. The word casserole in this case really signified a border or croustade and is
therefore more or less misleading. This latter form of casserole will be found in the chapter on
entrees. The casserole should be chosen with consideration for the needs of the home. There are
casseroles of every size, from the individual ramekin up to the largest size, which will hold a
couple of chickens; and of very shape--small ones with long handles, oval and round, shallow and
deep ones; in many colors--blue, green, brown, yellow and mixtures; of a variety of
materials--glass, vitrified china, earthenware, iron and aluminum....The casserole saves washing
dishes, for
the food is brought to the table in the dish in which it is cooked. Frequently, also, it contains a
 one dish meal which eliminates all but the one cooking and serving dish. It makes possible the
use of left-overs in attractive, palatable, and appetizing ways, the cooking tender of tough meat,
and an unlimited variety in the ways of preparing vegetables. ..Food cooked in this way requires

"Casserole and oven cookery.</b><br>
The expression "en casserole" is sometimes misunderstood because the word "casserole" is used
in two quite different ways by writers on domestic subjects. Properly speaking, a casserole is the
coarse clay saucepan, so common in France, in which meats and vegetables are not only cooked
but served on the tabel. In its other usage the word is applied to a case or mold of potato, rice or
fried bread, inside of which is placed some preparation of meat or vegetables. The word in this
case really signifies a border or croustade. Directions for using this second form of casserole will
be found in the chapter on entrees. <br>
<b>Varieties of Casseroles</b><br>
Casseroles of different sizes, shapes and materials, are convenient additions to the cooking
equipment, and should be chosen with consideration for the needs of the family. They come in
many sizes from the individual ramekin up to one that will hold two chickens. They may be had in
various shapes--oval and round, shallow and deep. They are made in a variety of materials--glass,
vitrified china, earthenware, iron and aluminum--and in a color-range that allows one to choose
according to personal preferences--brown, yellow, green, blue and mixtures.<br>
<b>Care of Casseroles</b><br>
Casseroles will last indefinately if properly treated. It is wise to avoid a sudden and great change
in temperature, such as occurs when a casserole is taken from a hot oven and placed in a wet sink.
It is not advisable to set a glass or earthenware casserole over a high flame without an asbestos
mat under it. A new casserole may be tempered and made more tough by pouring cold water into
it and about it, and bringing it gradually to the boiling point.<br>
<b>Advantages of Cooking in a Casserole</b><br>
THE CASSEROLE SAVES DISH-WASHING, because it makes it possible to bring food to the
table in the dish in which it was cooked. Frequently, also, it contains a "one-dish meal" which
eliminates all but the one cooking dish. THE CASEROLE MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO USE
LEFT-OVERS  in attractive, palatable combinations, to cook tough meats tender, and to preapare
vegetables in an almost unlimited variety of ways. Any vegetable may be boiled, steamed, baked,
scalloped or creamed, and cabbage, cucumbers, eggplant, onions, peppers, potatoes or tomatoes
may be stuffed and cooked in the casserole. FOOD COOKED IN THIS WAY NEED LITTLE
WATCHING, it may be kept warm and still attractive if the meal is delayed, and there is no loss
of vegetable or meat juices. These juices contain a valuable part of the food which is often thrown
away, especially in the case of vegetables that are boiled. A WHOLE MEAL MAY BE
COOKING IN THE OVEN in the casserole while the oven is being used for some other purpose,
such as baking cookies. The cover of the casserole should fit well into the dish, so that it is
practically aritight, a fact that should be borne in mind when the casserole is purchased. If the
oven must be kept very hot for something else, set the casserole in a pan of water so that the food
within will simmer, not boil. As the water becomes hot, take out part of it and add cool water to
keep it at the desired temperature."<br>

<font color="#003366"><b>Tuna Noodle Casserole</b></font><br>

Casserole, as we Americans know it today, is an economical meal. Food historians confirm
*modern*
casseroles were known in the 19th century. They  became popular in the 1930s when the Great
Depression
forced cooks to seek economical solutions to family meals. This cooking genre was continued in
the 1940s
(economic reasons) and 1950s-1970s (convenience reasons). <a href="foodfaq.html#casseroles"> About
casseroles
</a>.
Forerunners of tuna noodle casseroles have been composed for hundreds of years. In 19th century
America,  the meat of choice was typically the same as for salad-sandwiches: chicken, turkey, and
lobster.
Recipes for creamy casseroles composed of white sauce and meat and noodles/rice also appear at
this
time.  
<p>
Tuna was first  commercially canned in 1903. It took much corporate promotion to convince
home cooks to
substitute this canned product for *traditional* protein sources. If tuna salad sandwiches can be
used as a
"food barometer," this product was not readily accepted until the 1950s. 
<p>
So when did  tuna noodle casserole debut?  Some food historians credit the Campbell Soup
Company
[Camden NJ]  for setting the table. This company's Cream of Mushroom Soup was actively
promoted to
American consumers in the 1930s as an quick and economical alternative to homemade sauces.
Corporate advertisements, cooking brochures and cookbooks promoted casserole dishes. Tuna
noodle
casserole was among them. No, the company did not invent the recipe. It did, however, make it
famous.
The oldest <a href="foodfaq.html#campbelltnc">Campbell's TNC recipe</a> we have on file is c. 1941.
<p>
1920s casseroles were promoted as economical meals because they used cheaper cuts of meat and
lots
of filler. These casseroles required hours of baking. Tuna noodle casserole, on the other hand, was
a quick
meal assembled in short order from canned foods. Voila! Dinner is served.

<a name="creamofmushroom">
<b>ABOUT CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP</b><br>
Soup is ancient. So are mushrooms. A survey of historic cookbooks confirms creamy mushroom
soups
were cultivated by several cultures and cuisines, mostly Northern European.  "Cream of
Mushroom Soup,"
as we Americans know it today, traces its roots to these "Old World" traditions. Many early 20th
century
American cookbooks contain recipes for Cream of Mushroom Soup. Period articles published in
the<i>
New York Times</i> confirm the popularity of creamy mushroom soups served at the beginning
of a meal.
The practice of using manufactured soups (Campbell's Cream of Mushroom was introduced in
1934) as
"culinary substitutes" took hold in the 1930s. The Great Depression was all about saving money. 
Canned
"Cream of Mushroom" happened to be in the right place at the right time.
<p>
"For most of its early history, the [Campbell] company's list of soups remained remarkably
stable...In the
mid-thirties, however, the manufacture of six soups of the original twenty-one soups was
discontinued. Not
surprisingly, these were, to the taste of the average American, some of the more exotic: Julienne,
Printanier, Mulligatawny, Mutton, Tomato Okra, and Vermicelli-Tomato. Taking the place of
these soups
were, among others, Chicken Noodle, Cream of Mushroom, Bean with Bacon, and Vegetarian.
Of them,
Cream of Mushroom was the most significant in terms of the changing state of the Campbell
company.
Shortly after the introduction of the initial lines of Campbell's condensed soups, it was suggested
that,
because of their extreme concentration, a single can of undiluted soup could double as a sauce or
stock.
"Many times," the booklet <i>Helps for the Hostess</i> stated, "unattractive left-overs are
thrown away
when, by using a can of Campbell's Soup, they could have been made into an attractive,
appetizing dish."
The booklet gave them what Escoffier would have termed the "culinary operation" to be
followed:<br><blockquote>

<b>"The general rule for making Campbell's sauces is:</b><br>
1 cup Campbell's Soup<br>
1 tablespoon butter<br>
1 tablespoon flour.<br>
Melt butter, add flour, blend, and pour in soup. Then add chopped leftovers and serve in one of
various ways.
Use on toast with rice; with pastry shell or vol-au-vent, or bake and scallop in oven for a few
minutes; or
pour over macaroni or noodles.
</blockquote>
<br>
"Campbell's Soup very much resembled Continental stocks and sauces, and the Joseph Campbell
Company suggested their use as such...During the first thirty years of  its history, Campbell quite
sparingly
published recipes that used soup as a sauce, and when it did, Tomato Soup was usually called
for...The
use of soup took a huge leap forward, however, when Campbell introduced Cream of Mushroom
Soup in
1934. Like Tomato, Cream of Mushroom was both an eating and cooking soup. More
importantly, its use in
sauces was easy for the American housewife to understand. One of the most popular recipes was
Cream
of Mushroom gravy, which used the soup as a thickener of sorts: Add to the drippings of a roast
beef one-half water, and scrape the brown from the sides of the pan. Add one can of Campbell's
Cream of
Mushroom Soup and stir until well blended and smooth. Bring to a boil and serve piping hot. It
may be
made thinner, if desired, by adding more water. This makes an excellent gravy for roast beef and
is far
superior to the usual brown gravy....Housewives agreed that it did make an excellent gravy, and
Cream of
Mushroom became the first Campbell's Soup to be widely used as a sauce...This shift in the use of
soup
turned out to be one of the most consequential in the company's history, the sales of cooking soup
such as
Cream of Mushroom eventually growing to around 30 percent of the company's business."<br>

<b>ABOUT PROMOTING CANNED SOUPS AS EASY SAUCE FOR FAMILY
MEALS</b><br>
"The home economists also were responsible for writing Campbell cookbooks. In 1942, with the
publication
of Easy Ways to Good Meals by Ann Marshall, later replaced by Carolyn Campbell, the noms de
plume of
the collective home economics department, Campbell began a run of increasingly longer and more
complete cookbooks. By the 1950s about a million of these were in print at any one time,with
titles such as
<i>Cooking with Condensed</i>, <i>Wonderful Ways with Soups</i>, and <i>Campbell's
Treasury of
Recipes</i>...Most young American woemn, who had been taught to cook by their mothers, had
no idea
how to make sauce. ..The wide circulation of Campbell cookbooks changed that. With one of
these simple
recipes in hand, the housewife could, by opening a can of Campbell's Soup, make a "Perfect Tuna
Casserole...Stripped of its now-famous name, Perfect Tuna Casserole was no more or less than
fish
cooked in white sauce, the top of which has been gratineed, or made crispy. The same is generally
true of
many of the other famous Campbell dishes of the era..."<br>

Any meat may be cooked en casserole. This type of cooking is especially adaptable to the cheaper

stew. The
time of cookery varies with the type of meat--the cheaper cuts need from three to four hours,
more tender
meats one and one half to two hours. Vegetables, rice, macaroni, or spaghetti are added to meats
in
casserole cooking, extending them so that it is really a one-dish meal. Meats suitable for casserole

<b>Green Bean Casserole</b> (aka Green Bean Bake)<br>
Culinary evidence confirms vegetables served with cream sauce were consumed in Medieval Europe. Think: <a href="foodfaq.html#creammed onion">creamed onion</a>.
Recipes evolved according to local taste and custom. They were introduced to our country by the people
who settled here and adapted according to technological advancement and public sentiment. American
cookbooks printed in the 19th/early 20th centuries often contained recipes combining green beans and
other vegetables (fresh, canned, frozen) with creamy sauces (sour cream, heavy cream, grated cheese,
salad dressings, soups). Some were baked (en casserole). Many included other vegetables (mushrooms,
onions, peppers) and were topped with crisped carbohydrates (breadcrumbs, toasted onions).
<p>
The "classic" green bean casserole recipe many Americans remember
was a mid-'50s brainchild of the Campbell Soup Company (Camden, NJ). It was a perfect marriage of
product promotion (condensed mushroom soup, frozen/canned vegetables), extant culinary traditions
(many housewives already served green beans in sauce), economic reality (inexpensive, belly-filling,
easily assembled foods) and social craving (creamy, rich comfort dishes). 
Campbell's didn't "invent" green bean casserole. They capitalized on it. Score another hit for
<a href="foodfaq.html#creamofmushroom">Cream of Mushroom Soup</a>. 
<p>
Modern American green bean casserole is a lesson in heritage and enterprise. Stir the collective melting
pot and sample what bubbles up.

<b>Johnny Marzetti</b><br>
Food historians confirm baked dishes composed of pasta, sauce, meat, and spices have been enjoyed since ancient Rome. Recipes and ingredients vary according 
to local taste and period. Many of these dishes were introduced to America via France and Italy. Some of these dishes were "Americanized" in the 20th century.
 Such is probably the case with Johnny Mazetti (aka baked spaghetti or spaghetti casserole). Classic Italian cookbooks generally serve thin pasta products 
(spaghetti, cappelini) with sauce on top. Thicker, sturdy pasta shapes (ziti, shells, cannelloni, ravioli, lasagne) are sometimes stuffed and generally baked. Ricotta and
 mozzarella, and pecorino romano are the classic cheeses of choice. 
<p>
Mainstream American cookbooks disregard these traditions, directing cooks to bake
 all shapes with whatever cheese they on hand. The most Americanized Marzetti-style recipes call for processed cheese, ground hamburger, and canned soup.
<p>
Our survey of American cookbooks and newspapers reveal this "Italian inspired" casserole appealed to 20th century home cooks from the Great Depression through the 1970s. Baked spaghtetti casseroles are found under a variety of creative names including "Roman Holiday" and "Baked Spaghetti en Casserole" (Frenchifying it?). The earliest Marzetti moniker we found (Mazetti, actually) was published in a syndicated column distributed to local American newspapers in 1940. While print evidence confirms
Johnny Marzetti" remains the most popular title, it has been know by several "sounds like" aliases: Mazetti, Mousseti, Mozzeti, and Johnnie, and JM. Ingredients and method reflect local taste and standard feature on school lunch menus, church dinners, "blue plate" restaurants and pot lucks. We can confirm a strong Ohio connection but have not yet found anyone claiming credit for creation.
<p>
<b>Who was Johnny Marzetti?</b><br>
One food historian states:<br>
"Johnny Marzetti. Also "Johnny Mazetti." A baked dish of ground meat, tomato, and macaroni. It was created at the Marzetti Restaurant in Columbus, Ohio, in the 
1920s, and named after the owner's brother, Johnny."<br> 
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 173) <br>
[NOTES: (1) The Ancestry.com genealogy database returns several people with this name; some in Columbus OH area. (2)
Marzetti company, est. 1896, still exists in Columbus. There is no claim to origination on their Web site.]<br>
<p>
We wonder. Is it possible the dish was named after the maracroni shape?
World War II era corporate cooking brochures reveal the names of different macaroni shapes to American consumers. Some provide 
Italian names (La Rosa); others the Americanized equivalents (Muellers). The 1942 editon of <i>101 Ways to Prepare
Macaroni</i>, La Rosa offers two names that are strikingly similar to "Marzetti." They are: Mezzani (macaroni) and 
Maruzzelli (shells) (p. 7). This book offers a recipe for "Left-Over Meat Sauce," a baked meat & tomato casserole, featuring Maruzelli (p. 29).

title: "Roman Holiday."...The other day I came across the same entree which bore the title "Roman Holiday." I felt a trifle deflated at not being the 
originator, I was gratified to realize that it was a tested recipe of high repute. "Roman Holiday" is so appetizing and easy to prepare that it will probably give Forum readers 
a mental holiday when they start planning for an unexpected dinner crowd from the office. "Parboil one package of spaghetti, drain, and place half in the bottom of a

next layer. Alternate a layer of the remaining spaghetti with the other half of packaged cheese. Season to taste and pour small can of tomato juice over all. This creates 
enough rich liquid to mix the ingredients while cooking. I bake this casserole just long enough to produce a thoroughly blended flavor. The formal recipe for 
"Roman Holiday" calls for an addition of bacon drippings, onions, and about a pound of hamburger rather than left-over meat, but my friends and I like my original way best." <br>

Cauliflower is a cultivated member of the cabbage family. Like <a href="foodfaq.html#broccoli">broccoli</a>, the flowering stalks are consumed.
While the base vegetable is generally white, colorful variations have been introduces. 
<a href="foodfaq.html#orangecauliflower">Orange cauliflower</a> was introduced in the mid-1970s. Purple and green variations also exist.
<p>

"The cauliflower (Brassica oleracea car. Botrytis), another-and many would say the most elegant-member
of the sprawling cabbage family, is a direct descendant of the original wild cabbage and a close relative of
broccoli. The kind of cauliflower usually found in vegetable hors d'oeuvres has a white head, achieved by
growers who cover the flower head in its outer leaves so as to block sunlight and, thus, prevent the
formation of chlorophyll...The cauliflower (the name is probably from the Italian caolifliori, meaning
"cabbage flowers") was apparently known in much of Europe during the Middle Ages, but then
disappeared and had to be reintroduced to the rest of the Continent in the sixteenth century. This was
accomplished by the Italians, probably from Cyprus, where the plant had reached from Asia."<br>

"...prototypes of the cauliflower may have originated spontaneiously in different places. Selective breeding
would then have produced the present forms...the origin of the cauliflower and its relatives is obscure. It is
thought that they were first grown in the Near East, but no is sure when. The belief of Cypriots that the
cauliflower originated in Cyprus derives tenuous suppoert from the old French name for it, chou de Chypre
(Cyprus cabbage)."<br>

"Cauliflower. England was introduced to the cauliflower towards the end of the sixteenth century. It seems
originally to have been developed by the Arabs, and had not actually arrived in main and Europe until
earlier in the same century. This accounts for its lack of an ancient,  'ancestral' name. The words for it in
most European languages are variations on the notion  flowering cabbage': German blumenkohl, for
instance, Spanish clifolor. The Italian version is cavolfiore (cavolo is Italian for  cabbage', and is related to
English kale and cole); this seems to have been adapted in French to chou floeuri, and passed on to
English, where the native cole,  'cabbage' replaced chou...In the seventeenth century the unfamiliar
element florie was changed to flower, producing in due course cauliflower."<br>

"In the time of Henri IV, Oliver de Serres mentioned the cauliflower reintroduced into France by the
Genoese at the end of the Renaissance, but the vegetable did not become popular until the time of Louis
XIV, who liked it cooked in stock, seasoned with nutmeg, and served with fresh butter."<br>

"Cauliflower...is one of the cultivated varieties of the cabbage plant. The vegetable is picked in the bud
stage, before it blossoms, and only the florets are consumed...Caulflower may have originated in the
Middle East, and it has been growing in Italy since the fifteenth century. It was subsequently distributed to
other parts fo Europe and was cultivated in North America by the late 1600s. By the eighteenth century,
recipes were published in American cookbooks for boiling, frying, or stewing cauliflower; early recipes
were also offered for pickling, and pickled cauliflower was served when fresh vegetables were unavailable
and as a condiment. In the nineteenth century, cauliflower cookery expanded. Sometimes boiled in milk to
gentle its flavor, cauliflower was sauced, usually with a butter or white sauce, and served as a side dish
with meats; it was also sieved to make creamy soups."<br>

<b>Orange cauliflower?</b><br>
"On the plate!...It's a carrot. It's a sweet potato...No, it's orange cauliflower! That's the cry that may be heard someday in 
American households already trying to deal with purple broccoli, yellow peppers and red bananas. No joke. It's not a gimmick. It's
something Michael Dickson, a plant breeder at the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station has spent eight years developing. 
'I think people are always interested in something that's different or a new color,' said Dickson, who has been growing orange 
cauliflower for several years. The orange comes from a high concentration of carotene, the hydrocarbon that gives carots their color and
is converted into vitamin A by the body. 'It's not as high as a carrot or tomato, but it has 300 times the amount of carotene in 
white cauliflower, says Dickson, a native of England who grew purple broccoli in his family garden as a boy in London. There's 
a growing interest from consumers to try exotic and unusual fruits and vegetables, said Carol Bowman-Williams, a spokeswoman for Frieda's
Finest, of Los Angeles, which claims to be the country's largest seller of specialty produce...The new cauliflower, which looks like it has been drenched in cheddar cheese sauce, is easier to
grow, has a longer shelf life and is more nutritious. It tastes just like white cauliflower, Dickson says. So far, the orange
cauliflower has only been grown as an experimental crop at the agricultural station, although Dickson did take several hundred to a 
market two years ago to see how they would sell. 'It sold out pretty quickly'...Dickson started working on the orange cauliflower resarch after getting
some seed for a weak hybrid plant from the National Vegetable Research Institute in England. The original orange parent, a freak f
nature, was found in 1976 by a Canadian farmer in a field just north of Toronto. The farmer took the plant to Canadian scientists and
eventually some seed found its way to England. A mutated gene caused the orange color, Dickson said. After he got the seed,
Dickson returned to Geneva to cross the small, weak plant with a hardier, normal-sized caulflower and has had a great deal of
success."<br>

"Celery and Celery Root...A member of the parsley family, and native to the Mediterranean
region and the Middle East, wild celery...was one of the first vegetables to appear in recorded
history. From the writings of Confucius, we know that celery (probably wild) was in use in
China before 500 B.C. The ancient Egyptians gathered the plant for its seeds--used as
seasoning--as well as for its stalks and leaves, whereas in ancient Greece celery had a medicinal
as well as a culinary reputation. Two types of celery have subsequently been developed. One is
the so-called true celery (Apium graveolens var. Dulce), with green or blanched stems that are
eaten raw, sliced into salads, and cooked as a vegetable, and the seeds of which are still used as
seasoning. The most common variety is the medium-green Pascal celery, which was first
cultivated in Italy and, by the seventeenth century, in France...The other type of celery (Apium
graveolens var. Rapaceum), cultivated for its starch-storing root rather than for stalks, is
commonly called celery root or celeriac."<br>

"Celery, garden plant related to parsley, now usually grown for it s stem. Ancient varieties of
celery were of the strongly aromatic, bitter tube now called smallage or leaf celery rather than
the more familiar modern kind with juicy, blanched stem. Celery was, however, used as now as
an hors d'oeuvre (Apicius 4.5.1) and its seed was used as a culinary flavouring. Its use in
aromatic wreaths is far more prominent in the texts; a wreath of celery was the victor's prize at
the Nemean Games."<br>

This New World vegetable was known to the Aztecs. There are as many common names as there are varieties. Chayote

<b>What is chayote?</b><br> 
"Chayote...A member of the gourd family (Curcurbitacaea), this well-traveled, spiny vegetable 
(Sechium edule) originated in the American tropics. Called chayotli in Nahuatl, it was 
domesticated in what is now Mexico, was spread throughout South America after the Spanish 
conquest, and is now found in places as diverse and distant as North Africa and Indonesia. Such 
peregrinations doubtless account for its myriad names, a few of which are vegetable pear, 
mirliton, pepinella, xuxu, christophene, choco, custard marrow, and sousous. The taste of this 
usually green, pear-shaped, vine-growing vegetable resembles that of other curcurbits such as 
zucchini and the summer squashes; unlike these, however, the chayote must usually have it skin removed 
before cooking. Most of the parts of the plant are edible, and the leaves and vine tips are eaten as vegetables. The 
tuberous roots, similar to Jerusalem artichoke, are an imprtant source of starch. The fruit is used like a squash. It is boiled, 
baked, fried, steamed, stuffed, pureed in soups, and made into desserts; many consider the seed a delicacy as well."<br>

ornamental vine, but an abundant bearer. The fruit, if properly prepared, as the Creoles know so well how to prepare it, is a delightful dish, and is of a v ery much finer
flavor than eggplants, squashes or pumpkins. It may be cooked in a half dozen different ways, stuffed and stewed and fried, as the eggplant...or stewed or baked, like the

stone for the solving of the mystery. Soon information came on this point. The cho-cho is no other than the chayote of the early Spanish explorers. The 
original name was doubtless the Aztec chayotl, which has been changed repeatedly in the many tropical lands to which the plant has been
carried. It is grown in warm countries around the globe, and to a limited extent in our Southern States. As soon as there is an assured demand for the
fruits they will be supplied to our markets from Porto Rico, where the plant grows in abundance...Were the statements as to its many edible and useful

 would seem like the claims of a promoter, or like some plant Marco Polo heard of in far Cathay, or Alice saw in Wonderland...In Louisiana the chayote is generally called
vegetable pear, and is cooked very much as it is in Jamaica. It may also be cooked <i>a la</i> Creole by parboiling, then cutting in half. Scoop out the

appear--is pear-shaped and weighs from a half-pound to a pound. The color is lime green through the entire fruit, and its
texture is crisp and fiberless. In the center is a large, almond-shaped seed that is usually left there and cooked with the fruit. It has a delicate, nutty
flavor. What to do with it? Well, the chayote can be eaten out of hand like an apple, straight from the vine. But it can be creamed, French-fried, marinated in salads or 
pureed with lime juice and cinnamon. Young leaves can be cooked like spinach. And the tubers can be cooked like yams. We'll bive you some serving ideas later. Is chayote
fattening? No. One 3 1/2-ounce serving, wtihout butter, has 28 calories."<br>

"Over the years I'd heard of the vegetable chayote, a member of the squash family. And I knew it is to be found almost all year long in the markets along Ninth
Avenue in Manhattan. But through some curious circumstance, I never sampled it until a recent visit to the Caribbean isalnd of St. Barthelemy. As a
Southerner, I am even more amused by this, for chayote enjoys a considerable popualrity on the tables of Louisiana in genenral and New Orleans
 specifically. They are listed on menus and in cookbooks there as mirlitons. On St. Bart's I was served chayote stuffed, potato fashion, with its own pulp plus 
langoustine in a light cream sauce. I was astonished at its goodness and the overall delicate nature of the dish. When I returned home I visited Ninth Avenue
to load a shopping bag with the vegetable so that Pierre Franey and I could expreriment with it. What we discovered was that the cayote...is infinitely 
variable in its uses. It is tender yet crisp when briefly cooked and used in salads and can be filled with any  of a number of savory fillings and baked. It can be fried, 
stewed or simply baked after being split like an acorn squash and seasoned with butter, herbs or spices...Some we stuffed with cheeese filling (Muenster is one of the 
best), other with a curry of beef and still others with shrimp in imitation of that langouste dish..."<br>

Food historians tell us the history of puffed foods is a legacy of "accidental discovery."  Ancient
peoples placed maize too close to the fire and Puff! Popcorn happened.  Puffed grain products
(puffed wheat, puffed rice etc.) were scientifically studied and subsequently "invented" in the
19th century. The invention of cheese puffs (puffed corn coated with cheese flavoring) was 20th
century combination of accident and science.
<p>
"The invention of the cheese curl (aka chese puff) was quite serendipitous. During the 1930s, the
Flakall Company [Beloit Wisconsin] that produced corn-based feed for livestock sought a way to
produce feed that did not contain sharp hulls and grain dust and eventually produced a machine
that broke the grain into small pieces by flaking it. The Flakall Company became successful
manufacturers of flaked feed. One day as Edward Wilson was working as a flake operator at the
Flakall Company, he noticed that worker poured moistened corn kernels into the machine to
reduce clogging. He found that when the flaking machine ran continuously it made parts of it
quite hot. The moistened cornmeal came out of the machine in puffy ribbons, hardened as it hit
the air, and fell to the ground. Wilson took the ribbons home, added oil and flavor and made the
first cheese curls. The company ran another flaker just for the production of Korn Kurls. By
1950, the Adams Corporation was mass-producing the Korn Kurl. There were dozens of small
snack companies that followed the Adams Corporation and produced cheese curls, with many
devising their own special shape...Today, perhaps the most popular cheese snacks are produced
by Frito-Lay altough they did not offer any such snacks until 1980."<br>

"Following the lead of popcorn, manufacturers puffed other whole kernels. The most successful
examples were in the creation of puffed breakfast cereal, such as Rice Krispies. The process of
extruding was invented by accident during the 1930s, Whip experimenting on animal feed,
Edward Wilson noticed that moistened corn kernelsm when heated and forced through as
"Extruder," puffed up when they hit cool air. Wilson cooked them in deep fat, salted them, and
ate them. Others liked them as well. And the result was a commercial product called K orn Kurls,
which disappeared during World War II due to restrictions on nonessential foods. After the war,
Korn Kurls were reintroduced by the Adams Corporation and became popular during the 1950s.
During the late 1940s, the Frito Company invented Chee-tos, which were marketed by Lay in
1948. This extruded snack is covered with an artificially colored powdered cheddar cheese. By
the beginning of the twenty-first century, Chee-tos dominated the puffed snack market..."<br>

<b>American icon?</b><br>
"One thing about which we Americans are proudest and also most embarrased is our talent for making
synthentic pleasures. Movies, theme parks, televisions: all provide amazing imitations of natural
experiences. When it comes to food, no other country on earth has devised so many wonderful
and elaborage methods for altering, emulating, and improving upon basic ingredients. From TV dinners
to Fizzies (tables that make water into soda pop), spray-on cheese to Pop Tarts, our kitchen shelves are
a bonanza of things designed to improve upon nature. Of all these products, few are as beloved, or as
emblematic of American ingenuity, as Cheez Whiz. In fact, Cheez Whiz was specifically created to
eliminate the defects of ordinary cheese. The problem faced by Kraft laboratory technicians when they
began working on a pasteurized, emulsified, homogenized cheese food product in 1951 was that cheese
clumps. When it melts, it can separate; it can disintegrate into gluey, oily wads of dairyfat glop that no
one wants to eat. Welsh rarebit was still a popular dish at the time, and it required melting cheese, so
Kraft's men in white coats determined to design a perpetually stable cheese for the rarebit trade. What
they invented was something greater than rarebit fodder. They created Cheez Whiz, a solution for
everything from old-fashioned rarebit to modern quickie nachos grandes. As of July 1, 1953, the day
Cheez Whiz went on sale across the nation, the clumping problem was history. In the tradition of
Velveeta, which Kraft had introduced int he 1930s as a new product better than plain cheese (because
"nutritive value" was added by scientists), Whiz improves on anything a cow and dairy farmer could
produce. So long as the cap is on the jar, it can be stored endlessly; it melts on contact with hot food,
thus eliminating the need for grating; and it is as smooth as a baby's bottom. Instead of being just one
monotonous kind of cheese, it is "cheese food," containing American mozzarella, Muenster, and Gouda
as well as the tastes of mustard, salt, and Worcestershire sauce, the preservative powers of sorbic acid,
and the distintive school-bus-orange use of food dye #A001M. When it was test-marketed in 1952,
housewives reported 1,304 uses for it, including spooning it into hot macaroni, mixing it with
vegetables
(as a way of getting children to eat broccoli), dolloping it on frankfurters, and spreading it on
crackers. They also liked the glass jar it came in (eight- or sixteen-ounce size), which could be reused
for jelly or even as an emergency drinking glass. Microwave ovens have made Cheez Whiz even more
convenient. Bombarded by electromagnetic energy for a few minutes, the stuff in the jar slackens into a
fluid custard usuable as hot cheese sauce--without a single pot or pan getting soiled. Gourmets despise
it (the don't like any processed cheese); but there are certain junk foods that cannot properly be made
without it. For instance, cheese fries to accompany a Philadelphia steak sandwich demand the silky -smooth texture if warm, runny Cheez Whiz. For pouring in a baked potato (as served in
mall food courts), it is de rigeur. And Louis Lunch in New Haven, Connecticut, were the hamburger
was invetned nearly a hundred years ago and where the finicky kitchen allows no ketchup on the
premisis, uses only Cheez Whiz, smeared on white toast, to make its cheesburgers."<br>

<b>Where did cherries originate?</b><br>
"Cherries come from any of several trees that belong to the genus Prunus and are part of
 the rose family...The cherry originated in temperate Europe and Asia, and doubtless
 wild cherries played a role in the human diet eons before the invention of agriculture
 and the beginning of recorded history. Our Neolithic ancestors extracted -and
 presumably fermented-cherry juice before it was discovered how to make wine from
 grapes."<br>

 "True cherries, of which there are several species, belong to the genus Prunus which
 also includes plums, peaches, apricots, and almonds, all in the rose family. Cultivated
 cherries are descended from two wild species: Prunus avium, ancestor fo the sweet
 varieties; and P. Cerasus, from which sour cherries come. Both are native to Western
 Asia."<br>

 "The cherry was first cultivated in the Near East, and the word for it in the Akkadian
 language of Mesopotamia was karsu. When the fruit reached Greece, it brought its name
 with it, and the form kerasos,  cherry-tree', and in due course this passed into Latin as
 cerasus."<br>

 "Wild forms of both the sweet cherry (Prunus avium) and the sour cherry (P. cerasus)
 grow along the eastern Mediterranean, especially in southeastern Europe and Asia
 Minor, the regions of origin for both species. The species name for sweet cherry,
 aviium, refers to birds, the agents largely responsible for the distribution of the seed and
 therefore the spread of both species...The sweet cherry apparently was first domesticated
 in ancient Greece. Although it has been cultivated for more than two thousand years, for
 much of that time it remained a plant for the home garden, not one cultivated for the
 market. Both sweet and sour cherries were introduced to America by early settlers in the
 Northeast and later were distributed into states such as Virginia and Carolina and then
 expanded into the Midwest and, finally, to the Pacific Coast. There, in Oregon, the
 Lewelling family introduced the Bing cherry. This popular, firm-fleshed variety, together
 with improvements in transportation and the advent of refrigeration, helped establish the
 modern sweet cherry industry by making it possible to ship fresh cherries to distant
 markets...Sweet cherries are primarily sold for fresh consumption, but they are also used
 in cherries jubilee, a classic dessert made of saucy cherry flambe poured over ice

Europe, evil spirits were believed to inhabit cherry trees. But most European myths about cherries stressed their connection with
 fortune and fertility...The story behind the German  festival called Feast of the Cherries reveals the cherry's connection to 
good fortune. In 1432, the Hussites threatened to destroy Hamburg, so the Gernans sent their children out in the streets carrying
cherries. This touched the Hussite leader deeply and he spared the city and feasted on cherries with the children. In Lithuanian
legend, Kirnis was both the guardian of cherry trees and the spirit of the cherry tree itself. The Japanese continue to believe today
 that blossiming trees are inhabited by a spirit, or kami, that exists throughout the natural world...the cherry tree entered into the 
Buddhist myth of Maya and the birth of Buddha."<br>

<b>Christmas cherries</b><br>
"Legend, song, and custom link the cherry tree to the Christmas season. In all three the cherry tree performs unusual feats in 
response to the power of God or the magic of the season. Legends. An old Christian legend, first recorded in the apocryphal Gospel
 of Pseudo-Matthew, makes the cherry tree the subject of one of the infant Jesus' first miracles. The original Latin text containing
the tale dates back to the eighth or ninth century. This version of the story tells of an event that occurred shortly after
Jesus' birth. Joseph, Mary, and the infant Jesus were traveling in the desert. The couple spied a palm tree and went to rest under
its shadow. Joseph worried aobut how they were going to find water. Mary expressed a wish for the dates she saw hanging high above
them. Joseph scolded his wife for asking for something so far out of his reach. Then the baby Jesus spoke to the tree, ordereing it
to bend down so his mother could gather the fruit. The tree obeyed...As the tale passed from one teller to another, many
variations occurred. In later version so the story the incident takes place before Jesus is born. Moreover, as the tale became
popular in Europe, the tree which Jesus commands to bow down changes to species more familiar to Europeans. In Britain, the newer versions of
the story ferature a cherry tree...The earliest recorded version of this story in the English language appeared in a fiftheenth-century
miracle play...Eventually this popular tale was set to music in the Christmas song known as 'The Cherry Tree Carol.'...In medieval
Europe a miracle play concerning the expulsion of Adam and Eve for the Garden of Eden was often performed around Christmas 
time...some...added cherries as a symbol of Mary. According to an old custom, Germans, Czechs, Austrians, Poles and other central and 
eastern Europeans begin Barbara branches on December 4, St. Barbara's Day. A branch is broken off a cherry tree and kept in a pot of
water near the stove. This premature warmth encourages the branch to blossom. Old folklore suggests that if the buds blossom on 
Christmas Eve, the girl who tended the branch will find a good husband within a year. Others interpret the Christmas flowers as 
signs that good fortune will visit the household in the coming year."<br>

Sea to the environs of Constantinople...In the north of India P. cerasus exists only as a cultivated plant.
The Chinese do not appear to have been acquainted with our town kinds of cherry. Hense it may be
assumed that it was not very early introduced into India, and the absence of a Sanskirt name confirms
this. We have seen that, according to Grisebach, P. cerasus is nearly wild in Macedonia. It was said to be
wild in the Crimea, but Steven only saw it cultivated and Rehman gives only the allied species, P. 
chamoecerasus, Jaquin, as wild in the south of Russia. I very much doubt its wild character in any locality
north of the Caucasus...In Dalmatia, a particular variety or allied species, P. Marasca is found really wild; it
is used in making Maraschino wine..."<br>

"The small, very sour marasco or maraschino cherry was originally grown near Zara, the capital of
Dalmatia (now in Croatia), where it was made into maraschino liqueur, now also made in Italy. The special
flavour of this drink is due to the stones being crushed to release the almond taste of the kernels, in
crontrast to kirsch, where the stones are left whole. Maraschino cherries in syrup are prepared by stoning
and bleaching the cherries, then adding syrup, bitter almond oil, and red or green colouring Glace cherries
are made by the more ordinary method of candying."<br>

<b>Modern American maraschino cherries</b><br>
Dr. Ernest Wiegand, founder of OSU's food science department is credited for manufacturing maraschino
(type) cherries in 1928 to solve a surplus problem. There is no claim to his having "invented them." He
does, however, deserve credit for initiating the modern maraschino food process (he developed a new
brining method), thus launching the industry in the United States.
<p>
"Retired Oregon State food scientist Robert Cain, an expert on preserved cherries, has a book on
his desk, printed in Michigan circa 1912, that describes how to make Maraschinos. Even then,
they were soaked in a bisulfite-based solution, he notes. Unfortunately, this briny bath robs
cherries of their color and most of their taste, so processors must season the treated fruit with
almond oil and dye them with commercial colorants. Those early Maraschinos were an unreliable
lot, notes Carl Payne of the Oregon Cherry Growers in Salem, a major producer of preserved
cherries. The recipes didn't always yield a tasty product -- which is where Ernest Wiegand,
founder of Oregon State's food science department, enters the picture. Some 70 years ago,
Wiegand was looking for a way to salvage surplus cherries, a major cash crop in the Willamette
Valley."<br>

We are finding several references to green maraschino cherries dating back as far as the 1970s.
Articles providing recipes indicate they were used in holiday foods, such as fruitcake. The oldest
reference we have in print is a recipe for Ann Mattiso's Fruitcake, "An Appetizing--and Classic-Gift for Holidays," Jean

Food historians generally credit Auguste Escoffier for creating Cherries Jubilee to mark Queen
Victoria's Jubilee celebration. There seems to be some conflict as to which Jubilee (1887? 1897?).
Charles Elme Francatelli (primary Chef to Queen Victoria) confirms the Queen's oft noted
affection toward cherries. Francatelli's recipe was meant to accompany venison:
<blockquote>
<b>"64. Cherry Sauce A La Victoria.</b><br>
Put a small pot of red currant-jelly into a stewpan, together with a dozen cloves, a stick of
cinnamon, the rind of two oranges, a piece of glaze, and a large gravy-spoonful of reduced brown
sauce; moisten with a half a pint of Burgundy wine, boil gently on the fire for twenty minutes;
pass the sauce through a tammy into a bain-marie, add the juice of the two oranges, and before
sending to table boil the sauce. This sauce is especially appropriate with red deer or roebuck,
when prepared in a marinade and larded."<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
Of course, dishes are not invented, they evolve. A survey of 19th century cookbooks confirms
both cherry compote and cherries preserved in brandy were popular items. Towards the end of the
century, elaborate chafing dish and flambe recipes (Baked Alaska, for a dessert example) became the hallmark of the best chefs and finest menus. Given this context, it was probably only a matter
of time before someone decided to set sweetened, liqueur-covered cherries "on fire." The vanilla
ice cream base was introduced later, probably inspired by the popular appeal of Baked Alaska. In
America, Cherries Jubilee quickly became a standard dessert item in the finest continental
restaurants. The recipe was quickly adopted/adapted by American home cooks who wanted to
impress their dinner guests. Cookbooks in the 1950s & 1960s almost always contain a simplified
recipe for this particular item. In the United States, flamboyant flambe dishes climaxed during the
Kennedy years.
<p>
"Cherries Jubilee were created in honor of Queen Victoria. Then, as now, the British public
delighted in every detail of the Royal Family's life and everyone know that cherries were the
queen's favorite fruit...The whole nation celebrated at her Golden Jubilee in 1887 and again at her
Diamond Jubilee in 1897. It was during the earlier celebration that Cherries Jubilee first appeared.
Curiously, the original dish did not call for ice cream at all. Sweet cherries poached in a simple
syrup that was slightly thickened, were poured into fireproof dishes, then warmed brandy was
added and set on flame at the moment of serving. Soon, however, Escoffier was serving vanilla
ice cream  accompagnie de Cerises Jubile to many dignitaries..."<br>

<a name="gum">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Chewing gum</b></font><br>
"Chewing gum," as we know it today, is a "New World" substance descending from Central America traditions. 
The substance that puts the "chew" in "chewing gum" is chicle. This substance is found in a family of plants known by
many names, including zapote and sapodilla. Early Spanish explorers noted native American peoples were chewing this
substance before they arrived. 20th century scientific advances gave us the full range of chewing gum products (shapes, 
flavors, sizes, bubble capacity, creative packaging) we enjoy today. Some chewing gums have become American icons.
Think: <a href="foodfaq.html#fruitstripegum">Fruit Stripe</b> & <a href="brandquiz.html#bazookajo">Bazooka Joe</a>.
<p>
<b>About sapodilla</b><br>
"Sapodilla, sapotilla,...sopota, zapote, chico sapote...are all names for the fruit of Manikara Zapota, a medium-sized evergreen
tree native to Mexico and C. America. The Aztec name xapot gave rise to the whole group of names such as zapote and sapodilla, the wide
use of which can be confusing...The tree, which also produces the gum chicle, from which chewing gum is made, was cultivated
in the region long before the arrival of the Spaniards."
---Oxford Companion to Food, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2nd edition 2006 (p. 693)
<p>
<b>First chewers?</b><br>
"...chew gum, the Mayans did; their habit can be traced back at least to the second century, when...they rolled up hunks of chicle
and wrapped them in wild banana leaves for an edible package...The chicle was the same used today in many gums (the thick and
creamy latex of the Achras sapota, more commonly known as the sapodilla), and was likely discovered centuries ago by a Mayan gatherer unintentionally
injuring a sapodilla tree while climbing it to collect some fruit...Perhaps the first Mayan gatherer popped the sapodilla latex
into his mouth as soon as th stuf thickend into a gummy mass when exposed to air; more likely time to find a use for the gum was to
be measured in centuries. At any rate, when the Spanish conquerors of the New World descended...they found descendants of the Mayans
and many other Indian tribes stoically popping their chicle gum...The Conquistadores even ascribed the gleaming teeth of 
Aztec maidens to their chewing gum habit....The Mayans found...that cultivated sapodilla trees did not produce as much
latex...[the] gathered most of their chicle from the jungles. Tapping the sapodilla bark, they coagulated the milky latex by boiling, 
chewing the velvety,
smooth and almost tasteless gum that resulted. The tree they named the <i>ya</i>, an obsolete name today, but their word 
tsictle became our chicle. When tapped from the tree, the latex was simply called <i>itz</i>, yet after being prepared it was
dubbed <i>cha</i>...'Chicle, or <i>cha</i>, was well known to the ancient Mayas...being chewed to quench the thirst and also as
and accompaniment of meals and to relieve excaustion.'"<br>

<p>
"The chico zapote, the fruit of the Manilkara zapota, the tree that produces the sap that used to be
made into chewing gum, was a delicious morsel, although we have no evidence that the Maya
chewed the gum the way the Aztecs did."<br>

<b>About modern chewing gum</b><br>
"Chewing gum...a confection of sugar flavouring, and an insoluble base which eventually is
eventually spat out and discarded by the user. Originally it was made from chicle, the latex of the
tree Manilkara zapota, which is native to Central and South America. A sweet based on a mixture
of chicle, sugar, and a flavouring (licorice or sassafras) was patented in 1871. By the end of the
19th century, several entrepreneurs were making handsome profits from the manufacture of such
items as Chiclets, Gumballs, and Spearmint Gum. The foremost of these, William Wrigley, made
clever used of marketing techniques and expanded the market considerably. The sweet became
popular in Europe after soldiers from the USA brought it in their ration packs during the Frist
World War."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford]2nd edition (p. 167)
<p>
"The United States chews more gum per capita than any other country in the world; Canada is
second. After them come the Latin American countries. Gum chewing is thus concentrated in
countries inhabited originally by American Indians; and it was indeed from the Indians that the
Anglo-Saxon colonists of North America and the Latin colonists of South and Central America
inherited the habit of chewing gum. In New England, the Indians masticated the resin of the black
spruce and taught the Pilgrims to do the same; in Central America, the Mayans masticated chicle
(from the Nahuatl chichtli), the coagulated latex of the sapodilla tree, and taught the Spaniards to
do the same. The first chewing gum produced commercially seems to have been that made about
1850 in the state of Maine, which, following the Indian example, was based on spruce
resin....About 1890 the United States, which had been importing chicle as a rubber substitute,
suddenly noticed that South American Indians chewed it, and decided to try it out in gum..."<br>

Bubble gum was invented in 1928 by Walter Diemer. He was employed by the Fleer
Corporation.<p>
"...it was an early-August morning in 1928 , and a young cost accountant named Walter Diemer
did the trick. The age of bubble gum rose like a shimmering pink sun on the horizon. Inspired by
his employer's search for a large, dry bubble that wouldn't explode and stick so fast to young faces
that parents would forbid it in the house, the 23-year-old Diemer was experimenting with a new
batch of bubble gum mix. He had no knowledge of chemistry; for more than a year he'd been
working by simple trial and error."<br>

<p>
<b>When was Fruit Stripe chewing gum introduced? </b><br> 
According to the records of the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov">US Patent & Trademark Office</a>, Fruit Stripe brand chewing gum was introduced to the American public September 22, 1960 by Beech-Nut. 
"Word Mark FRUIT STRIPE Goods and Services IC 030. US 046. G & S: Chewing Gum. FIRST USE: 19600922.

<p> 
<b>What were the original flavors?</b><br> 
Orange, lime, lemon, and cherry (see below). Some online sources mention "mixed fruit" as a fifth flavor. To date, we have not verified that information. In 1996, Cherry, Orange, Lemon, Wet 'n Wild Melon, and Peach Smash flavors were introduced. These are still sold in 2013. 
Bubble gum version was launched in 1996 with these flavors: "Assorted Cherry, Cotton Candy, Mixed Fruit, Grape, Wacky Watermelon; Assorted Cherry, Grape, Lemon, Mixed Fruit, Cotton Candy; Limited Edition Chewing Gum - Assorted Cherry, Orange, Lemon, Wet 'n Wild Melon, Peach Smash MANUFACTURER: LifeSavers Inc.

<b>[1990s] Reintroduction as "nostalgia candy"</b><br> 
"Yipes, Stripes" Joining the list of television commercial comebacks is Yipes, the Fruit Stripe Gum spokeszebra, back on the air this spring after 23 years. Although Fruit Stripe Gum never left the market, its commercials last ran in 1968. Unadvertised, the product maintained a small but loyal following. Then, in 1988, the brand was relaunched based on its strong sales per point of distribution performance. "Though unsupported and in limited distribution, Fruit Stripe was one of the fastest turning gums in the category," said Michael Terry, product manager for Fruit Stripe. "Its appeal was based on the gum's uniqueness and the wild, fun personality of the Yipes character." To help evaluate the product's positioning and its potential for growth, the company conducted focus group research with children. The research confirmed that children liked the gum because it was unique and different from other gums. Children also kept mentioning the same three specific things when asked what they liked about the product: it had four flavors in each pack, it had colorful stripes, and it had Yipes, the zebra on the front of the package. "When children were asked to group products by character, Fruit Stripe always ended up in a little area all its own," Terry said. "That told us that our concept of the product as unique was carrying through to our target audience." The first step in the program was to increase distribution. The company's sales force used the sales per point of distribution story with the trade to build the brand's distribution base, with gratifying results: shipments increased 110 percent in 1989 and 1990. By 1990, Fruit Stripe had become the fastest-growing sugared gum in the highly competitive U.S. chewing gum market. ..."I've been asked, `is this just another nostalgia product?'" said Joe Collerd, director of marketing/confections for Planters LifeSavers Company, which manufactures and markets Fruit Stripe. "No. Fruit Stripe is successful because it appeals to kids -- the kids of the 1990s as well as the kids of the 1960s. We had indications that the brand had potential for growth that was going untapped. This was an existing brand with a great deal of equity, which is worth its weight in gold." And what of the first generation of Fruit Strip fans? One, Janice Wood, now works as an advertising copywriter at Michelin Tire Corporation in Greenville, S.C. When Wood heard Fruit Stripe was back on the air with a new commercial, she spontaneously sang, in its entirety, the original jingle last broadcast when she was "very, very young." <br>

"The LifeSavers Company is adding a new twist to an old favorite -- rub-on temporary tattoos of endangered animals on the stick wrappers of its Fruit Stripe(R) gum brand. With each pack purchased the company will donate five cents, up to $100,000, to World Wildlife Fund (WWF) for the preservation of endangered animals and their habitats. The limited edition product will be available nationwide by mid- March in grocery, drug, convenience and mass merchandiser stores and will remain on shelves through February of 1997 or until supplies last. The endangered animal tattoos will replace the current tattoos that include butterflies, soccer balls and other items aimed at Fruit Stripe's(R) target consumers, kids ages 6 to 11. Nine endangered animals are featured in the tattoos including: Black Rhinoceros Blue Whale Hawaiian Monk Seal Jaguar Mountain Zebra Peregrine Falcon Orangutan Siberian Tiger Tasmanian Forest Kangaroo Fun facts on each animal accompany the tattoos. Packages of Fruit Stripe(R) will be specially marked with the WWF panda logo and a message from Yipes!, the color striped zebra that serves as the spokes-character for the brand. "Kids are excited about this promotion because not only are they helping the environment monetarily, but they have a visual to wear that signifies their support," said Cathy Snow, group promotion manager with the LifeSavers Company. Eleven promotional ideas for Fruit Stripe(R) were tested among kids ages 6 to 12. From them, the "Save the Environment" concept rose to the top as the "best liked" idea. "This promotion is a wonderful vehicle for inspiring the next generation of keepers of our natural world," said Ginette Hemley, WWF's director of international policy. Introduced in 1961, Fruit Stripe(R) is the only "flavor-striped" gum on the market and is a favorite among kids. Since the introduction of temporary tattoos in early 1995, retail sales of Fruit Stripe(R) were up 10 percent in the first half compared to a year ago as awareness and usage of the product have climbed to two-year highs among target consumers. WWF, a non-profit organization that works in more than 100 countries worldwide to preserve the abundance and diversity of life on earth, collaborated with the LifeSavers Company on the special endangered animal tattoos. The funds raised through the Fruit Stripe(R) promotion will go to save species in their natural habitats."<br>

This popular dessert has surprisingly little documented history. Food historians tell us
savoury mousse (finely whipped foods achievieving a "foam-like" texture) was an 18th century
phenomenon. <a href="foodpuddings.html#creme">Creams</a> (cremes) answer that call. 
Dessert mousses begin to appear in the second half of the 19th century. These were
generally fruit mousses. Early recipes for dessert mousses in English and American cookbooks are
classified with ice creams. Sarah Tyson Rorer [1902] states they are the same as <a
href="foodicecream.html#parfait">parfait</a>. Indeed, the method and flavors are similar.
Coincidentally? Chocolate mousse was promoted in the USA about the same time as <a
href="foodpuddings.html#mixes">chocolate pudding mixes</a>. 
<p>
 Food historians generally agree the French first began consuming and cooking with chocolate in
the early 1600s. <i>Chocolate: An Illustrated History</i>,  Marcia & Frederic Morton (page 15)
states that "chocolate was introduced to the French by the Spanish princess Anne of Austria, upon
her marriage to Louis
XIII in 1615."  About <a href="foodcandy.html#chocolate">chocolate</a>.
<p>
According to <i>The Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson  [Oxford University
Press:Oxford] (p. 516) "Mousse, a
French term meaning  foam, is applied to dishes with foamy texture, usually cold and often sweet
but also savoury and sometimes hot. The terms was in common use in France by the 18th century.
Menon (1758) has recipes for frozen mousses...Chocolate mousse is well known internationally.
Other mousses, such as those incorporating ham...or fish or asparagus, are more likely to be
found in a French context."
<p>
"A Mousse is a light frothy dish, usually eaten cold, consisting of a sweet or savoury puree
whipped up and set in a mould with beaten egg whites, cream, or gelatine. English took the term
over from French as recently as the 1890s. There, it originally meant  'moss', and indeed moss and
mousse probably share a common prehistoric source (whos ancestral sense was probably  bog').
The possible etymological connections with applemose, a now obsolete term for a dish made from
stewed pulped apples, are not clear; the semantic similarities are striking, but the likelier
explanation is perhaps that the element -mose comes from a primitive Germanic word for  soft
food' (represented also in muesli)."<br>

fire like a custard, then put in the mould and set in an ice cave until firm enough to turn out. A

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Chia</b></font><br>
Chia (Salvia Potus, Salvia Columbariae, Salvia Hispanica) is a New World plant used by the Ancient Aztecs in a variety of culinary applications. Early preparation
methods and food/beverage results were described by European explorers. We find no evidence of authentic period recipes published by the Aztecs. 
<a href="foodfaq.html#chiapet">Chia pets</a>, decorative clay sprouting pots with live chia seeds, are promoted as novelty gifts. 
<p>
<b>What is chia?</b><br>
"Chia, an American plant of the same genus as the common European herb sage, was grown for its seeds by the Aztecs in ancient Mexico, who used them as a cereal. The main species grown was Salvia columbariae, golden chia, the seeds of which were roasted and ground, to form a meal called pinole, then mixed with water so that the meal swelled into a glutinous mushy mess. This was eaten as a porridge or made into cakes. The name 'chia' is also applied to S. hispanica, Mexican chia, the uses of which are admirable summarized by Facciola (1990). 'When soaked in water, the seeds form a gelatinous mass which is flavored with fruit juices and consumed as a cooling drink. The shelled seeds can also be prepared as a gruel or pudding. Sprouted seeds are eaten in salads, sandwiches, soups, stews etc. Due to their mucilaginous properties, they are sprouted on clay or other porous materials, and clay animals or 'chia pets' are sold commercially for this purpose. The seeds are ground into meal and made into breads, biscuits, muffins and cakes."<br>---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2nd edition, 2007 (p. 167)
<p> 
"Chia--a species of sage that produces pods filled with tiny seeds, chia...long provided Native Americans of southwestern North America with a grain substitute. In addition, the Aztecs, farther south, used these seeds and those of a Mexican chia...to make a refreshing drink. The seeds are gathered much like grain and are then parched and ground into meal for baking flat breads and making porridges. Chia seeds were also often stored for future use."<br>---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kenneth F. Kiple & Kriemhild Conee Ornelas [Cambridge University Press:Cambridge] 2000, Volume Two (p. 1752) 
<p>
"The third tribute grain is chia (Salvia hispanica). Nowadays it is used to make a refreshing drink by mixing the small 
black seeds with water and then sweetening to taste. Every seed puts out a sort of mucilaginous coating, so that it 
resembles a very small frog's egg. This property of the seed is apparently an adaptation to growing in unstable soils, 
anchoring the seed until it has time to put down roots. The Aztec used the seeds to make some of the nourishing gruels 
that were part of their diet. Oil expressed from one kind of chia was supposed to be excellent for mixing with paint and 
using as a varnish, as well as protecting the legs and feet of hunters and fishermen who had to wade into the lake to make
 their living. As with all vegetable oil in the New World, one must always question how much of such use was 
pre-Columbian."<br>---<i>America's First Cuisines</i>, Sophie D. Coe [University of Texas Press:Austin] 1994 (p. 90)

<a name="citron">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Citron & Buddah's Hand</b></font><br>

"The citron is a thorny shrub or small tree that may flour and fruit at any season and is more
sensitive to frost than any major cultivated form of citrus. Though this grealty limits the region
within which it may have been domesticated, the time and place of earliest cultivation remains a
mystery. Citron seems to have been in a domesticated state in both India and Persia by at least the
middle of the first millennium B.C. Some authorities have suggested India as its place of oriign,
others southern Arabia...This may account for citron being the earliest citrus fruit in the
Mediterranean region...There is considerable confusion about the identity of citrus fruits
mentioned in ancient Indian texts or depicted in Indian art...Whatever the uncertainty, it is clear
that the citron or rough lemon, or both, played a role in Hindu and Buddhist religion....As for B
Buddhism...citron [is] "unmistakably recognizable" in at least three scenes from the lives of the
Buddha depicted in one of the famous Ajanta Caves at Hyderabad in central India...The religious
role of the citron or rough lemon is more clearly shown in the case of Kibera (Kuvera, a Vedic
earth spirit and later lord of the earth's treasures who was adopted by the Buddhists. Kubera is
often depicted as golden, and in one form always with a particular fruit in this hand...though
some authorities call it a citron and others, a lemon...
     "In China, one of the earliest references to domesticated ctiron (known by a name, kou-yuan,
associated with it until Sung times; now hsiang-yuan) seems to be that in Chi Han's fourth
century flora. The citron in question had fruit with a shape normal for citron in the West, and
highly fragrant. Chinese women, the account said, cut them into the form of flowers or birds,
then simmered them in honey for use as decorations on the banquet table. Chi Han writes of
citron being highly valued by foreigners, and of ten jars of citron being sent to the emperor as
tributed from western countries in the previous century...The above suggests that citron may have
been introduced to China not long before, there is nothing in the account to indicate that it was
associated with religions of Indian origin. Of special interest in this regard is the fingered ctiron
(C. Medica, var. Sarcodactylis), a highly-valued variety known in China as fo-shou ("Buddha's
hand"), in which the carpels of the fruit naturally separate and grow so as to look like
fingers...Not depcited in early Buddhist art in India, the Buddha's-hand citron is nevertheless
believed to have originated there and been brought ot China by Buddhist monks...In traidtional
China, citron was cultivated from the Yangtze Valley southward...with the Buddha's hand the
most common variety...Buddha's-hand citron was a popular pot plant and its fruit was symbolic
of happiness, wealth, and longevity. The tree and its fruit were highly-prized gifts, especially at
New Year, for they are believed to bestow good fortune on a household. The fruit was also a very
common art-motif in China...Of special note is the plate described and depicted by Yyetts...which
was rich in fruit symbolism: the peach for longevity; the pomegranate for numerous offspring;
and the Buddha's hand citron for happiness and wealth. The Buddha's-hand citron was a
sacrificial offering commonly presented in temples or at the shrines of household gods at New
Year and other times...Buddha's-hand citron also serves as an altar offering in Indochina...which
fits with the suggestion...that the ritual role of citrus fruit in China may derive form the non-Han
groups in the south. Though Kubera is a common figure in Chinese Buddhist temples, we have
found nothing to indicate whether he is assocaited with the citron in China.
     "The principal uses of citron fruit are as an ornament, a source of a pleaseant fragrance, and
medicine and food. One reads of people carrying Buddha's hand citron in their hands or placing
them on tables for their strong, delicious odor; of their being used to perfume clothes when
pressed; and of washing fine linen in citron juice...The rind is of greatest food value, and may be
eaten fresh or preserved, sometimes by drying, often as "candied peel."<br>
---<i>Food in China: A Cultural and Historical Inquiry</i>, Frederick J. Simoons [CRC Press:Boca
Raton FL] 1991 (p. 200-203)<br>
[NOTE: This book contains copious references and footnotes to scholarly sources on the use of
citron and China. If you need additional details ask your librarian to help you find this book and
the sources you need to continue your research.]
<p>
"The citron did not reach China until the 4th century AD. When it did, a freak form (sometimes
classified as var sarodactyla) developed in which the fruit was separated into five (or more) lobes
looking like the fingers of a hand. This variety, called of shu kan (Buddah's hand), was
considered a symbol of happiness. For this reason and because of its especially fine scent, it was
placed on household altars. Later it also became popular in Japan...Citrons are now used almost
exclusively for the manufacture of candied peel; the Buddha's hand variety is candied in China."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 187)
<p>
Candied citron is one of the most popular items served in Western traditional holiday foods. 
"The citron is a large citrus fruit (Citrus medica) which resembles an elongated, knobby lemon. It is
now mainly valued for its thick peel which is preserved in sugar and put into cakes and puttings. The
term citron was first used in English (as a French borrowing) in the early sixteenth century, when it was
applied to lemons and limes as well as citrons...but but the seventeenth century it was being reserved
specifically to the citron. The French word citron was modelled...on Latin citrus,  'citron tree', which
has of course provided the generic name for oranges, lemons, and their allies."<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 78)
<p>
<b>Citron/Buddha's Hand symbolism & lore</b><br>
"The Buddhists adopted Kuvera as one of their deities. Buddhist myths call the citron in
Kubera's and "Buddha's hand," and in China they call it fo-shou. This variety of citron has five
lobes. The Chinese revered it as one of the three sacred fruits--which they referred to as the Three
Greatest Blessings--along with the peach and the pomegranate. The peach symbolized longevity;
the pomegranate, fertility and eternal life; and the citron, happiness, wealth, and protection.
Buddha's true hand symbolized protection as well. In legend, Buddha cursed citrons because of
their bitterness; then, feeling remorseful, he transformed the shape of the fruit to resemble his
hand. Though the "Buddha's hand" citron was inedible, it had a powerful scent, and the Chinese
used the fruit as a temple offering it to the household gods. Hindus and Buddhists attached great significance to the citron, as did
Jews, who made this fruit a vital part of their religious observance. The Jews called citrons strogs, and they believed them to be
the fruit of the "goodly tree" mentioned in the Old Testament. The Jews accepted the citron as the goodly fruit at the 
turn of the Christian era. They also adopted the citron as a symbol of Jewish national and religious identity. The people
needed perfect fruits for ritual use, and they planted citrons from everywhere to ensure an adequate supply for harvest 
festivals. Citrons, or etrogs, distinguised Jewish Harvest festivals from similar festivals among other religious groups 
in the Middle East."<br>

<a name="coconuts">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Coconuts</b></font><br>
Food historians don't quite know exactly when and where coconuts originated. Notes here:
<p>
"Botanists disagree about whether the species originated in the region of the East Indies and
Melanesia, as most think, or
in  tropical America, as a minority have vigorously argued. The minority view is supported by the
fact that almost all the
coconut palm's relations are in America, the one important exception being the oil palm, which is
African. Yet the
coconut has, at most, an exigius history in Central America in pre-Columbian times; the evidence
that the earliest
Spanish invaders found it growing on the west coast of the Isthmus of Panama is uncertain; and if
it was growing there it
is odd that its cultivation was not widespread, since it is so useful. In contrast, the coconut has
been known in East Asia
and the islands for a very long time indeed; it exists in greater variety in that region; and there is
another evidence
(including the number of species of insects associated with it in the various regions) that it did
originate there, probably
in Melanesia. There is also an interesting diversity of views about the origin of the name 'coconut'. 
Child (1974) gives a
good account of these and comes down in favour of the etymology which commands most
acceptance, that 'coco' was
first used towards the end of the 15th century by Portuguese seamen, who applied to the nut, with
its three 'eyes', the
Spanish word coco, referring to a monkey's or other grotesque face. When Linnaeus gave a
scientific name to the tree in
the 18th century, he toyed with Coccus (coccus, berry in Latin) but settled on Cocos. It was also
in the 18th century that
the notorious confusion between cocnut and cocoanut began. The blame for this seems to rest
with Dr. Johnson, who
confused the two in a single entry in his dictionary (1755); and one still occasionally comes across
'cocoanut' when
'cocunut' is meant. The term 'coker-nut', an old variant of coconut, was at one time in commerical
use in the Port of
London, to avoid the confusion, and remains in popular use."<br>

"Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide as much information as one might want on the
coconut in prehistory. This is
because heat and humidity work agains the preservation of fossils, and thus there are is a dearth of
archaelogical
materials, coprolites, and biological remains on tropical seashores where the coconut palm is
native. Coconut residues
do not accumulate because the palm grows and fruits the year round. This makes crop storage
unnecessary and, in fact,
because of their high water content, coconut seednuts cannot be stored; they either grow or
rot...In 1501, King Manuel of
Portugal itemized some of its uses at a time when the coconut was first becoming known in
Europe."<br>

<b>How did coconuts get to colonial America?</b><br>
Excellent question! A survey of early American cookbooks confirms coconuts were available in
whole, fresh form. Not tinned or pre-packaged. Most likely, they were shipped from the West
Indies region. Food historians generally agree coconuts were not indigenous to the West
Indies/Caribbean region. They introduced to this  area after Columbus by European settlers. By
the 19th century coconuts, were growing in this area and were shipped north to the United States.
In the late 18th/early 19th centuries fresh fruits from tropical regions did not fare well on long
journeys. This may account for the traditional popularity/proliferation of coconut in the Southern
recipes. <a href="foodcakes.html#pineapples">Pineapples</a> follow a similar pattern.
<p>
"Columbus took vegetable seeds, wheat, chick-peas, and sugar cane to the Caribbean on his later
voyages; Columbia's second governor introduced the first cows that had ever been seen there;
settlers took bananas, rice and citrus fruits; yams and cowpeas crossed the Atlantic with the
slaves. Coconuts were introduced to the Bahamas, breadfruit to the Caribbean, and coffee to
Brazil."<br>
---<i>Food in History</i>, Reay Tannahill [Three River Press:New York] 1988 (p.220)
<p>
"Just when the coconut palm appeared on American shores is open to debate, but some accounts
tell that on southern plantations coconut meat was used for making the holiday dessert,
ambrosia."<br>

"There are coconuts in Florida today, but there were none then [1519], and even those we have
now are the result of an accident: the schooner Providence, carrying coconuts from the West
Indies, was wrecked off the coast of Florida in 1879; the nuts floated ashore and took root.
Though the Providence's coconuts came from the West Indies, it is almost certain that Columbus
never saw any there. The Spaniards reported fully on new foods enountered in the Caribbean area
and in Mexico, but none of them ever mentioned the coconut. There were coconuts in America
before Columbus, for they are pictured in pre-Columbian pottery, but they were on the wrong
side of America to be found by Columbus, on the coasts of Chile and Peru, suggesting that the
coconut, a great floater, had drifted across from the Pacific Islands."<br>

Corn bread was not invented. It was a product of cultural exchange and practical necessity. Corn
[aka maize] is a new world food. Native Americans were cooking with ground corn long before
the European explorers set foot on New World soil. The food we know today as "corn bread" has
a northern European (English, Dutch, etc.) culinary heritage. Why? Because the new settlers often
had to "make do" with local ingredients [corn meal] when their traditional ingredients [finely
ground wheat] were in short supply. When colonial American recipes carried the name "Indian" in
their title (Indian bread, Indian pudding) it was because one of the ingredients was cornmeal. 
About <a href="foodmexican.html#maize">corn & maize</b></a>.
<p>
This is what the food historians have to say:<br>
"Native Americans roasted their corn and ground it into meal to make cakes, breads, and
porridges...The new cereal was precious and helped the early settlers to survive those first harsh
years. ..Before long uniquely American dishes were being developed on the basis of this new
grain, including an Indian bread called  'pone' or  'corn pone' (from the Algonquin word    'apan,'
[meaning] baked) made of cornmeal, salt and water. This was later called  'corn bread' and has
been a staple of American cooking to this day...Once the [corn] crops took hold throughout the
colonies, cornmeal foods were everyday fare..."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani  [Lebhar-Friedman:New
York] 1999 (p. 96)
<p>
"Once the corn was ground to meal, the question was what to do with it. For wheat eaters, corn
was a punishement...In frontier America, as in colonial America, any form of bread made with
corn
instead of wheat was a sad paste of despair. How sad is reflected in the lowliness of the
names--pone, ashcakes, hoe-cakes, journey-cakes, johnny-cakes, slapjacks, spoonbreads,
dodgers--all improvised in the scramble to translate one culture's tongue and palate into another's.
Names got muddled by region and recipe as much as samp, hominy and grits and for the same
reason: the desperate attempt of a wheat culture to order by its own canon the enourmous variety
of pastes, batters and doughs cooked by native grinders of corn. <p>
     From the start, colonist put interchangeable labels on the generic native ash-cake, baked in an
open fire, which seemed to the people of iron griddles and pots and appalling reversion to
Stonehenge. Words slithered in the mud of translation, Narragansett  nokechick' becoming 
no-cake and  hoe-cake;  journeying cake  Shawnee cake or  every John's no-cake becoming
 jonny or  johnnycake. At the same time, these Anglicizations of hoe-cake and johnny-cake took
hold early and hung on late a symbols...of rebel identity...For those who actully cooked the stuff,
cornmeal was hard going. Not only was corn obdurately hard to pound even to coarse meal, but
the meal refused to respond to yeast. No matter how they cooked it, in iron or on bark or stone,
corn paste lay flat as mud pies...Heaviness was a constant colonial complaint, which cooks sought
to remedy by mixing cornmeal with the more finely ground flours of rye or wheat-when they
could get them..."<br>

<p>
"[In the] large stretches of the South, Indian pone was the more usually name for cornmeal cakes
while johnny cake was customarily made of rice...The earliest recipe that I find for Johny cake, or
Hoe Cake is in <i>American Cookery</i> (1796) by Amelia Simmons. It calls for Indian meal, as
do
all New England recipes, and is  baked before the fire, presumably spread on a propped up hoe,
plank, or stone...as the colonists had been doing all along. It must be understood that among the
scores of johnny cakes, pones, ash cakes, hoe cakes, bannocks, and even various fried cakes,
differentiation was not rigorous. Each colony, each community, had its own versions and names, a
tradition that faded as the iron kitchen range made all hearth cakes virtually obsolete..."<br>

<b>ABOUT EASTERN WOODLAND CORNBREAD</b>
<p>
"Boiled corn bread. After the corn has been hulled and washed...it is placed in the mortar and
pounded to a meal or flour. As the pounding progresses the fine sifting basket is frequently brought into
requisition...The
hand is used to dip the meal out of the mortar into the sifter. The large bread pan is often set on
top of the
mortar and the sifter shaken in both hands. The coarser particles are thrown into a second bowl or
tray and
are finally dumped back into the mortar to be repounded. A hollow is next made in the flour and
enough
boiling water poured into it to make a stiff paste. Usage differs somewhat in this respect, cold
water being
used by some for mixing. The stirring paddle is often employed at first, after which the paste is
kneaded with
the hands. Dried huckleberries, blackberries, elderberries, strawberries, or beans may be
incorporated in
the mixture, beans apparently enjoying the greatest favour. The latter are previously cooked just
so that
they will remain while or nearly so. Currants or raisins are sometimes used at present. Formerly
the kernels
of walnuts and butternuts were employed in the same way. A lump of paste is next broken off, or
about a
double handful. This is tossed in the hands, which are kept moistened with cold water, until it
BECOMES
rounded in form; the surplus material forms a core at one side, usually the right, and is finally
broken off.
The lump is now slapped back and forth between the palms, though resting rather more on the left
hand;
and is at the same time given a rotary motion until a disk is formed about 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 inches
thick and
about 7 inches in diameter. Boiling water for mixing is stated to make the cakes frimer and better
to handle.
No salt nor other such ingredients are used. The loaves are immedately slid into a pot of boiling
water from
the paddle or from between the hands and are supported on edge by placing the paddle against
them until
all are in. The bread paddle, or sometimes a special circular turning paddle, is used to rotate the
cakes a
little when partly done, so as to cook all parts alike. An hour is usually required for
cooking...Boiled corn
bread, while not light in the ordinary sense, is decidedly tasty when newly made. It may be sliced
and eaten
either hot or cold with butter, gravy, or maple syrup...Loaves of corn bread were frequently
carried along
while travelling, though parched corn flour sweetened with maple sugar was a more popular
material. The
use of corn bread for this pupose is indicated in the word "johnny-cake" from "journey cake." The
ash-cake,
hoe-cake, and pone are other European adoptions. Boiled bread...was frequently used as wedding
bread.
A girl cooked twenty cakes of corn bread with berries in them. These were taken to the house of
the young
man, where they were cut up and given to friends and relatives who were assembled. Bread was
sometimes made from other materials, such as beans and acorns...Baked Corn Bread...The name
signifies
"under the ashes cooked," and is applied to bread baked in the embers, or on flat stones placed
over the
fire. This seems to have been formerly in much favour. Its disuse is probably owing to the
abandonment of
the open fireplace and to the general adoption of European foods. The mixture used was
practically the
same as for boiled bread. About three-quarters of an hour was required for cooking. As the loaves
bake
somewhat more quickly on top, they were turned over to be evenly done. To tell when they were
finished,
the cakes were tapped with the finger, if not sufficently cooked, they felt heavy to the touch, and
when done,
felt lighter and more spongy. The last part of the operation was to wash them in cold water to free
them
from ashes or cinders."<br>

<a name="johnnycakes">
<b>About Johnnycakes/Journeycakes</b><br>
"Johnnycake. Also  jonnycake' and  jonny cake." A form of pancake traditionally made with
Rhode Island ground flint ("Indian"). The name has been in print at least as early as 1739, but its
derivation is very much clouded in speculation. Same authorities believe it may derive from an
Indian word for flat cornmeal cakes, joniken. Others think it a derivative of "Shawnee cake," after
the tribe of the Tennessee Valley. It is also possible that johnnycake is a form of the Dutch
pannekoeken, for a j could easily be interchanged for the p, and the world is often spelled
"johnnycake," without the j.  Most Rhode Island afficionados of the johnnycake--especially those
who belong to the Propagation of the Jonnycake Tradition--insist that the word is from "journey
cake" (1754), because it might be carried on a long trip, and the word "journey" is commonly
pronounced ias "jonny" in that part of New England. The traditional thinness and brittleness of
johnnycakes seem hardly substantial or durable enough, however, to pack in saddlebags for a long
trek through the New England wilderness. The society also states that a true johnnycake must be
made with an obsolete strain of Indian corn called "whitecap flint corn."...In Newport County
Rhode Island, johnnycakes are made commonly with cornmeal, salt, and cold milk; in South
County they are made with cornmeal, salt and boiling water, resulting in smaller, thicker,
johnnycakes than those in the north...The johnnycake became part of New England folklore with
the publication of a series of articles from 1879-1880 in <i>The Providence Journal</i> entitled
The Jonny-Cake Papers of "Shepherd Tom" by Thomas Robinson Hazard..."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New
York] 1999 (p. 172)
<p>
"Phillis was 'Sheperd Tom's' grandfather's never-to-be-forgotten, unsurpassed, now sainted cook. In searching the birht records of the
early 1700's, we find that Sheperd Tom's real name was Thomas Robinson Hazard, author, among other works, of <i>Jonny-Cake Papers</i>,
in which the superiority of Phillis as a cook is fully set forth. She was beyond question the finest...The following is Shepherd Tom's description of how Phillis made a jonny cake: 
<blockquote>
'Phillis, after taking from the chest her
modicum of meal, proceeded to bolt it through her finest sieve, reserving the first teacupful for the special purpose of 
powedering fish before being fried. After sifting the meal, she proceeded to carefully knead it in a wooden tray, hsaving first
scalded it with boiling water, and added sufficient fluid, sometimes new milk, at other times pure water, to make it a proper
consistency. It was then placed on a jonny-cake board about three-quarters of an inch in thickness, and well dressed on the surface
with rich sweet cream to keep it from blistering when placed before the fire. The cake was next placed upright on the hearth before a
bright, green hardwook fire supported by a heart-shaped flat-iron. First the flat's front smooth surface was placed immediately
against the back of the jonny-cake board to hold it in a perpendicular position before the fire until the main part of the cake was
sufficiently baked, then a slanting side of the flat-iron was turned so as to support the board in a reclining position until the
bottom and top extremities of the cake were in turn baked, and lastly the board was slewed round and rested partly against thehandle of the 
flat-iron. After a time it was discovered that the flat-iron, first invented as a jonny-cake holder, was a convenient thing to
iron clothes with, and has since been used for that purpose very extensively. When the jonny cake was sufficiently done on the
first side, a knife was passed between it and the board, and it was dextrously turned and anointed, as before, with sweet, 
golden-tinged cream, previous to being again placed before the fire. Such as I have described was the process of making and
baking the best article of farinaceous food that was every partaken of by mortal man, tow it, an old-fashioned jonny cake made of 
white Rhode Island cornmeal, carefully and slowly ground with Rhode Island fine-grained granite stones, and baked and consceintiously
turned before glowing coals of quick greeen hardwood fire, on a red-oak barrelhead supported by a flat-iron.'
</blockquote>
'From the latter part of this description, we find an important requisite in the grinding of the cornmeal...The millers of Rhode
Island took great pride in the product of their mills...This historical rivaly has come down the ages, and it was not many
years ago that in the Rhode Island General Assembly the best part of the day was given up to a debate between a miller from 
South County and one from Newport County as to the relative merits of their meal and methods of baking jonny cakes."<br>

<p>
"Every Rhode Island cook has her own receipt for Jonnycakes. An old Newport receipt uses milk
instead of water and calls for 1 teaspoon of sugar in the batter. A South County receipt adds 1
tablespoon of molasses and 1 tablespoon of butter to the basic cornmeal batter. Means of cooking
the Johnnycakes vary also. Visitors to Smith's Castle, Cocumscussoc, where Roger Williams once
traded with the Narragansett Indians, will see a long, narrow hardwood board onto which
Jonnycakes were poured and then set before the fire to bake in a reflected heat."<br>

wood ash to separate the hulls, called the "eyes."...If the corn is gorund more finely, or ground

"Eastern settlers hulled corn by both methods after cracking and pounding their corn in the
hollowed log mortars and wooden pestles they called interchangeagly "hominy blocks" and "samp
mills." But throughout the nineteenth century, American cooks north and south labored valiantly, 
and hopelessly, to squeeze the rich nomenclature of native corn dishes into the narrow confines of
hominy, samp and --worst of all--grits. Anglo-Saxon grytt from bran and greot for ground had
melded into "grist," which colonists applied generically to dried, ground and hulled grain. The
New Orleans <i>Picayune</i> only confused matters when it called hominy "the older sister of
grits," since it was the Indians who taught Creoles to thresh the hulls from dried yellow corn until
the grains were white. Grits might be yellow if the hull was left on, the <i>Picayune</i> specified,
but "the daintier preparpation" was white with the hull off. Plain hulled corn was "big hominy";
grits ground superfine were "small hominy"...In the North, samp (from the Narragansett nasaump,
or unparched corn, beaten and boiled) came to be indentified with coarsley ground corn however
it was hulled...Grits for many reasons became strongly identified, as they are today, with the
South."<br>

"Whole hominy or great hominy is the result of the alkaline (lye) process of removing the hull
form the kernel. But the word "hominy" refers to dried and hulled corn kernels, coarsely ground
and prepared for used in puddings and breads, in particular. The term "grits," or "hominy grits,"
especially in southern states, refers to finely ground hominy. Hominy grits, usually of white corn,
have been called "the potatoes of the South," so heavily have they been relied upon for starch in
that region. Hot hominy is simmered over a slow heat for hours with butter, perhaps cream, and
salt or sugar to taste. Grits for breakfast, served with eggs and ham or as a side dish, is a
long-established dish of the South."<br>

"When dried hominy is ground more finely than cracked hominy by not as fine as masa harina, the result is grits, also known as
hominy grits. The word has been used since colonial times and probably comes from the Old English, grytt, meaning bran, or greot,
meaning ground. Grits are also called grist or pearly hominy in some older cookbooks, probalby becasue they were ground at what
was known as a grist mill. Up until the early twentieth century, grits were purchased in bulk and could be procured in fine, medium, or 
coarse grind. These early grits had to be washed in several changes of water, soaked over nigvht or for several hours, then boiled in a 
much shorter time. Regular grits cook in about thirty minutes. More finely ground grits, so-called 'quick grits,' are ready 
in about five minutes. Instant grits are ready to eat as soon as they are stirred with boiling water. Like cornmeal, the best-tasting
grits--whether white or yellow--are stone-ground because the germ is in tact. Grits are still daily fare for much of the South 
(they were on the breakfast table every day of my childhood) and remain one of the region's most characteristic foods. Grits are usually
swerved as a breakfast side dis, often with a pool of red-eye gravy in the center. In South Carolina and Georgia, grits are oftn served for
supper to accompany shrimp. Like hominy, grist left over from breakfast were often added to a batter and baked on a griddle. IN 
<i>The Virginia Housewife</i> (1824), there is a Johnny cake recipe calling for 'small hominy' (grits) as well as one for 'an
excellent and cheap pudding.' This so-called pudding is actually a griddle cake of cooked grits, cornmeal, eggs, milk and butter. 
They were baked on a hot griddle and eaten with butter and molasses."<br>

"In addition to the use of corn a meal, southerners converted it into hominy and grits. Bthe were made form corn but the grains went
through a soaking process which removed the husk (not the shuck) from the grain. Hominiy consisted of whole grain corn boiled and 
eaten as a vegetable. When hominy grans were dried, ground into a coarse meal, and boled, the dish was called grits. The
preparaiton of grits varied depending upon personal preference, both hominy and grits were subjected to further refinement by immersion in
hot grease and fried. Contrary to popular opinion, neither grits nor hominy ever came close to being universally used in the
area prior to the Civil War. Both were common but, compared to the other uses to which corn was put, they were certainly subordinate. IN the 
twentieth century grits has come to be a common complementary dish to ham, sausage, or bacon and eggs for breakfast, but there is 
a little evidence that grits were used nearly as much as corn bread during the antebellum period."<br>

"Sofki, Sofkey. A thin sour corn gruel prepared by the Creek and other Indians formerly of the Gulf region, from corn, water, and lye. There are three kings of
 the liquid: plain, sour and white. The corn is pounded into a coarse meal, which is fanned in order remove the broken grains and husks. Two quarts of the meal are
 put into a gallon pot of hot water, which is placed over a fire and allowed to boil. A perforated vessel is filled with clean wood ashes, on which water is poured to
 form a lye. The lye as it percolates through the ashes drops into the meal and water and turns the mixture yellow. Water is kept on the sofki for hours a time, and,
 finally, after the mixture has become very thick, it is removed and allowed to cool. A half-dozen 'blue dumplings' (a very palatable cornmeal preparation) are almost
 a necessary accompaniment of a mug of sofki. Pounded hickory-nuts are frequently added to the mixture, and marrow too, to improve the flavor. The vessel which

"Corn was the year-round staple for the Indians, no corn was referred to so often as hominy, nor so confusingly. Each Indian tribe called it by a different name, or 
by several names: what was rockahomonie and sagamite to the Algonquin was atole to the Mexica, sofki to the Creek, tanlubo and tafala to the Chocktaw. English 
colonists muddled words and meaning when they lumped under the single word 'hominy' and number of preparations made from the fully mature kernels of any 
late-ripe corns but principally of the thick-skinned flints that Northern tribes called 'hommony corn.'...Anthropologist Alanson Skinner took 'Notes of the Florida
 Seminole' (1913) 'The meal [once taken from the mortar] is first sifted through an open mesh basket and then winnowed by being tossed into the air, the breeze

<a name="shorteningbread">
<b>About shortening bread</b><br>
There is some confusion regarding exactly which food is referenced in the old African-American
folksong "Shortnin' bread." Some food historians think the song was referencing classic <a
href="foodcookies.html#shortbread">Scottish
shortbread</a>. Others suggest the recipe was probably a simple quick bread (non-yeast)
composed of
flour (possibly cornmeal) and fat (probably lard). Which is correct? If the song was referencing
food typically eaten by 18th and 19th century African-Americans, it is unlikely the recipe was for
Scottish-type shortbread. Fine white sugar, pure creamery butter, and white flour were expensive. 
<p>
<b>What is shortening (shortnin')?</b><br>
<a href="shortening.html">Fat:</a> animal (lard, butter) vegetable & fruit (corn, cottononseed, coconut), compound (margarine).This creates a paste that is different in taste and texture from traditional bread
products. Scottish shortbread, pie crust, biscuits (including shortcakes)  and cakes and cookies all
call for some kind of shortening. The greater proportion of shortening to flour, the flakier the
product. The type of flour and fat used depended upon how much money the cook had and what
products were available. 
<p>
"Shortening. A North American expression for any fat or oil used in baking to make the finished
item short (tender) in texture. The type of fat used as shortening depends on the individual
recipes, and the term has the advantage of being neutral and non-specific. In the past butter and
lard where the most important..."<br>

<p>
<b>Which recipe was used to make the shortening (shortnin') bread referenced in the
song?</b><br>
We checked dozens of 18th and 19th century historic American cookbooks looking for a recipe
for "traditional" shortening bread. We found no such item. There were plenty of recipes for quick
(non-yeast) breads of many types combining flour (cornmeal, wheat) and fat (lard, butter), under
various names. Many of these recipes also employed eggs, milk, and molasses/sugar. Texture,
cooking method, and final product varied greatly.
<p>
According to the <i>Dictionary of American Regional English</i>, Joan Houston Hall editor,
Volume IV [Belknap Press:Cambridge MA] 2002 etymological evidence strongly suggests
shortening bread was "corn bread made with cooking fat, esp. lard," also known as <a
href="foodfaq.html#crackling">crackling bread</a> (p. 926). This book traces the term shortening
bread/shortnin' bread as printed in a variety of scholarly journals, linguistic studies, and regional
folkways sources. This book also notes that in the context of the American south, the terms
 shortcake' and  shortbread' also sometimes meant a combination of cornmeal and grease.
<p>
Given this information, it is easy to understand why some people think the song is talking about
Scottish shortbread. Unless you grew up in the South or studied historic southern foodways, it is
unlikely you would have any reason to think differently. The lesson here? Accurate food history
research sometimes requires a careful study of social context and regional linguistics.

"By the turn of the century, an improved understanding of the chemistry of foods eliminated yeast
for corn and demonstrated why cornmeal was better suited to quick-acting acid-soda mixtures and
to small forms like biscuits and muffins...Until baking powders were readily available and
understood, housewives and especially Southern ones leavened their corn batters primarily with
eggs. Just as they turned green-corn puddings into fritters and souffles, so they turned puddings
and breads into spoonbreads. Mrs. Bliss of Boston offered what we now call spoonbread in her
<i>Practical Cook Book</i> (1850) under the name "Indian puffs." Her proportion of one quart

<b>About corn pudding</b><br>

Food historians confirm Native Americans sometimes mixed maize (whole or ground) with other foods (vegetables, fruit, nuts). These
 compositions took many forms, depending upon the consistency of the ingredients and method of cookery. These included breadstuffs 
(fried, steamed, baked), porridges of varying thicknesses (samp), and simple combinations (succotash). Corn pudding, as we Americans 
know it today, descends from European vegetable puddings. Old World recipe meets New World ingredients. 
<p>
There are many types of corn of corn pudding. Colonial cooks made "Indian pudding" ("Indian"
meant using cornmeal instead of wheat flour) for dessert. They also made corn pudding (with real
corn) as a vegetable. This type of corn pudding was very similar to <a

"This reporter recently had the pleasure of visiting the big, airy mixing rooms of a local firm to watch the blending of ingredients for a popular brand of hotcake and 
waffle mix. They are boxed separately. Our first impression upon entering this factory was its gleaming cleanliness...The workers scoop dried egg yolks and whites 
from separate huge barrels; measure flour, sugar, dried milk and other ingredients on big scales. Each item is acccurately weighed before it goes into the enormous 
bowls where the blending is done by machine...The man who perfected the recipes for this particualr brand of hotcake mix, waffle mix, and cake mixes, is a 
perfectionist of the first water. He firmly believes that separate formulas make better waffles and hotcakes than a combination blend that can be used for either. We
 can recommend all of the mixes and they're best sellers in almost all grocery stores in the Southland today. It's abusurdly to make perfect pancakes every time with 
 product. And there's no better way to tease foks to the breakfast table for a hearty, nutritious morning meal than with pancakes, hot from the griddle."<br>

Which makes us wonder? Perhaps the term "hotcake" an uber-description for this general class of food. All of these items are served hot straight from the griddle. 
That might also explain why this term was selected for popular 20th century phrase "selling like hotcakes." "Selling like flapjacks" does not broadcast the same 
universal message. <i>Betty Crocker's Picture Cook Book</i> [revised and enlarged, 1956] offers several pancake recipes headed thusly: Pancakes QUICK BREADS 
Griddle Cakes...Wheat Cakes...Pancakes...Flapjacks...Hot Cakes...Flannel Cakes. (p. 86-87). All of her recipes are titled pancakes.

<a name="polenta">
<b>Polenta</b><br>
Modern polenta descends from ancient pulse pottage. Recipes varied according to place, period & people; ranging from thin soup to coarse bread-type items. 
The earliest ingredients (barley, spelt, peas, beans, etc.) were indigenous. Maize (aka corn) was introduced as a result of the Columbian Exchange. This particular 
commodity was easy to grow & readily adaptable. In all cases, polenta-type foods were inexpensive and easy to cook. As such, they were consumed by the 
poorest classes of society. <a href="foodpuddings.html#hasty">Hasty Pudding</a> & <a href="foodpuddings.html#pease">
Pease Porridge</a> and <a href="foodfaq.html#cornmealmush">Cornmeal Mush</a> are related foods.
<p>
"Polenta is a sort of thick porridge made from maize that is the staple carbohydrate dish of norther Italy. Its prehistoric
ancestor or inspiration must have been made from barley (the Italian word comes from Latin polenta, 'pearly barley'...the main 
ingredient of the verison made by the northern Italians, living amongst hills dotted with chestnut trees, was originally
chestnut flour. Then when maize was introduced from America, cornflour took its place."<br>

"The food of Italy is a function of the history of Italy. A major component of that history is the record of the successive 
arrivals, over a period of 3,000 years, of wave after wave of invading peoples. Some of them went away again, others stayed. 
Each new race brought with it its own customs, its own traditions and its own eating habits. Three of them in particular laid
the foundation for the Italian cooking of today. They were the Etruscans, the Greeks and the Saracens...Each of the three left 
behind a specific trademark. That of the Etruscans was a sort of mush made from grain which at times had the consistnecy of porridge
and at others that of crumbly cake. It does not sound like particularly inspiring food, but on it the Roman Legions conquered the
world. When the Romans took it over from the Etruscans, they called it puls, and later pulmentum. It is polenta today, and it is
eaten throughout northern Italy, on the territory once occupied by the Etruscans."<br>
---<i>The Food of Italy</i>, Waverly Root [Vintage Books:New York] 1971 (p. 4-5)
<p>
"The Roman Empire had indeed performed one important service for Etruscan cooking. It distributed it widely. The most
conspicuous example is that of the first universal basic dish which Eturia gave Rome, pulmentum, which the Legions carried
as far as York, England...Its modern descendant, polenta (now made with corn flour) is not
important in the cooking of Lasio today, nor of Tuscany either, but flourishes instead in what was once the northern fringe
of Etruscan conquest, Piedmont, Lombardy and the Venetias..."<br>

"...in tracing the history of Italy's resources and gastronomic products, we must not overlook the fact that throughout much
of this history grains played a consistent role in the nourishment of the poor, offering them an essential weapon in their daily struggle
for survival. In this sense, we must point out that the use of polenta, comre than any other food, reveals the continuity of 
Italian cooking, going back long before the Middle Ages, to the customs of the ancient Italic people who inhabited the peninsula in
antiquity. This was an important dish in the diet of the peasants since Roman times, when it was called puls and prepared with
spelt flour. Over time, spelt was used side by side with wheat flour, from which bread was eventually made, and with various
other, less valuable grains and seeds, such as barley, millet, foxtail, and sorghum, some of which were native pants and some of which
had been imported from other parts of the Mediterranean shore. Given their lack of suitability for bread making, these grains
functioned mainly to transmit and diversify the primordial culture of polenta...Legumes were normally associated with the inferior
grains, partly because they were cultivated alongside them in the fields, and partly because they had similar nutritional uses. After
legumes had been set aside to dry for a period of time, their floury substance could be mixed with grains to bake bread or more oftne
to make polenta or soup. A pulmentario, or gruel, of broad beans and foxtail millet...appears in a document issued in Lucca in the 
year 765, referring to the food distributed three times a week as alms to the poor. Similar use was made of chestnuts...Polenta and 
soup are foods of the poor. Yest even these 'poor' dishes, intended mainly to appease the pangs of hunger and guarantee basic
survivla, left significatn traces in the cooking manuals addressed to the upper classes. The dish of 'broken broad beans' recommended
by the Neapolitan writer of the Liber de coquina at the beginning of the fourteenth century is really a type of polenta made with 
beans, similar to the dish known as macco, widely documented as typical of the diet of the peasants. The initial recipe is quite basic
and straightfoward..."<br>
---<i>Italian Cuisine: A Cultural History</i>, Alberto Capatti & Massimo Montanari [Columbia University Press:New York] 2003 (p. 44-45)
<p>
"The word polenta derives from puls, a kind of porridge, of the Romans who originally made it
with various grains such as barley and millet. Once maize was introduced from the New World to
northern Italy, shortly after 1500, it replaced panic (foxtail millet), milled, and sorghum in the
Veneto and polenta evolved into what we know it as today. On story attributes the arrival of
maize in Italy to the diplomat Pietry Martire d'Angera who, in 1494, had brough a few seeds,
given to him as a gift in Madrid, straight from Columbus, by the Milanese Cardinal Ascanio
Sforza. Whatever the story, we do know that maize, popularly known as corn, was first known as
maizium...and that it was being cultivated in Polesina di Rovigo and Basso Veronese in 1554,
probably as a result of the suggestion of the Cremonese scientist Giovanni Lamo, who proposed
its cultivation...The first cornmeal in the Padua plain must have been an exciting phenomenon.
Here was this food that could be a startling yellow, looking fresher than any bread the peasants
would see. Some people believe that polenta is a northern Italian specialty, but polenta is as
popular in southern Italy, especially around Benevento and Avellino, where polenta and sausages
is a favorite dish."<br>

"Polenta, a kind of thick maize porridge, solid when cold, which is a staple dish in N. Italy. Its
history as a maize dish dates back to when maize was introduced to the region by the Venetians
from America in the mid-17th century. However, it is thought that even before then polenta was
being made with chestnut flour, and that in this form it goes back to antiquity. Moreover, since
polenta in classical Rome meant pearl barley, a barley version is probably lurking in the
background...Closely similar dishes exist in Balkan countries where maize was adopted as a
staple food. The Romanian mamaliga is the best-known example."<br>

"The other way [American] colonists conferred dignity on mush was to call it polenta. Mary
Randolph's directions in her Virginia Housewife (1824) "To Make Polenta" were similar to the
Pocumtu's "hasty pudding," except that Randolph sliced the cooked mush when cold, layered it
with butter and cheese in a deep dish and baked it in a quick oven--Italian style. We know that
she thought of it as Italian because she follows it with recipes for "macaroni" and
"vermicelli."...At the turn of the century Celestine Eustice outlined four polenta recipes,
including "alla Toscana," which initiated les puavres in the polenta mystique taught today to rich
Americans by expensive Italian cooking teachers. Here was the ritual of pouring of the meal in a
slow trickle into boiling water, the constant stirring, then the holding of the saucepan over the
hottest part of the fire until the meal was detached from the bottom so that it would turn out
easily onto a board, then the cutting of it into slices with a wire or string. Eustis's pauvres may
not have the cachet of Italian peasants in the American imagination, but he mush is the same. So
is the cornmeal, for there are even fewer stone-ground mills in Italy than in the United States...A
good reason for the polenta mystique, apart from the chic of copper pots and peasant cooking, is
that Italians during four hundred years developed a fine corn cuisine of their own. When
Columbus first brought corn to the continent, Italy was as suspicious as France or England of the
grain they called granoturco. But since it was the cheapest of all grains to grow, they soon called
it corn by the ancient Roman name for pottage, puls, or pulmentum, and thus polenta. By the
eighteenth century, corn had become a hedge against famine for the peasants of the northern
provinces and, for the nobility, a version of pastoral. Among the Palladian villas a "polenta cult"
developed, the subject of songs, poems...Lombardy became the province of polenta...It was
Veneto, however, which took polenta to new culinary heights in polenta pastizzada, layering of
mush with minced veal, mushrooms and cockscombs in a sine-tomato-butter sauce seasoned with
salt pork...The pride of the Veneto...was its famed polenta con osei--"fresh polenta, migratory
birds, wine from the cellar and joyful folk," in the words of an ancient proverb."<br>

"Semoulina and Polenta a L'Italienne. (Good.)</b><br>
<i>To serve instead of Maccaroni.</i><br>
Throw into a quart of milk, when it is fast boiling, half a teaspoonful of salt, and then shake lightly into it five ounces of the <i>best</i>
semoulina; stir the milk as this is added, and continue to do so from eight to ten minutes, letting the mixture boil gently during
this time. It should be very thick, and great care must be take to prevent its sticking to the saucepan, which should be placed over
a clear fire on a bar or trivet, but not <i>upon</i> the coals. Pour the semoulina, when it is done, into a basin, or a plain mould which it will not fill by an 
inch or two, and let it remain some hours in a cool place, that it may become perfectly cold; it will then turn out quirte solid, and like a pudding in 
appearance. Cut it with a large, sharp, carving-knife, or a bit of thin wire, into half-inch slices; wash the basin into
which it was poured at first, and butter it well; grate from six to eight ounces of good cheese (Parmesan, or any other), and mix with it 
a half-teaspoonful of cayenne, and twice as much pounded mace; clairy from two to three ounces of fresh butter, and put a small quantity into
the basin, strew in a little of the cheese, moisten it with some drops of butter, and plce the second slice upon it; then more cheese and butter, and
continue this until all the semoulina is replaced with the basin; put plenty of cheese upon the top, add the remainder of 
the clarified butter, and bake the mixture for about half an hour in a gentle oven. It should be of a fine golden colour when
served. Turn it carefully into a dish, and send it instantly to table. A little rich brown gravy poured round might, to some
tastes, improve it, but it is excellent without, and may be substituted for maccaroni, which it much resembles in flavour. It may be
enriched by addding butter to the milk or by mixing with it a portion of creamn; and it may be browned in a Dutch oven, when no other
is in use. In Italy the flour of Indian corn, which is much grown there, and eaten by all ranks of people, is used for this dish; but
semoulina is perhaps rather better suited to English taste and habits of diet, from being somewhat lighter and more delicate. The
maize-flour imported from Italy is sold at the foreign warehouses here under the name of <i>polenta</i>, though that properly speaking is, we believe, 
a boiled or stewed preparation of it, which forms the most common food of the poorer classes of the inhabitants of many of the 
Italian states. It seems to us superior in quality to the Indian corn flour grown in America.<br>

pasty board, leveling it to the thickness of about two fingers. Once cooled, cut into losenge shapes 1/2 a cenitimeter wide (about
1/5 of an inch), while you will arrange as follows in a preheated metal or porcelain baking dish. Prepare a sauce like that for macaroni

spread a layer of polenta on top of the cheese. Add more Parmesan, some sauce and bechamel; place a second layer of polenta on top of the 
first and season as before; repeat the operation until you run out of ingredients. It is not a bad idea to add small pats of
butter here and there. However, do not put too much if you do not want the dish to turn out too heavy from too many condiments.

<a name="cornstarch">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Corn starch</b></font><br>
Food historians tell us starches of many kinds have been employed by cooks throughout time.
These were made from many natural foods such as wheat (flour), tapioca (cassava), arrowroot
(same) and corn (maize). While Native Americans appreciated the thickening properties of ground maize (corn),
the scientific ability to isolate/extract the starch from this plant did not occur until the mid-19th century. Alfred
Bird's custard powder [1837] employed cornflour as thickening agent. We do not, however, find print evidence crediting him with
the scientific discovery of extracting starch from the flour. This credit generally goes to Thomas Kingsford, 1842. 

<p>
<b>[1837] Alfred Bird </b><br>
"What is abundantly clear is the importance in all this of the invention of custard powder. This product is not a dried form of
real custard. It consists mainly of cornflour and sugar, coloured and flavoured, to which hot milk is added to make a sauce.
It was invented by Alfred Bird, who opened a shop in Birmingham in 1837 under the sign 'Alfred Bird F.C.S., Experimental 
Chemist...'it was not the pursuit of scientific knowledge which prompted him to devise a new custard based on cornflour rather
than eggs, but rather his concern to find a compromise betwen his wife's partiality to custard and her allergy to eggs.'...
Demand for Bird's prdouct increased steadily during the second half of the 19th century. Competitors, using formulae whose ingredients
included arrowroot, sago flour, or potato starch,  coloured with tumeric or chrome yellow, and flavoured with cassia or
bittered almonds, also entered the market. Bird's, however, promoted their product with skilful salesmanship, and became so
closely identified with custard powder that few competitors survived. The principal factor in the success of custard powder was
that, as it did not contain eggs, there was no longer any risk of the sauce curdling in unskilled hands."<br>

"Starch for all kinds of purposes had been leached from wheat and rice by the simplest water solution from the time of ancient
Egypt and China. In the sixteenth century, American colonists imported wheat starch in some quantity to powder their wigs and
starch their collars, until they developed wheat- and later potato-starch factories of their own. Not until the nineteenth 
century was there any major change in starch extraction, when in 1840 the Englishman Orlando Jones patented a method which used
an alkaline as catalyst. Within four years, Colgate & Company had applied the patent to corn in its wheat-starch factory in
Jersey City. An employee, Thomas Kingsford, was so struck by the results that he set up a cornstarch factory of his own in 
Oswego New York. This extracted cornstarch was first sold culinarily as a flour, superior to finely ground wheat flour for the
baking of cakes. The fact that starch did not have the same properties as flour presented problems for the manufacturer in
promoting his product. A recipe pamphlet of 1877 explained to the housewife why some of the recipes called for a little wheat
flour to be added to the cornstarch: "This is done because the Oswego Corn Starch is so rich in all its parts, that
it will not hold together in cakes, biscuits, etc., without the aid of flour..."...Wright Duryea, who had worked as a 
millwright, opened his own starch factory in 1854, coining the word Maizena for his starch. By 1892 he had the largest
starch factory in the country, grinding up several thousand bushels of corn a day."<br>

"Starch.--This substance forms a large part of our cereals and vegetables--wheat, rice, corn, peas and beans, sago, horse-chest-nuts
and potatoes. In the starch of commerce there are only two known descriptions--those used for food and those employed for 
manufacturing and laundry purposes. The starch in our markets is largely manufactured from the potato. The <i>Corn-starch</i>, which 
enters so largely into the food for invalids and infants, and various products of confectionery and the domestic panty, is prepared
from Indian corn--two large factories alone furnishing more thatn 40,000,000 pounds of starch annually, and consuming in its
production upwards of 2,000,000 bushels of corn. Its manufacture, as now conducted by the <i>new chemical process</i>, is so
superior in quality and flavor as not only to have superseded and dreinven out the foreign brands, which formerly found a ready
sale in the United States, but it has created for itself a large export demand to Europe and other parts of the world, which is
rapidly and constantly increasing. The new process of which we speak, entirely obviates the process of <i>souring</i> the
grain, formerly resorted to, the gluten being separated from the corn by the action of acids and alkalies. The food-starches, of which
maize, the sago-palm and manioc forms the basis, are the arrow-root and corn-starch, and consequently far less acid than the laundry
and manufacturing article, which is made from rice, wheat and potatoes."<br>

<b>[1911] Grocers's Encyclopedia</b><br>
"Corn starch, used in the manufacture of puddings, etc., is made from the raw starch of corn by breaking it up, washing and siphoning repeatedly, running
over refining sieves of fine silk which remove any particles of fibre still adhering, putting through various refiningh processes, drying until the content
of water has been reduced to only about 10% and finally pulverizing."<br>

<b>What was a "Paper of cornstarch?"</b><br>
Miss Leslie tells us to use a "half-pound" paper of cornstarch to make blancmange c. 1851. 
What was "a paper of cornstarch" and how big (volume) was it in 19th century USA?
Miss Leslie and her contemporaries assume her readers are familiar with this product. Competing commercial starches (sago, custard
powder) were sold in air-tight tins and measured by spoons/cups or weight. Miss Leslie's description leads us to believe the 
"paper" might have referred to the finished product, not a container. We also find "paper of isinglass" and
"sheets of gelatine." Curiously? The phrase "paper of cornstarch" is generally published in cook books containing other cornstarch
recipes employing standard kitchen measures (cups, teaspoons, etc.). 
<p>
Miss Leslie's reference here:<br>
"Corn-Starch Blancmange. 
Buy at one of the best grocer's a half-pound paper of corn-starch flour..." <br>
---<i>Miss Leslie's Complete Cookery</i>, 1851, accessed online via <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3tlr5qo"> 
GoogleBooks</a>.

<p>
The argument for "paper" as a food container container cannot be summarily dismissed. Civil-war era diaries often mention "papers" of food items. "Curtis Burke's
Civil War Journal," edited by Pamela J. Bennett, contributed by Richard A. Misselhorn, <i>Indiana Magazine of History</i>,
December 1970, mentions "paper of corn starch," "paper of dried cherries," (p. 344), "paper of ten [tea?]," "paper of white
sugar," and "paper of prunes." (p. 343). 
<p>

<p>
One of our readers (Aryn Long) deduced: "From the above bit of information, we learn that a paper of
cornstarch was a half-pound. The conversion factor that we need to know is how much cornstarch weighs and we know from doing
a little research that a half a pound of cornstarch is 1 1/2 cups cornstarch (.05 lb= 1.5 cups). I guess that means that a paper
of cornstarch was 1.5 cups of cornstarch." This assumes cornstarch has a constant weight through time. Leslie's description
also leaves room that there might have been different sizes of "paper."

Because cooking depends upon chemistry and ratios, comparing proportions in similar recipes may also provide clues:

Corn starch makes an excellent pudding. Boil the milk in a pan, over a kettle of boiling water. For each quart of milk take six
tablespoons full of starch, rubbed smooth in a little milk and three well beaten eggs. Pour them into the boiling milk, adding a little
salt, and stir constantly for three minutes, and then turn it out for the table, or mould it in teacups, to be eaten cold. 
Sweetened cream with nutmeg is the best sauce."<br>

"During the 1870s the German immigrants Frederick and Louis Rueckheim sold popcorn on the streets of
Chicago. They began to experiment with combining popcorn with several other products. When the Columbian
Exposition opened in Chicago in 1893, they sold a confection composed of popcorn, molasses, and peanuts,
which they prepared in a small factory. After the exposition, orders for the confection rose. The Rueckheims
increased production, repackaged the product so that it would stay fresh, named it Cracker Jack, and
promoted it nationwide. Conflicting stories as to how "Cracker Jack" acquired its name have surfaced. The
most commonly told story goes as follows. While sampling and tasting the new confection, John Berg, a
company salesman, purportedly exclaimed: "That's crackerjack." Frederick Rueckehim looked at him and
said, "Why not call it by that name?" Berg responded, "I see no objection," Rueckehim's decisive reply was
"That settles it then." The story is probably apocryphal as, at that time, the term "cracker jack" was commonly
used slang that meant "first-rate" or "excellent." Cracker Jack was soon sold in snack bars at circuses, fairs,
and sporting events. In 1908, the lyricist Jack Norworth and the composer Albert von Tilzer immortalized
Cracker Jack in their song, "Take Me Out to the Ball Game"...Unlike other fad foods, Cracker Jack survived.
Throughout the early twentieth century the company expanded, opening operations in Canada and the United
Kingdom. By 1913 Cracker Jack was the world's largest-selling commercial confection. A major reason for
its longevity was extensive national advertising, specifically focused at children. In 1912 a small toy was
included in every package. The little sailor boy and his dog were first used in advertisements in 1916, and
three years later they appeared on the Cracker Jack box...In 1970 Cracker Jack was enjoyed in 24,689,000
homes, or 41 percent of all American households. Then other companies began manufacturing Cracker Jack-like snacks, and 
Cracker Jack sales declined."<br>

  <a href="foodfaq2.html#onions">Onions</a> played an important role in European cuisine from very ancient days forward. Easily transported, readily raised, 
historically appreciated, and perfectly paired. Onions are equally comfortable playing star or supporting roles.  
  <p>
  <b>How were early American onions prepared?</b><br> 
  New England's colonial cooks prepared onions in several different ways, using recipes
  they brought from home. Culinary evidence confirms onions were: boiled & served with
  butter, salt, and pepper, fried, stewed, pickled, featured in pies, soups and "made" dishes,
  and served as "sauce."  Onion sauce contained cream and, according to early recipes, was
  served as both side dish or poured over fowl. Early 19th century recipes sometimes add
  milk and flour to whole onions, the primary components of a the standard white sauce
  used for contemporary creamed onions. Recipes specifically titled "creamed onions"
  appear in American cook books at the tail end of the 19th century. They proliferate in the 20th century.

  <b>[1595] "To Boil Onions.</b><br>
  "Take a good many onions and cut them in four quarters. Set them on the fore in as much
  water as you think will boil them tender. When they be clean skimmed, put in a good
  many small raisins, half a spoonful of gross pepper, a good piece of sugar, and a little salt.
  When the onions be thoroughly boiled, beat the yolk of an egg with verjuice, and put into
  your pot. So serve it upon sops. If you will, poach eggs and lay upon them."<br>
  ---<i>The Good Housewife's Jewell</i>, Thomas Dawson, reprint 1595 edition, introduction by
  Maggie Black [Southover Press:East Sussex] 1996 (p. 32)<br>
  [NOTES: verjuice is the tart juice of grapes; sops are thick, dried pieces of bread. As is
  characteristic of Renaissance-era recipes, this one features sugar and Medieval
  spices/ingredients.]
  <p>
  <b>[1621]</b><r> According to the food notes supplied by Edward Winslow of Plimoth, onions
  were available in the fall of that year. While he does not specifically state onions were
  served, or supply recipes,  it is reasonable to assume onions graced the table in some
  form. These notes regarding the first Thanksgiving dinner from Plimoth Plantation state
  our menu traditions for this meal were created in the 19th century. Coincidentally? So
  were recipes for creamed onions.
