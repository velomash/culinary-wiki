<b>What is shortening?</b><br>
Shortening is fat used for cooking. It can be made from animal, vegetable or compound manufactured substances. 
Margarine and Crisco are examples of manufactured shortening products. 
<p>
<a name="shorteningfunction">
<b>What is the function of shortening?</b><br> 
"Shorteners make baked goods tender and moist. This occurs when the shortener (butter, oil,
hydrogenated shortening, or lard) is incorporated into the batter. The fat tends to surround the
flour and the other ingredients, breaking the long strands of gluten in the batter or dough into
shorter units--hence the term "shorteners." The way in which the fat is incorporated will affect
the item's overall texture. Fats that are rubbed or rolled into doughs tend to separate the dough
into large layers, creating a flaky texture. When the fat is thoroughly creamed together with sugar
so that it can be mixed evenly throughout the batter, the resulting item's texture will be more
cake-like and tender. Fat also helps to retain moisture in the finished product. In addition to the
fats and oils commonly considered shorteners, egg yolks, soft cheeses, cream, and milk may also
fall into this category because they contain a relatively high percentage of fat."<br>

Reinhold:New York] 1996 (p. 376)
<p>
<a name="shorteningname">
<b>Why call it shortening?</b><br>
According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, "Short" (definition 20) denotes "Of edible substances: Friable, easily 
crumbled." The word first surfaces in the first half of the 18th century. The word shortening, in the current understanding,
is American. Amelia Simmons [<i>American Cookery</i> 1796] mentions (without defining) shortening in her recipe for 
<a href="http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/books/americancookery/amer.pdf">Johnny Cake, or Hoe Cake</a> 
"Scald 1 pint of milk and put to 3 pints of indian meal, and half pint of flower--bake before the fire. Or scald with milk two thirds of the indian meal, or wet two
 thirds with boiling water, add salt, molasses and shortening, work up with cold water pretty stiff, and bake as above."

<p>
<a name="shortenings">
<b>Purpose, classifications & effects of specific shortenings used to make baked goods</b><br>
<b>"Shortenings.<br>
I. Definition and Description</b><br>
Shortening refers to edible fats or vegetable or animal origin used in baked goods primarily to improve the eating qualities of the
finished product thorugh making it tender and 'short'. There is a variety of shortenings available. These differ mainly in their origin,
flavor, and consistency. With the exception of butter, lard and margarine, practically all shortenings preferable for bakery products are
practically neutral in flavor. Fats which are liquid at ordinary room temperatures are usually termed oils. The types of shortenings generally used
in cake making are solid at room temperature. Some, however, possess a higher melting point and are harder than others. The modern manufacturer of
shortening aims to produce a shortening of the desired plasticity or degree of hardness best suited to the needs of the 
average cake baker.
<p>
<b>II. Classification of Shortenings</b><br>
Shortenings may be conveniently and briefly classified in three groups: Animal, vegetable, and compound shortenings.<br>
<b>A. Animal Shortenings</b><br>
As the name implies, animal shortenings are of animal origin. Although little used in cake making, one of the best known shortenings in this
group is lard which is produced from selected fat of the hog through a process known as 'rendering'. Butter, of course, needs no
introduciton. It is the fat of milk, separated from milk or cream by churning and contains also a small amount of other milk
constituents.<br>
<b>B. Vegetable Shortenings</b><br>
Among the shortenings of vegetable origin we have the well known hydrogentated fats, which ar solid and semi-solid shortenings produced by
the proper treating of certain vegetable oil with hydrogen. Through this process, a fat of practically any desired degree of hardiness may
be secured. A high degree of perfection has been reached in the manufacture of hydrogenated shortenings which are very popular
for cake work, and which possess excellent qualities.<br>
<b>C. Compound Shortenings</b><br>
Compounds, as the name signifies, represent that group of shortenings made by compounding of blending a vegetable oil with a hard fat
in proper proportions so as to give a resulting product of desirable consistency similar to that of lard. Margarine, 
sometimes called 'artificial butter', is a mixture of fats, usually refined oleo oil churned in with some butter, neutral lard, and 
milk. Sometimes, vegetable oils, such as cottonseed oil, are also used. Cocoanut oil is often used in the preparation of various
 kinds of so-called 'nut butter' or 'nut margarine'.
<p>
<b>III. Functions of Shortening in Cake Making<br>
A. Improved Eating Qualities</b><br>
Shortening, being a form of fat, does not dissolve in the liquid of the cake batter. It is merely mixed mechanically in with the
other ingredients and is spread out uniformly in the form of fine films surrounding the other ingredients of the batter or dispersed through the cake
mixture when present in a limited quantity. When the cake is baked and cooled, this results in the creation of that tender, soft
characteristic of the crumb which is so desirable in most kinds of cake and which is commonly termed shortness. Naturally, shortening imparts
'richness' to the eating quality of the cake.<br>
<b>B. Production Of Volume</b><br>
With exception of Angel Food and some types of Sponge Cake in which no shortening is used, the judicious use of shortening in most other
types of cake aids materially in the creation of the desired volume, grain, and texture. This action of shortening has been
explained previously under the subject of 'Leafening by Creaming.'<br>
<b>C. Enhanced Freshness</b><br>
The shortening which is uniformly distributed throughout the mix mass of cake ingredients coats each tiny particle, thus imparting to the curmb
of the finished product a long lasting softness. This means that the cake will retain its characteristic of freshness for a longer
period.
<p>
<b>IV. Important Characteristics of Shortening<br>
A. Color</b><br>
For white cakes, the absence of color in the shortening employed is considered desirable, so that the color of crumb of the finished cake will
not be adversely influenced.<br>
<b>B. Flavor</b><br>
With the exception of butter or margarine, the shortening used in cake making should possess either a neutral or extremely mild flavor
that it will not mask or interfere with the natural flavor of the cake created by the blending of the other ingredients, including
any definite flavoring which may be used in the mix. <br>
<b>C. Keeping Qualities</b><brf>
Light, warmth, air, and moisture favor the development of rancidity in fats and oils. Furthermore, fats in general have a tendency to absorb
odors and flavors during storage. Therefore, shortenings in storage should be kept tightly covered in a cool, dark, dry, place
free from all odors. However, some of the well-known high grade types of hydrogenated vegetable shortenings available today posess remarkably
 good keeping qualities. Especial care should be taken regarding the storage of butter in order to prevent the development of 
off-flavors. The ability of any shortening to retain its freshness and sweetness is of utmost importance in the manufacture of 
quality baked goods, for it any fat becomes slightly rancid and is used, it will impart to the finished product a disagreeable taste and
odor which is even more objectionable to the consumer than ordinary staleness. Today, the baker is fortunate in being able to secure solid
shortenings which are quite resistant to the development of rancidity provided they are stored properly.<br>
<b>D. Creaming Power and Stability</b><br>
Shortening used in cake making should be of such consistency and character that it will cream up well with sugar and eggs, forming with
them a smooth, light mass of good volume that will maintain its structure during the addition of the other cake ingredients without
breaking down or curdling. The shortening used should not be lumpy or unduly hard.<br>
<b>E. Shortening Power and Uniformity</b><br>
The ability of a shortening to impart that desirable eating or chewing quality known as shortness is naturally of importance in 
connection with it use in cake making. Uniformity is also an essential factor. Uniformity in all ingredients and uniformity in the
manner of handling these ingredients mean uniformity in the finished product."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>butter</b></font><br>
Food historians tell us butter was "discovered" by nomadic peoples of central Asia. It was
  adopted in the northern parts of Europe where rich, green pastures were plentiful and milk
  cows proliferated.
  <p>
  "Butter probably originated amongst the nomadic peoples of central Asia--quite plausibly
  first discovered by accident after a hard day in the saddle during which the rider's neglected
  container of milk had been constantly churned. Iti s used gradually spread to India and
  Europe, although Greece and Rome, both olive-oil cultures, it was at first treated with both
  suspicion and derision as an inferior foreign product...There are two main strands in the
  history of butter. In the Indian subcontinent it is preserved by melting it and straining off the
  impurities (see Ghee)...The European tradition, on the other hand, has been to preserve it
  with salt."<br>
  ---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 48)
  <p>
  "Mac Block suggests:  It may be that in the final reckoning we owe butter to the nomadic
  peoples of the Europe-Asiatic plains.' He mentions the Mongolian technique of churning
  cream horizontally in a leather flask suspended above the ground, after it has been skimmed
  off with milk. This is the most archaic way of butter-making, still practised by the people of
  the Atlas. By the time invaders from Asia settled a Sumer around 3500BC, they were shaking
  cream in a vertically designed churn...The Celts and then the Vikings passed on a taste for
  butter to their descendants; they may have derived that taste partly from their origins, but also
  from the fact that cattle did so well in their various adoptive countries, always chosen for
  green pastures...The ancient Greeks and Romans did not use butter much in their
  cooking...Butter was not really used much in Italy until the fifteenth cnetury; in France, it
  features in a third of the recipes of the sixteenth century [cookbook] Livre fort excellent. The
  use of butter for thickening sauces, in the classic manner, was slow to infiltrate the kitchen.
  The influence of the example set by the Vikings and Normans when butter consumption
  began is obvious; in those parts of Western Europe which they later colonized...Not until the
  fourteenth century did the Church have anything to say about butter in its directives for
  fasting."<br>

  "In myths of ancient cultures, butter symbolized fertility as well as purity...Myths of Hindu
  India attest to the purity of butter, particularly of clarified butter of ghee, a golden liquid
  produced by melting the butter and then removing from it the whey products that rise to the
  top and the salt that sinks to the bottom. To the Hindus, ghee is a sacred substance, a product
  of the sacred cow; in myth, ghee arose at the beginning of the world, as the gods and demons
  churned the ocean of milk. During the Deluge, soma..the elixir of life, had gotten submerged
  in this ocean, and the gods had to retrieve it to regain their strength. They used the snake
  deity Vasuki as a rope and Mount Mandata as a churning pole to churn the ocean until high
  gods and sacred objects arose from its depths, solidifying like butter from milk. Soma, the
  elixir of life, finally emerged...Hindu rituals today often involve the use of both fire and ghee
  as purifiers. Worshippers anout images of gods such as Vishnu and Krishna with ghee; they
  also wash them with milk, or with a mixture of milk, curd, butter, honey, and sugar. The
  effectiveness of this purification stems from the belief in cows themselves as
  purifiers...Indian cooks today frequently incorporate butter, or ghee, into recipes. It has
  become a cooking staple, and some pious Hindus continue to believe in its sanctity...The
  ancient people of Iceland also linked fire with butter: Farmers' wives traditionally appealed
  to Gobhin, the smith god, to watch over their butter...The Masai, a pastoral people of East
  Africa, consider butter an agent of belssing and use it as an ointment in all life-cycle rituals.
  The Masai consider milk the ultimate food and consider butter refined milk; they say that it
  provides sustencence and ensures growth and fertility. Tibetian pastoralists, who rely on the
  yak, assign special significance to yak butter as well, and Tibetan lamas spend months every
  year carving statues of the deities form the butter...In Ireland, Saint Brigit took over the
  functions of the earlier Celtic goddess Brigit, a mother goddess and guardian of cows and
  ewes...The goddess...also appears to have had a magic store of butter, and fed the people
  from its inexaustible supply."<br>

  "The first creameries (butter factories) appeared in upstate New York in the late 1850s and
  early 1860s...The industrialization of butter production truly took off in the last decade of the
  nineteenth century, promoted by the invention of the mechanical cream separator. Earlier,
  the size of creameries had been constrained by the time needed to wait for the cream to rise
  to the top of the separating vats. The mechanical cream separator allowed cream to be
  separated out from whole milk in a matter of minutes rather than days, and creameries could
  start butter production with cream rather than whole milk. Factors production of butter rose
  from 29 million pounds in 1879 to 627 million in 1909 to over 1 billion in 1921. With this
  rise, dominant brands appeared. In the nineteenth century, butter was marketed mainly in
  tubs and portioned out by the grocer to individual buyers. In 1898, the first packaged butter
  was marketed by Beatrice Creamery Company."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Double butter</b></font><br>
What is double butter (doppio burro)? 
Interesting question. We find two explanations:<br>
1. Concentrated butter containing twice the normal amount of fat.<br>
2. Double the butter used for the *usual* recipe. 
<p>
"Q: What is double butter, which is used in the original recipe for fettuccine Alfredo? Where can
I buy it? - Pope Welch, Jackson, Ga. 
A: The original recipe for fettuccine Alfredo does call for three ingredients - unsalted butter,
grated Parmesan cheese and fettuccine. No cream sauce or other additions. From time to time,
I've seen that recipe and a reference to double butter. The American Dairy Association had no
information about double butter, and several Italian chefs in Atlanta hadn't worked with it either.
They said you've got to use the best unsalted butter you can find. At the restaurant level, that
might be Plugra butter, unsalted butter produced in Flushing, Ohio. It's a little richer than regular
butter. It has 82 percent fat, compared with 80 percent fat in regular butter. And it contains less
moisture - 16.5 percent, compared with 18.5 percent - so the flavor is more concentrated. But
unfortunately, Plugra isn't available at retail. Lynne Rosetto Kasper, a St. Paul, Minn., writer who
has lived in Italy and written about Italian food, said although she has never seen double butter
sold in Italy, that fettuccine recipe undoubtedly called for the most flavorful unsalted butter on
the market. And that would depend on the dairy. Your best gauge is taste."<br>

Journal and Constitution</i>, December 3, 1992, Section W (p. 3)
<p>
"FETTUCCINE AL BURRO is associated in every tourist's mind with Rome, possibly because the original
Alfredo succeeded in making its serving a spectacle reminiscent of grand opera. It is the same
ribbon shaped egg pasta that is called tagliatelle in Bologna; but the al burro preparation is very
Roman indeed in its rich simplicity. Nothing is added to the pasta except grated cheese and butter
- lots of butter. The recipe calls for doppio burro, double butter, which gives it a golden color."<br>

<a name="unsaltedbutter">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Unsalted butter</b></font><br>
Recipes specifying unsalted butter are often hoping to achieve a sweeter, finer product. In 
the old days (before refrigeration) butter was preserved with salt. Colonial and pioneer cooks 
actually "washed" their butter before using it. Then, as today, unsalted (fresh) butter was 
preferred for making the finest cakes and cookies. Pre-industrial unsalted (aka fresh, French) butter was more 
expensive than salted/preserved [long lasting] counterpart. In the late 1870s advances in food science made possibly commercial 
production of unsalted butter. The reaction among American consumers was overwhelmingly positive. Among those who could 
afford it. Coincidentally? This is 
when "artificial butter" (aka margarine, oleomargerine) was introduced and salt was associated with disguising poor quality 
product. 
<p>
"After churning, the butter is further worked, and also washed in plain water, to remove as 
much of the buttermilk as possible and improve the texture and flavour...This also improves 
keeping quality, as does the addition of salt, which discourages the growth of bacteria. 
Butter, whether salted or not, is not a fully preserved food; indeed, it begins to deteriorate 
(albeit slowly) at once." <br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food,</i>Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 
117) 
<p>
"Fresh or sweet butter, so often specified in our recipes, is butter that has been neither salted 
nor clarified butter keeps remarkably well (it is the milk solids that are so subject to turning 
rancid) and serves very well for frying, and is indeed then far easier to handle. For many 
purposes, salt butter was well washed before use to remove the salt. While it then never has 
quite the flavor and charm of fresh butter, it was surely in no worse condition than most of 
the butter we are able to buy today, which has little character to begin with and has sojourned 
in cold storage for months." <br>

Press:New York] 1995 (p. 9)

"The liking for butter that contains a very small percentage of salt is a taste that is rapidly growing in this country, and one which dairymen would 
do well to cater to. Of course, as butter of this description will not bear long keeping, it must of necessity command a higher price than that which 
can be held to meet the demands of the market. on this account its manufacture will ordinarily be restricted to dairies that are situation within a 
relatively short distance of certain great centers of consumption. In this City, the demand for this species of butter, due, doubtless, to our large 
German and French population, is very great, but as mentioned above, the liking for this article is rapidly growing among those with whom the 
taste is not an inherited one. Indeed, it only needs a short sojourn in an inland town or on a farm in this country to become aware of the strong 
liking that exists for butter of an exceedingly salt variety. There may be not the least difficulty in obtaining butter that is fresh as regards time, 
but the landlady of a village boarding-house, or the wife of a farmer, cannot understand the liking that her guests have for what to her is an 
exceedingly insipid article of food. Another circumstance that must always add to the cost of butter with which little or not salt has been worked, 
is the fact that a much greater degree of care is required in its making. Salt, when plentifully used, is a notorious disguiser of imperfections, while, 
on the other hand, impurities can be detected in strictly unsalted butter that are not apparent in milk. For this reason the utmost cleanliness in the 
manufacture is necessary, and though what is known as a naturally cold hand for touching butter is often spoken of as highly desirable, it is much 
better to have it made in such a manner that direct contact with the hand is unnecessary. A device, which seems to have originated in Holstein, 
has recently been introduced into on or two of the fancy dairies in the State of Massachusetts. This is a rapidly-rotating separator, build upon the 
principle of a centrifugal machine in a sugar refinery. The fresh milk is poured into this, and by its rapid revolutions the cream is in a minute or two 
separated from the thin milk; presses are then used which squeeze out all the lactic acid that is to be found in the buttermilk. By this process 
unsalted butter can be made which will, by careful keeping, retain its good quality for some little time. No doubt, as the demand increases, 
facilities for meeting it will be found and applied, as Americans are never backward in adapting means to ends; but under the most favorable 
conditions, butter of this kind will probably command a price fully 50 per cent higher than that demanded for the ordinary 
grades." <br>
---Editorial, <i>New York Times</i>, November 10, 1879 (p. 4) 
<p>
"A short time since we referred to the increased use of unsalted butter in this country, and as a sequel to what was then said, it may 
be well to call attention to the circumstance that a process has recently been invented in England by which butter of this kind can 
be kept certainly for months, and possibly for years, without apparent deterioration. An experiment made proved that fresh butter when 
treated with this preservative could remain exposed to the action of air for three months, and at the end of that time it was hardly 
possible to detect the difference between it and the newly-made article. Some experts at butter-tasting, it is said, through that it 
lacked something of the aroma which butter fresh from the dairy possesses, and that an exceedingly slight trace of salt 
in it would impart to it more character. But for all practical purposes the article, at the end of three months, was as good 
as at the beginning, although under ordinary conditions it would have been considered unfit for eating at the end of ten days. The 
'preparation,' as it is called, by the use of which this result is obtained is at present a secret. It is an odorless, tasteless, and 
harmless antiseptic, and has also the merit of exceeding cheapness; so much so that the quantity needed to preserve a pound of 
butter costs in England about half a penny. It is worked into the butter directly after churning, and then all that is required is 
that the manufactured article should be kept in a tolerably cool place. The change which this discovery promises to bring about can 
hardly fail to be an important one, as it will tend to equalized the cost of the best table butter through the entire year. Hitherto, in 
the Winter months, the price of even mildly salted butter has been high, for the reason that that made in the Summer for 
Winter consumption could only be kept pure by the admixture of a large quantity of salt. The same is true of what is known as 
cooking butter, which, as it is frequently made in a hurried and imperfect manner, is only checked from early putrefaction by the 
excessive use of saline preservative. Now, if salt is no longer necessary, butter may be good or poor, but in either case its 
merits or faults will not need to be disguised under a covering of salt. It is also intimated that the same preparation can be 
applied to the preserving of fresh meat,and if this proves to be true, its effect upon the trade and dietary customs of the world 
will bake the discover one of the most important of the century." <br>

"In contrast to the general taste, there has developed in the larger cities a considerable demand among the customers of high class stores for un-colored and 
un-salted butter--variously known as "Fresh," "Sweet" and "French." Some of the French stores of the metropolis and elsewhere have always handled this for their 
patrons, but the present sale to a large number of families of other nationalities and to many high class hotels and restaurants is of comparatively recent origin. 
The perfumed butter used in Paris is made by taking pats of "fresh" or unsalted butter and placing them on a layer of some variety of flowers, according to the 
perfume desired, a piece of muslin being laid between the butter and blossoms. Another layer of flowers is placed above 
the butter and then ice is added." <br>

<a name="lard">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Lard</b></font><br>
Lard is rendered pig fat. Food historians tell us pigs/hogs have been used by humans for food
and cooking since prehistoric times. Traditional slaughtering time was late fall. No parts,
including, extremities were wasted. The fat from the pig was employed from these very early
days forward as a cooking medium and ingredient. Uses and recipes evolved according to
culture and cuisine. How was lard discovered? Like most early foods, probably by accident. Presumably, when early cooks 
finished cooking hog pieces, they noticed the thick fat (aka lard) which congealed after
cooling. <a href="shortening.html#leaflard">Leaf lard</a> is considered by some to be the highest quality of hog fat.
<p>
"Originally, lard was bacon or fat pork, a meaning it still has in French; the sense  referred pig
fat' did not become firmly established until the eighteenth century (the French for  'lard' in this
sense is saindoux). The word comes ultimately from Latin lardum or laridum, which may be
connected with Greek larinos,  fat'. Its appearance as a verb, meaning  insert small strips of
fat bacon into meat before cooking', actually predates the noun in English, first occuring in
1330. The strips of bacon or other fat so used are called lardons or lardoon. This word (the
original French lardon is nowadays more frequently encountered in cookery books than the
anglicized lardoon) has been around since at least the mid-fifteenth century, but has never
perhaps become an everyday term...The highest grade of lard is made from the fat beneath the
pig's skin and under its ribs, and also from the mesentery, part of the intestinal wall. These are
cooked over a very slow heat to produce lard. Lard used to be kept in a pig's bladder...The
word larder is a derivative of lard. A larder was probably originally a room in which bacon
was stored. In previous centuries it was also called a lard house and a lardy."<br>

"Lard is pig fat, obtained by rendering down the deposits which exist between the flesh and
the skin and around the internal organs of pig carcasses. It is bland and white, and its ubiquity
in an age when pigs were kept by all those who could afford them made it very important in
the traditional cookery of Europe, the Americas, and China. The fat of the pig was an article
of almost as much value as the meat. Lard contains much saturated fat, and this, combined
with an image as poverty food and the increasesd availability of butter and oils, means that it
is less important than formerly in the developed world...In keeping with the tradition of not
wasting any part of the pig, the bits of membrane left in the pan, cooked by the action of heat
on the fat, are used as salty snacks or eaten on bread...(cracklings)...Lard has many uses,
especially in areas where plant oils and dairy fats are scarce...The use of lard as a preservative
is best illustrated by the confits of pork or goose made in SW France...Like all fats, lard is
composed of crystals. These are relatively large...and make it a poor creaming fat but an
effective shortener for pastry. Thus there are few cakes which use lard, but many pastries...The
use of lard for frying has been in decline in western countries, eroded by vegetable oils with
their healthier image..."<br>

"When Europeans set up their stockades in North America, they brought with them pigs and
cows, the four-legged factories that would produce virtually all of the cooking fat used in this
country until the industrial revolution. Lard, rendered pork fat, was by far the most common
shortening throughout the colonial era and well into the antebellum period. Lard was used for
frying, breads, biscuits, cakes, and even as a dressing for vegetables. Before the advent of
refrigeration, most of the nation's pork was salted, and the fattier parts were used for flavoring
stuffings as well as stews. Bacon and the dripping that it would yield were prized ingredients.
In this agrarian society lard was rendered at home and kept for many months in the cool
confines of the aptly named larder. The crisp crust that lard produces in frying was particularly
appreciated in the South, where, it has been suggested, black cooks adapted West African
frying techniques to create regional specialties such as fried chicken and hush puppies.
Certainly pork fat was much more available below the Mason-Dixon Line than in New
England, where dairy and beef cattle were the more common forms of livestock. For many
recipes, lard continues to retain favor in parts of the old Confederacy...Early recipes often
called for butter or lard...Whether the cook used butter or lard was generally an issue of price
and availability."<br>

"Lard is hog's fat separated form the tissue by boiling or rendering. The residye is known as lard stearin. Lard is put up in kegs, barrels, 
tierces and small cans. Its quality vaires very much with different houses. If pure, it should be white, of the consistence of 
ointment and free from an disagreeable taste or smell. Leaf lard is that made from the leaf fat which lies around the kidneys. The
bext best in quality is that from the back, and the poorest that from the small intestines. The greater part of that marketed is obtained by
the melting together of the whole fat, except the leaf fat. Compound lard is generally a mixture of lard stearin and cottonseed oil. The
most common fraud in the sale of lard is the substitution of 'compound' for pure lard. New tierces will soak from two to three
pounds when filled with hot lard, but if they weight over that amount claim should be made on them. The most honest of packers are
liable to have trouble with tares. Lard should be stored in a dry, cool dark place--moisture, light and high temperature affect its
quality."<br>

True leaf lard surrounds the kidneys of the hog. Commerical leaf lard surfaced in the l880s. This lard has the reputation for being the
 finest grade. Like other shortenings, leaf lard was used for frying and shortening ingredient. It's "flavorless" quality made it especially appealing because, like 
competing vegetable shortening Crisco, it did not change the flavor of the finished dish. Historic descriptions concerning health and cleanliness
help us understand why "modern" homemakers favored commercial products over "natural" ingredients.

"If you want the finest of all seasonings for winter cornbreads, get pork cracklings. If you want to make chop suey now and 
then, have some home-tried-out lard for frying of the ingredients. You need lard for pie crusts, and that home rendered is highly 
excellent for the purpose if it is as white as snow, as it may be by the following method: Three-fourths lard to one-fourth butter makes 
excellent shortening for cookies. Buy a cone of leaf lard from a totally reliable butcher and scrape and wipe off any dirt on the outer part of it. After this preliminary 
cleaning, remove the parchment-like skin and cut out any blood spots, if any are discoverable. Unless the leaf is exceptionally hard the 
fat can not be put through the food chopper, as suet can be in preparing it for the rendering pot. Cut it into small pieces with a 
knife or pull it apart as it is removed fro the parchment skin. Put into top of double boiler and cook until fat is melted out of the 
crackling part, which may not be stiff, but can be cooked over the fire with constant attention until they become so. ith this sort of 
cooking there is but the slightest odor given off, and the lard will not have a brown shade, although the cracklings, when finally 
finished, may have. The lard strained through a double cheese cloth is an attractive product. One part may be cooked plain, another with 
the seasonings of a soup bunch, to make it excellent for heating up dishes, and another with a little milk to make it a better or 
more tasteless shortening." <br>

"'Simon Pure' Leaf Lard. The qualities that make 'Simon Pure' Leaf Lard the first medium for deep frying and for shortening have been most 
carefully verified in the laboratories and kitchens of chemist and food experts. 'Simon Pure' Leaf Lard is a 100% pure leaf lard. It is 
made from that section of creamy-white leaf fat or which there is but a small portion in each of the corn-fed Government Inspected 
porkers. It is dry, crisp, flaky, delicate in flavor, and rich in every way. 'Simon Pure' Leaf Lard is rendered in open kettles. 
It is a slow method, but prevents scorching or undercooking, allows all moisture to escape, and brings you leaf lard at its best. The 
leaf shaped flakes of fat are chopped into small pieces for rendering, thus each particle receives even heat; then it is 'tried out' 
in steam jacketed open kettles, so that the steam escapes instead of condensing. This makes a drier lard and intensifies the delicate 
flavor. The result is a pure leaf lard, rich and creamy. Its creamy texture mixes readily with other ingredients in making pastries or cakes."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Margarine</b></font><br>
Aka "artificial butter," "margarine butter," "oleomargarine," "oilymargarine," and "butterine," this manufactured compound was 
introduced by the French in 1871 as an alternative for lower grades of butter. Primary sources suggest the product was not readily embraced by the American butter/dairy market. 
Cheaper and more stable, margarine was perceived as a threat to their lucrative industry. Laws were passed to protect the 
consumers from thinking margarine was real butter.
<p>
<b>[1879]</b><br>
"The second international dairy fair was opened in the American Institute building, December 8, with a fine display of dairy prdoucts, cattle and machinery. The
exhibits included butter, cheese, dairy cattle, implements and machinery for butter and cheese making, and agricultural designs
 and models for creameries, cheese factories, dairy buildings and farms...Butter makers in other dairy countries have, however, 
made great progress in improving their product, and the average quality is much better than it was five, or even three years ago...
Margarine butter, or oleomargarine as it is called here, has also assisted in bringing about this result, as it competed cussessfully with the 
poorer grades of ordinary butter, and obliged European butter makers to make an effort to produce a superior article."<br>
---"The International Dairy Fair," <i>Scientific American</i>, December 27, 1879

"Oleomargarine was discovered by the French chemist Mege. it was bitterly opposed in this country, especially by the
American Grocer and its owners in New York, but it has so completely overcome popular prejudice that the Thurbers are now
extensive owners in the manfactories of what they once abused so roundly. Laws have been passed obliging those who sell it to brand
all packages plainly as olemargarine, but this has only served to show the public that it is so near an approach to butter as to need
 a distinguishing mark. It is made of clean, fresh fat, because it would be almost impossible and very expensive to make a creditable
article out of fats which have the least taint. The Thurber establishment in New York city is said to turn out more oleomargarine than
the whole State of New York does butter. Many factories now exist in all parts of the Union."<br>
---<i>The Grocers' Hand-Book and Directory for 1886</i> [The Philadelphia Grocer Publishing Co.:Philadelphia] 1882, 1886 (p. 142-143)<br>

"Oleomargarine, also called Margarine and Butterine: was invented by the French chemist, Mege Mouriez in 1871. As manufactured to-day, it is
generally composed of 40% to 45% beef or Oleo oii; 20% to 25% Neutral lard (from the first rendering of the leaf fat of the hog) and
10% to 30% butter, milk or cream. Vegetable oils, such as cotton-seed oil, are sometimes added. The mixture is churnted at a
room temperature above the melting point, and then chilled and salted, worked, etc., in about the same way as butter. At the solicitation of those interested
in the prdouction and sale of butter, Congress passed a law, effective July 1, 1902, placing a tax of one-quarter of a cent of a pound on uncolored
Oleomargarine, and a tax of ten cents a pound on the colored product. In a great many states, manufactuers are, under severe
penalties, entirely forbidden the use of coloring matter. The law also requires that all Oleomargarine shall be plainly labeled, that it
shall not be sold in substitution for butter, and that when used in hotels, boarding houses, etc., the fact must be made known by 
announcments to that effect posted where they may be readily seen. The manufactuers of Oleomargarine claim that their product is 
equal to the finest dairy butter in purity and nutritiveness and that in flavor it is far superior to the cheaper grades of butter. These
claims are supported by many chemists and scientists."<br>
