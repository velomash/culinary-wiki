<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Shelf life dating (USA)</b></a></font><br>
In the United States, food dates are NOT required by federal law, with the exception of baby
food. A survey of newspaper/magazine articles reveals concerns about product dating (shelf-life, open dating, sell-by, best-if-used-by, use before, freshness dating, 
pack date, expiration date, quality assurance date, pull date, calendar date)  
in America began in the 1950s. State, industry, and manufacturer's dating practices varied according to location and product. In the 1970s the
"Consumers Right to Know Act" touched on product dating. In the late 1980s the media
gain raised consumer awareness and, by association, confusion, over the plethora of extant dating systems. In sum: shelf-life dates were added to
different foods at different times and mean different things in different industries. Today? They are as confusing as they were 40 years ago.

<p>
<b>[1971]</b><br>
"In 1971, at the age of 65, Mrs. [Esther] Peterson started another career, this time in business as vice president for consumer affairs at Giant Food Inc., the largest supermarket chain in the Washington-Baltimore area.

Odonna Mathews, who worked with Mrs. Peterson as a University of Maryland undergraduate intern and now holds Mrs. Peterson's old position at Giant, said: ''Her friends in consumer activism asked, 'How can you work for a business and represent the consumer?' She showed it could be done.''

At Giant, Ms. Mathews said, she worked with Mrs. Peterson on the grade labeling of food. ''She found it confusing,'' Ms. Mathews said. ''She asked, 'What's the difference between U.S. Fancy No. 1 and Extra Fancy?' ''

Ms. Mathews said Mrs. Peterson persuaded the supermarket to disclose what seafood had been previously frozen, a widespread practice now but one not in use before then.

''She got Giant to try nutritional labeling on its private products before it was required by Federal law, comparing calories and proteins,'' Ms. Mathews said. ''She got Giant to use open dating -- putting a date by which products like yogurt or milk must be sold.''

Before then, the stores used letter and number combinations to express the dates, a code that was not clear to buyers."<br>

"A bill requiring open dating has 'better prospects' than in the two previous legislative sessions when he introduced similar bills, according to State Sen. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles),
and the bill is winning support from a new group--consumers...In previous years his open dating bills were killed in the Agricultural Committee...Mrs. Shirley Doldinger, president of
the Assn. of California Consumers for Los Angeles and Orange Counties, said her association is supporting the bill. But in her opinion, voluntary open dating by the food industry is 
preferable. 'I can't see why industry will advertise that their products are fresh and high quality without going the full route and giving the shopper the complete information
on the label...If industry denies the consumer this information the consumer becomes suspicious.'...Following a shopping tour of five markets to check date information,
Mrs. Goldinger found some reason to distrust dating practices. First, she found several packages long past the date still in market refrigerators. ...'Of course we don't know for for sure if these are 
pull dates or pack dates."...The California Rural Legal Assistance lawyers filed a suit in San Francisco last December asking for a court order to require certain 
dairy companies to open date their produtcs...'Open dating has been the practice in Scandinavia for years without much trouble...We've talked with Richard Ralphs after Ralphs
markets began to open date their products, and he said they had no problem, that buyers just had to be more careful about ordering milk. Valley Gold (a dairy company)
has been calendar dating since 1956."<br>
---"Consumer Backing Seen for Dairy Products Dating Bill," Jeanne Voltz, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, March 4, 1971 (p. H6)
<p>
<b>[1979]</b><br>
"If the only milk left on the supermarket shelf has today's date on it, then does that mean the milk will spoil by tomorrow? And why does the dates on dry cereal follwo the
phrase, 'best if used by' but there is no such phrase, only a date, on cottage cheese? Well simply becasue dates on different food products mean different things. The 
'Jan. 20, 1979' stamped on a carton of milk does not indicate the same thing as thtaa date on a package of yeast or a box of cereal. But in each case, the aim of the 
open-dating is to reveal the freshness of the product. Who determines the date? Not the federal government, as many shoppers assume, but usually the manufacturer, retailer, or 
an association of producers for a specific product. Open-dating is voluntary under federal law, and only meat, poultry, and milk come under any type of ruling. There area
four types of open-dating in common use: the pull date, quality assurance date, pack date, and expiration date. Having all these dates seems to have only added to consuers'
confusion since the open-dating system began. In fact, the recent food labeling hearings by the federal Food and Drug dwelled on open-dating to a deree. As one FDA
spokesman said, 'the dates mean so many different things, they end up not meaning a thing.'...Pull date--this indicates the last recommended day for sale in a retail outlet. This date
is set by the manufacturer or retailer to allow for sufficient home storage or use. This date is most often found on dairy products (milk, cottage cheese...and fresh meat)...
Deli foods such as lunchmeats and sausage may also come with dating...'Fresh products such as pork sausage hae a 'sell by' date. After that the retailer must remove it from the 
shelf.' Quality assurance daate--Sometimes called 'best if used by' date. This indicates the last day at which that food item is considered at peak quality. Dry cereals, for
example, are labeled as such...Expiration date--Indicaataes the last date on which the product should be used for assured quality...Pack date--Indicates the day on which the food 
was processed or packaged. This simply is another indicataion of how fresh the merchandise is and can be found mostly on canned foods...As with all dates, they are merel 
freshness indicators. Following storage guidelines for individual food times is the best way to insure freshness."<br>
---"Because it's dated is it also fresh?" Judy Hevrdejs, <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, January 18, 1979 (p. C4)
<p>
"While the simple shelf-life dating of food may increase consumer confidence in the quality of the product, it may have little bearing on the food's safety. This conclusion was
one of the major findings of the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment in a report made public yesterday following an investigation into shelf-life dating. The
investigation sought to test the widespread belief that replacing the food industry's present system of largely indecipherable coded dates with clearly understandable 
open dates on food packages would help increase consumer confidence in food freshness, and encourage better handling of food products by retailers. 'There is little
evidence to support or to negate the contention that there is a direct relationship between open shelf-life dating and the actual freshness of food products when they
are sold,'...Open shelf-life dating involves putting dates on food packages to tell retailers and consumers when the contents should best be sold or eaten to insure
freshness, The dates may say when the product was packaged, when it should be sold and the date that it should be discarded if uneaten. Some form of open dating, generally 
involving dairy products, now is in effect in 21 states and the District of Columbia. Some food processors also have put open dates on selected food products, including numerical
or color codes to aid in inventory control. But the report said there was considerable confusion because of the lack of a uniform dating system. The present systems vary
widely as to the foods to be dated, the dates to be used and their meaning...The report which was preapared at the request of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and 
Transportation, said 'There are no nationwide statistics on the amount of food sold that is not fresh'...According to the report, New York is one of those states that have
no dating system at all. New Jersey requires the open dating of dairy productcs and Connecticut orders the open dating of milk. As to other overall findings, the report
found that: Pressure for open dating stems from public perceptions that this would insure food freshness, which may not be abolutely correct. Open dating fails to take into 
account the influence of such environmental factors as temperature, humidity and light and is unlikely to 'in the near furture.'...The costs of open dating are small and unclear 'but 
nonetheless may add from 1 to 1 cent to the costs of each packaged food.'"<br>
---"Report to Congress Doubts Value of Shelf-Life Dating," Richard D. Lyons, <i>New York Times</i>, August 29, 1979 (p. C8)
<p>
<b>[1981]</b><br>
"Although freshness dates are used by many shoppers when buying food, they actually tell
very little about a product's shelf life, says Lloyd Witter, food science professor at the
University of Illinois. Shelf life varies with the age and type of ingredients used, the process,
the package, the environmental conditions during distribution and storage as well as the
consumer's preference as to how fresh is "fresh." The food processor has control over those
conditions until the packages are shipped from the plant or warehouse. After that, the
responsibility shifts to the wholesaler, retailer and the consumer, Witter says. Many food
packages already indicate in code the date they were processed to help supermarket personnel
rotate stock and to identify defective merchandise in the event of a product recall. Witter says
the issue of food dating has been debated for 30 years. Consumers have urged that actual dates
be used to indicate a product's freshness. The types of dating systems that have been proposed
are the pack date, sell-by date or best-if-used by date. "It's nice to know how long a food
product will last but this is difficult to determine," Witter says. For this reason he thinks the
best dating system would be the "best-if-used-by" date. This indicates that the food is still
safe although possibly of lower quality after that time. According to Witter, the use-by date
incorrectly implies that the product is of high quality until that date regardless of any storage
problems and that it becomes unpalatable or dangerous after that date.The pack date tells
when food was packed and leaves it up to the consumer to decide how long after that date the
food is still of high quality. This is the coded date most often used for stock rotation. Many
states now require a sell-by date, also called the pull date, on certain foods. After this date, the
store manager must remove the package from his regular retail shelves and either dispose of it
or sell it at a reduced price in a segregated part of the store. Food dating can be misleading and
cause unnecessary problems in some cases, Witter says. Dating information depends on
whether the food is perishable, semi- perishable or shelf stable, Witter says. Milk, eggs and
fish are classified as perishable, and most states limit the length of time they may remain on
shelves or in coolers. Requirements vary among states, however, and the actual temperature in
a given cooler or the length of time the food is left outside the cooler will determine whether
the product actually retains its high quality for the stated time. Similar considerations also
apply to semiperishable foods such as cheese, cured meats, some pickled foods and snack
foods. Even shelf stable food, such as canned goods, dried foods and breakfast cereals, can
lose their quality if exposed to high temperatures and humidity, especially if their protective
packaging is damaged."<br>
---"Freshness Dates Don't Tell Much," <i>Boston Globe</i>, April 15, 1981 (p. 1)
<p>
<b>[1985]</b><br>
"Once upon a time, it was easy to get fresh bread. You could just walk to the local bakery and
choose a new-baked, fragrant loaf. Today, if you shop in a large market, you probably do a lot
more reading than sniffing to judge the freshness of bread--and many other foods as well.
Along with the ingredients list, nutrition labeling and other product information, you may find
any of six kinds of dates on food packages. Open dating, as this is called, got started in the
1970s as part of the consumers' "right to know" movement. Designed to inform shoppers of
product shelf life and to guide retailers in stock rotation, it can be confusing. Some state and
local statutes may require dating of perishable items such as eggs, milk and prepared
sandwiches, but this country has no federal regulations and no uniform dating system. The
hodgepodge of codes can befuddle any shopper. Open dating is not the only kind of
numbering system manufacturers may employ. It differs from code dating, a series of numbers
and/or letters used for inventory control. Nor is it the same as the Universal Product Code, the
small block of parallel lines and numbers found on practically all labels. Instead, open dating
is a specific date either printed, stamped or embossed on a product. Whether on the tops or
bottoms of cans, on bottle caps or on the side panels of boxes, open dating is there to help
shoppers select products at the store and keep tabs on them at home. The pack date--the day
the food was manufactured or processed--tells how old the food is when you buy it. It is
generally used on items with a long shelf life: canned goods, cake mixes and oils. Pack-date
information does not tell you how long a product is good or safe to eat, but it is helpful for
recalls. By contrast, the pull date or "sell by" date is the last day a retailer should sell a product
as fresh. Perishable foods--dairy products, meats, fish, bakery goods and cold cuts--may be
stamped with a pull date. It allows time for home storage, so that an item remains fine beyond
that date. How long it can be stored at home depends to some extent on the food in question.
Another category, the "best-if-used-by" date, may appear on cereals, aseptic packages of fruit
and vegetable juices, snack foods, peanut butter, salad dressings and cookies. Items consumed
after this date may represent no health risk, but manufacturers will no longer guarantee their
quality. Occasionally, perishable goods like soft cheeses may be stamped with a "best-if-purchased-by" date, which is then synonymous with the pull or "sell by" date. Fresh meat
packed at the store may have a "display date" to indicate the day it went on the food-store
shelf. Expiration dates may appear on a few items like baby formula and yeast as the last date
the item should be eaten or used. Although it is easy to agree that we ought to have shelf-life
dating for foods, designing a simplified and more consistent system is a major hurdle. Shelf
life depends on the initial quality of the food and its subsequent handling and storage. Most
foods need to be protected from heat, light and excess moisture. In general, the higher the
temperature during storage, the greater loss of food quality. Predictions of shelf life, then, are
relative estimates that assume a reasonable amount of care in food handling. Even the freshest
of poultry can quickly deteriorate if left for long at a warm temperature. A pack date on
wrapped chicken can help indicate freshness, but such information is valuable only if
appropriate food practices are followed, both in the supermarket and at home. Different kinds
of foods lend themselves to different types of open dating. Some, like salt and sugar, have
indefinite shelf lives and need no dating. They are not readily susceptible to microbial or
chemical degradation if kept dry. Other foods are difficult to date because shelf life may
depend greatly on how the product is stored. A "sell by" date on frozen fruits and vegetables
would be impractical because most degradation occurs after they leave the supermarket
freezer. The most desirable label for these foods is probably a "best-if-used-by" date that
includes storage and handling instructions. In short, the dates on foods mean different things
from one item to another, and it can be hard to decipher these numerous designations. Until a
better system is invented, one way to help maintain peak quality at the table is to try to buy
only as much as you are likely to use up well within the limits of freshness dating. The large
economy size that lasts far beyond its shelf life is hardly a bargain."<br>
---"Grocery Shoppers Need Interpreter for Shelf-Life Dates," Dr. Jean Mayer and Jeanne Goldberg, R D, <i>Chicago Tribune</i>,
August 22, 1985 (p. 13C)
<p>
<b>[1992]</b><br>
"Recent concern over a "PrimeTime Live" segment and other television investigations of
some supermarkets has raised questions about the meaning of dates on food packages. "Sell-by," "use-by," "expiration" and "pack" are references to dates a consumer might find on
supermarket products. And, then again, might not find. According to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, if a product is so stamped, here's what the designations mean:
- Sell-by date is the last day the product should be sold.
- Use-by date is the last top-eating-quality day.
- Expiration date is the last day the food should be eaten or used.
- Pack date is the date that lets the consumer know when the product was processed.
But the two main regulatory food agencies-the Department of Agriculture and the Food and
Drug Administration-have no ruling on mandatory dating of food packages, leaving it up to
the manufacturer and packager whether to advise consumers on the window of use for their
product."<br>
---"What dates on food products really mean," Beverly Bundy, <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, December 3, 1992 (p. 8) 
<p>
<b>[2014]</b><br>
"Except for infant formula and some baby food (see below), product dating is not required by
Federal regulations. However, if a calendar date is used, it must express both the month and
day of the month (and the year, in the case of shelf-stable and frozen products). If a calendar
date is shown, immediately adjacent to the date must be a phrase explaining the meaning of
that date such as "sell by" or "use before." There is no uniform or universally accepted system
used for food dating in the United States. Although dating of some foods is required by more
than 20 states, there are areas of the country where much of the food supply has some type of
open date and other areas where almost no food is dated."<br>

Long before we had modern medicine and nutrition science, people understood the relationship between what they ate and how
their bodies reacted. Ancient Greeks and Renaissance Europeans "prescribed" foods based on 
<a href="http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/contagion/humoraltheory.html">humoral theory</a>. Pre-industrial cookbooks typically
offered "invalid" recipes. 19th century technology launched a brand new academic field called
<a href="http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/homeEc/">Home Economics</a>. Educated Domestic Scientists and passionate health advocates
fueled the temperance movement. A new genre of culinary literature was introduced. Home economics textbooks and healthy diet 
cookbooks were promoted as modern alternatives to "your grandmother's cookbook." In the 1960s <a href="foodfaq1.html#glutenfreecookbooks">gluten free</a>
cook books surface.

Industrial-age American health advocates focused on the evils of adulterated 
foods and overeating. Several incorporate a fitness component. The twelve books featured below 
offer thoughtful starting points for exploring the range of ideas espoused in the USA 
in recent times. What do all of these authors/books have in common? A serious concern for improving the human condition and

Suggested beverages are fruit nectars, lemonades, cranberry juice and bran tea.

<b>[1915]</b> <i>The Nature Cure Cook Book and ABC of Natural Dietetics</i>/Mrs. Anna Lindlahr and Henry Lindlahr, M.D.<br>
...Vegetarian cook book based on the dietetics originated at the German School of Nature Cure. This book begins by dismissing
contemporary competing vegetarian cookbooks as uninformed. Recipes in this book are annotated to show their food elements 
(St. starches; S. sugar; F. fat; P. proteids, M. minerals). The authors recommend uncooked foods: "Nature did not create man with a
cookstove by his side." (p. 11) but does not prohibit cooking: "Peppers a la Creole" are baked for a half hour (p. 178).
<p>
<b>[1919]</b> <i>Diabetic Cookery: Recipes and Menus</i>/Rebecca W. Oppenheimer<br>
...Author Oppenheimer's preface tells her readers she is a diabetic who has sampled treatments at Carlsbad and Neuenahr. 
She notes..."Little has been done for the general public in this country in preparing special recipes for the diabetic, and in working out their food
values. Inasmuch as each person's carbohydrate tolerance is different, it is absolutely essential that the carbohydrate content
of each recipe be known; only then can it be safely used." (p. v). Ms. Oppenheimer's goal is to help caregiver/cooks
understand what diabetes is & give them everything they they need to know to compose diabetic-friendly meals. We home 
cooks confronted with adjusting family meals to meet this particular challenge "get it." 
<p>
<b>[1924]</b> <i>Physical Culture Cook Book</i>/Bernarr MacFadden<br>
...This movement launched in 1899 in "a world in which many foolish and artificial conceptions of life were prevalent. These ideas were a 
mixture of old superstitions and half baked-conceptions of new-born science...The catastrophe of the World War has...done much to
awaken people to a practical realization of the physical foundation of life...Health has become popular; a strong and 
beautiful body has become a thing of honor and glory..." (p. iii-iv). MacFadden comments on the positive aspects of nut/fruit, raw/natural, and 
vegetarian regimens. He advocates careful mastication (chewing), drinking water (hydration) and healthy cooking to 
unfold natural flavor (steaming vs boiling).
<p>
<b>[1944]</b> <i>Diet Does It</i>/Gayelord Hauser<br>
...Introducing the concept of "Super Foods," this ambitious holistic dietary text fed the timeless table of social concerns. Chapters titled
"Overcoming Faulty Elimination...The newer way to internal cleanliness," "Eat and Become Slender," "Goodbye to That Tired
Feeling: Fighting fatigue with diet," "Beauty is as Beauty Eats: Specific foods for the skin, hair, eyes, and teeth" and "Live longer,
 Look Younger." This book's preface was penned in Beverly Hills, California. Makes perfect sense in context.
<p>
<b>[1955]</b> <i>Raw Vegetable Juices</i>/N.W. Walker<br>
...Cookbook offering recipes from Alfalfa to Watercress Juice. 'How much juice can be take safely?...As a general rule one
pint daily is the least that will show any perceptible results and preferably from two to eight pints of more." (p. 11). How
to make your home juice? This book promotes electric Triturator and Hydraulic Press Home Juicers. Original
book was published in 1936, revised enlarged edition 1947.
<p>
<b>[1961]</b> <i>Foods for Glamour</i>/Jack LaLanne<br>
...Mr. LaLanne was a body builder, fitness crusader, and popular TV fitness show host in the 1960s. This book not a
cookbook but a holistic approach to eating and fitness based on making healthy choices. To Mr. LaLanne, truly glamorous 
people are healthy and vibrant. Detailed discussions of the properties of common foods (chicken, bananas, potatoes, eggs etc.) 
and general notes on cooking styles are offered. The solo recipe in this book is for party popcorn balls (p. 230).
<p>
<b>[1972]</b> <i>Weight Watchers Program Cookbook</i>/Jean Nidetch<br>
...Weight Watchers began in 1963. The original cookbook was published in 1966. Our revised edition incorporates the latest
changes. This plan's success was based on a scientific Menu Plans calculated to reduce calories 
while permitting followers enjoy familiar foods. In this book, "dietetic" products are not permitted except artifical sweeteners, 
carbonated beverages and imitation butter products. Baked lasagne, enchiladas, and chicken tetrazzini prepared from this
book are okay. This cook book offers two options: the new "Leveling Plan" and the "Maintenance Plan." The book's primary
purpose is to offer "legal" recipes.
<p>
<b>[1980]</b> <i>Richard Simmons' Never Say Diet Book</i>/Richard Simmons<br>
...Popular TV fitness show host, Mr. Simmons promoted the "Live-It" food program. Best known for his never-ending high energy
level and aerobic excersizes, he advocated passionately against junk food and overeating. "How to tell if you're an overeater" and 
"The Painful but Very Honest Image Test" invite readers to examine their lifestyles in simple terms. The "Live-It" program
offer 3 plans, based on the amount of weight the dieter targeted to lose. This book offers general guidelines for healthy eating
choices and a tiny handful of recipes.
<p>
<b>[1990]</b> <i>The Nutri/System Flavor Set-Point Weight-Loss Cookbook</i>/Susan S Schiffman, Ph.D. and Joan Scobey<br>
...Nutri/System launched in 1971. Like Weight Watchers, it opened a national chain of weight-loss centers and sold commercially
prepared food. This company focused on low-calorie meal plans, behavioral and nutritional counsleing, and exercize. The Nutri/Syetem
programs coatains a 1000-calorie meal plan. The "Flavor Set-Point Theory" was based on the premise that overweight people crave intensified
flavor and varied texture. Recipes are noted
for their calories, fat content, carbs, protein, sodium, cholesterol and calcium. Menus are based on an "Exchange" system. 
Fettuccini with Mushroom Stroganoff, Zucchini Parmesan, and Key Lime Pie okay. Special emphasis on exotic Asian, Middle Eastern and
Indian cuisine.

<dt><font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Interpreting & adapting historic recipes</b></font><p>
Cooking dishes from original historic recipes can be very challenging. Even if you're lucky
enough to have access to ancient roasting pits, colonial beehive ovens, conestoga kitchens and
fireless cookers. Most old recipes were not much more than shopping lists with cursory prep notes.
Step-by-step instructions were omitted because it was understood the cook already knew the basics.  
After the cake was baked a "hot oven" to "light brown" it was "served forth" when it was "done." 
<p>
Before "standardized" measuring units, cooks used six different types of measures, each posing special challenges for today's recreating cooks. NOTE: They were 
not problems for the cooks back in the day, as they were familiar with the terms and measures. Baking is a relational science relying on consistent proportions and oven
temperatures. 
It was not until the industrial revolution, when it became cheap to
 produce kitchenware and ovens had F. marks, that "standard" measures became popular. Promoted by heavyweight home economists (think: Fannie Farmer & Sara Tyson Rorer), they 
were embrace by "modern" cooks. Early 20th century cookbooks provided long lists helping cooks "translate" their old recipes into the new formulae. The same 
held true for oven temperatures (hot, very hot, slow, fast). Today we find remnants of the old measures in some recipes. Visual and tactile cues transcend time.
<p>
<b>Pre-standardized food measures generally fall into these categories:</b><ul>
<li><b>Weight (a pound of flour)</b> 
...Considered the most accurate measure, even today. But? different grains/grinds had different weights; humidity also made flour heavier. 
<li><b>Volume (cups, wineglasses, teaspoons, saltspoons, basters) </b>
...Before standardization these could be any size. A cook relying on her own measuring devices could reproduce consistent results. Today's cooks trying to reproduce historic recipes are challenged by these measures because we don't know what size "grandma's" teacups were. 
<li><b>Relational (butter the size of an egg) </b>
...Modern cooks overthink this, mostly because we have different sizes of eggs in our supermarkets. Most eggs back in the day were small. Chickens were not fed industrial/chemical nutrient enhanced grain. 
<li><b>Price (5 cents ammonia; a 10 cent can of tomatoes) </b>
...If the recipe is dated, these amounts can be identified using food ads published in old newspapers. If it is undated, it's almost impossible because prices fluctuate according to supply, demand and season. 
<li><b>Cook's experience (enough, until it feels like) </b>
...Today's bread recipes still include this. You can measure your ingredients but when it comes to achieving the perfect bread dough you go by feel. 
<li><b>Personal taste & larder variables (salt to taste, as you like it,  if you have them)</b> 
...Spices, nuts, dried fruit, &c. can be incorporated a little or a lot. Local apples were used for pie. Baking powder came in different strengths (single, double acting).
</ul>
<br>

<a href="food2.html#conversions">Weights & measurements</a> are likewise time/country/food specific. Did
you know some culinary historians say we Americans measure with objects (as opposed to
weight) because of our pioneer heritage? Conestoga wagons had plenty of cups & spoons but
very few reliable scales. Family recipes specifying "5 tins" of sugar are among the most challenging. The omission of flour
measures is brilliant. Why? Prior to modern supermarket flour, this variable item created
different products according to grain, grind, season, and storage. A good cook knew when the flour was enough by feel & texture.
Measurements and detailed cooking instructions were a by-product of the Industrial Revolution
and are commonly attributed to Fannie M. Farmer, principal of the Boston Cooking School.
<p>
There is no single place to obtain all of the historic conversions necessary to redact (interpret & recreate)
original historic receipts in your kitchen. This does not mean your task is impossible.
Quite the contrary. 
<p>
<b>General guidelines for recreating historic recipes:</b>
<ul>
<li>If you are working with an original text look for notes regarding measurements used<br>
---guidelines for the new cook, conversion charts or handwritten notes
<li>Check current & adapted cookbooks for similar recipes<br>
---this will help interpret the *hot* oven (475 degrees) & provide modern measurements
<li>Use common sense--if the recipe seems to call for too much salt, cut it down<br>
---maybe the salt used in ancient times was much more concentrated than today?
<li>Ask for help! Many <a href="http://www.alhfam.org/index.php?cat_id=120&nav_tree=120">living history
museums</a> have staff who specialize in foodways (recreating original recipes, cooking in old
kitchens & cultivating heirloom gardens). The trick is to find the right person. Be sure to check
the museum's description to get the right location and time period (Old Sturbridge Village
recreates inland Massachusetts in 1830s) BEFORE you contact the foodways people.
<li>No matter how close you come to the original recipe the end-product will probably taste
different from what people ate long ago. Even if you cook it in the *traditional* way. Why?
Because the food we buy today is different from the food they used back then.<br>

<b>Historic American weights, measures, equivalents & adaptations</b><br>
Late 19th/early 20th century cookbooks provide the most reliable primary data for linking traditional amounts with modern measures. Home economists
devoted themselves to interpreting and standardizing the old measures. Butter the "size of an egg" became 2 oz; butter
the "size of a walnut" became 1 oz. Hot, quick, moderate & slow ovens were assigned farenheight temperatures. Imagine
the challenge our foremothers faced trying to recalculate family favorites to accomodate new cooking technology. Can sizes likewise 
morphed. Anyone today know how much a WWII-era No. 2 1/2 sized can held (weight/volume)? Recipes specifying ingredients by price or size
(<a href="food2.html#5centsmarshmallows">5 cents worth of marshmallows</a>; box of Jell-O, <a href="foodfaq.html#paperofcornstarch">paper of cornstarch</a>) or
<a href="food2.html#raceginger">race of ginger</a> are the most challenging of all. Context clues (Chicago 1893?) are gold. If you have a measure you can't decipher

<a name="5centsmarshmallows">
<b>What amount was "5 cents worth of marshmallows?"</b><br>
Ingredient amounts expressed in cost are among the most difficult to identify because the answer depends upon year, place,
 and point of sale. Identifying quantifiable prices (weight, can size, volume) is key. "Marshmallows, 15 cents/package"
does not provide enough data to interpret actual amount. <a href="http://www.foodtimeline.org/1919marshallows.pdf">"Pushing Marshmallows"</a> 1919 describes
various brands, packaging and price points.
<p>
Our survey of historic USA newspapers confirms the phrase "5 cents worth of marshmallows" was popular from 1907-1924. 
Marshmallow recipes also used product counts (16 marshmallows). These amounts suggest marshmallows might have been sold in 
5 cent packages (not found) or individually at confectionery shops (also not found). 
<p>
There are two ways to discover the exact amount of ingredients expressed by cost. Neither is exact. Both can come close.<br>
<b>1. Period newspaper advertisements</b><br>
Our research confirms marshmallows were sold by weight: quarter, half, 1 and 5 pound
boxes. Then, as today, prices depended upon point of sale: grocery store, department store, confectioner. The bigger the container,
the cheaper the per/marshmallow price.
Pound prices in this our target 
period ranged from 22-40 cents/lb, generally averaging 25 cents/lb. The most descriptive ad we found was this:<br>
"Jack Frost Marshmallows...Pound (80 pieces) 25 cents."<br>
...display ad, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, November 7, 1921 (p. II17)<br>
<b>CONCLUSION: "5 cents worth" may be approximately 1/5-1/4 lb.</b>
<p>
<b>2. Find the same recipe in another source (magazine, cookbook, newspaper) in the same general time period, using 
different measurements.</b><br>
The problem with this method, of course, is that very similar recipes may support different proportions, according the the
author.  The recipes we found using this phrase produced cake filling and fruit-studded dessert creams. 
<p>
Mass-produced <a href="foodcandy.html#marshmallows">marshmallows</a> were very popular in the 
early 20th century. 


<p>
<a name="raceginger">
<b>What is a "race" of ginger?</b><br>
Our research indicates a "race" of ginger is a root, sometimes also called a hand. This indicates the fresh, raw root, not
 a mediated variation (ground ginger, 
ginger sticks, etc.). We do not find any notes regarding converting this for modern redactions (as in, how big was the 'average' ginger root in the 18th century?). 
Your best bet is to examine other ginger recipes in your original source for possible proportions. Modern tastes & recipes are not generally accurate guides for 
recreating historic flavors. Good luck!

<a name="receipts">
<b>Why are some old recipes called "receipts?"</b><br>
According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, the words "receipt" and  "recipe" date in English
print to the 15th century. The original meaning of both words was medical in nature. They
derived from Latin and were used by physicians to head prescriptions. The abbreviation Rx
derives from this. Up until the 20th century it was common practice to combine both formulae
for food and medicine/home remedies in one book. "Recipe," meaning a "statement of
ingredients and procedure necessary for the making or compounding of some preparation, esp. of
a dish of cookery," dates in print to 1743.
<p>
<b>"Receipt, recipe.</b><br>
The similarity betweeen these two words is understandable since they both come from the same
Latin word recipere (to take back or receive). Recipe is the present tense, imperative, meaning
literally "Take!" From the earliest days of medicine, recipe has been used as the first word in
prescriptions, either spelled out, or in recent times, abbreviated by the letter R with a slant mark
across its base. Though recipe is still used primarily in this medical sense, it has also long been
used to designate any list of ingredients, as in cooking recipes. Receipt comes from the past
participle of recipere and originally meant "that which has been received," Since receipts are
traditionally handed down from experienced to inexperienced cooks, these formulas are
"received" by one from the other. Formerly receipt was used to indicate a list of medical
ingredients as well as a table of ingredients for cooking, but in modern times it is used solely as a
culinary term."<br>
---<i>Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins</i>, William and Mary Morris [Harper & Row:New York]
1962 (p. 290) 
<p>
The study of word usage is an inexact science. The first instance in print often lags years behind
popular use. Conversely, print evidence often remains long after a word is falls into falls to
disuse.<p>
Our survey of 18th and 19th century American cookbooks reveals the term "receipt" is routinely
employed prior to the Civil War. Cook books published between 1870-1899 use both terms,
although not in the same book. "Modern" books (those written by domestic scientists and home
economists) appear to have preferred the term recipe. Indeed, these authors sought to distance
themselves from the traditional practice of combining culinary dishes and home remedies. Diets
for invalids became the object of scientific study and patented medicines replaced home
remedies. Perhaps this explains the eventual acceptance of the word recipe in place of the "old
fashioned"  receipt. As the we march toward the 20th century we find the word receipt falling
toward disuse.

Like fire, the microwave oven cookery was discovered by accident. Follow the fascinating journey from science lab to American 
home kitchens. Innovative and trendy, microwave ovens were first purchased by well-off American home cooks in the 1960s.
Twenty years later, they were the norm in average USA kitchens. We learned much, mostly from trial and error. Microwaved
turkeys don't crisp up. Microwave popcorn...booya!

"In 1942, a Raytheon inventor, Percy L. Spencer, 
noted that a chocolate bar melted in his pocket while he was testing a radar tube. The then cut a hole in a kettle, 
inserted an electron tube and by 1949 Raytheon patented its 'Radarrange." Designed for restaurants, the early 1953 models
 were oversized, cost about $3,000 and turned out bilious grey meat and limp french fries. They were duds for about a 
decade, remaining alien to many consumers. The Irish cook of Charles Adams, Raytheon's chairman who turned his kitchen
 into a proving ground, called the ovens 'black magic' and quit."<br>

"Radar, the war-time magic ear, now is ready to move into the kitchens of America in the form of electronics cooking. Cleveland
newsmen were given a preview of the raytheon radarange by the Brandt Company, the first distributor of the 
revolutionary oven which prepares food in a fraction of a jiffy...a raytheon magnetron tube is the heart of the 
radarange. It is the same tube found in all radar sets. Since the cooking is done by radio frequency energy, the
radarange has a band of frequencies between 2,400 and 2,500 megacycles, authorized by the federal communcations
commission. Whereas radiant heating cooks from the surface inward, the radarange cooks all parts of the food
simultaneously. The rapid cooking does not permit natural oils and flavoring to esacape. There is no grease, smoke or
odors. The Brandt Company plans to lease the radarange to restaurants and hotel at first. But it probably won't be long before
mother can wait until she hears father come in the door evenings, then she pops the food in the radarange and has it on the
table ready to eat by the time her husband has his coat off."<br>

"A group of gourmets sampled the first radar-cooked dinner in American history here yesterday after watching a manufacturing company's
food consultant whip up a banquet on a radar range in what must be record time. Eat and run advocates among the diners were well
pleased not only with the food but by the fact cooking required only 3 minutes 45 seconds. Baked lobster needed 2 minutes 15
seconds. Broiled sirloin steak with bernaise sauce was prepared in 50 seconds. Grilled ham steaks were given 1 minute in the
oven. Hot fresh apple pie with melted cheese came out of the oven in 10 seconds."<br>

"The housewife of 1952 will be able to stick a raw steak on a dinner plate, slide it in an oven that isn't hot and serve it, cooked
and simmering, 30 seconds later. And, in that not too distant golden age, there will be no need for potholders, tin pans and
aprons. The food gets very hot but the plates stay cool. There is no grease splattering and tin pans just won't work in the
new 'Radarrange'--a radar cooker. Its manufacturers say the device is the 'only new heat application to cooking since the
discovery of fire over 2,000 years ago.'...There are only a few in existence...because improvements are being made so fast that 
a model can be obsolete in a couple of months. These few are on lease to hotels in Boston, Washington, Cleveland and
Buffalo. The company is working on models for Navy ships and Army airplanes and expects to have one ready for homes in three to
five years. Newsmen here saw--and enjoyed the results--of a radar range that turns out baked stuffed lobster and broiled chicken
 in 2 1/2 minutes instead of 30. Diced potatoes take 25 seconds. Vegetables need no water and corn-on-the-cob needs only 40 seconds.
The not-quite obsolete model now is aobut the size of a domestic refrigerator and lined with aluminum. There's room for
eight chickens inside and a clockwatch button that automatically turns off when the cooking time is up."<br>

"Radar cooking is being tested in Cornell's home economics college in a research project sponsored by the navy. The process 
actually is dielectric or high frequency cooking but is popularly called 'radar' cooking because it operates on the same
principle. Results have been highly successful so far...The oven, all metal, has a glass window at the rear which admits high
frequency waves which are circulated by revolving antennae at the top of the oven. The product cooks all at once as the high
frequency waves set up friction within the molecules of the food. Oven glass or pottery containers must be used in radar cooking
because metal reflects the waves, sending them away from the food. With this unusual cooking method, the oven always is cool and
pot holders are not used. Pencil size holes in the oven door afford the cook an opportunity to watch progress of the food, but are
so sized and spaced that the high frequency waves cannot escape. The navy has contracted with Miss Kathryn Causey, research
associated of the school of nutrition, to test palatability, nutritive value, weight losses and bacterial count of ground 
beef, lamb and pork cooked in the radar oven, as compared with those meats cooked by usual methods. So far, she reports, there is
little difference, except the radar oven doesn't brown meat...Baked goods such as bread and cake are a failure in the radar
oven. They rise so quickly the baking powder doesn't have time to act. Several flour mills are working on recipes adapted to high
frequency baking. Boiling eggs in a radar oven is disastrous. The eggs explode in three seconds. Miss Causey believes radar cooking
must undergo many revisions before the homemaker can use it. So far the equipment is too costly. An oven rents for $5 a day and will
retail at about $2,600. On to of that, timing is very important. Ten seconds over or under cooking may ruin the food."<br>

"Electronic heating, or microwave cooking, is only two years old, commercially speaking...It was long known by little used

cut hours from the housewife's cooking day. The company put out a 'radarrange' for restaurants, hotels and other 
commercial establishments. It sold for $2,975--a tidy sum for a stove. Last year Raytheon licensed the Tappan Stove 
Company to make the first domestic model. This year a license agreement was signed with the General Electric Company's 
Hotpoint affiliate. Prices will run from $1,000 to $1,200. This is still high, but prices should drop as mass production

users of the equipment are in no danger from contact with the potent waves. When the door of the radar stove is opened the
equipment turns itself off automatically. It is the first such installation in this area of the state...Because of the newness

"A single slice of piping hot apple pie topped with a wedge of melting cheese served 15 seconds after being ordered or a 
complete turkey platter ready to eat less than to minutes after removal from refrigerated storage are not fantasies of the
 future. These are but two of many fully or partly prepared dishes that can be ready for service in less than two minutes
 with the aid of a microwave oven. Although microwave ovens have been manufactured for abut 15 years, their acceptance and
 use in homes and restaurants has been limited. This is due partly to high costs and slow realization that they are 
adjuncts to conventional cooking methods rather than replacements for regular ovens...Airlines have probably been the
 biggest users of microwave ovens, thought experiments in other food service operations have been tried. Two years ago, 
the Frank G. Shattuck Company, which operated Schrafft's restuarants, installed a Thermowave oven in one of its 
restaurants. Favorable response by employees and customers led to installation of similar ovens in five other Schrafft's 
restaurants. Because of its compact size (18 1/2 wide by 24 inches deep), simple plug-in electrical needs and presetting 
features, the Thermowave oven lends itself well to ounter operations, particularly where the kitchen is removed from the
 service area. The food on a service plate is placed on a turntable inside the oven, and a temperature sensing device
 determines when the food is fully heated. The dish can be removed with the bare hand because microwave energy passes 
through any insulator such as glass, paper, china and some plastics without heating them. When the oven is operating, the 
turntable revolves slowly to ensure even heating throughout the food. A wide selection of foods can be prepared in a 
central commissary for shipment, frozen or refrigerated, to an outlet with a microwave oven for "reconstitution." 
Schrafft's commissary supplies hamburgers, French-toasted sandwiches, beef pie and apple pie with cheese for microwave 
menu listings. ..Thermowave ovesn are also part of many of Schrafft's commercial fod operations both in waitress-service
 situations and customer-operated vending machine operations. The feeding of employes through vending machines is an 
increasingly popular method in small companies and especially for those companies on a 24-hour schedule. Complete dishes
 on dispoable paper or plastic dishes are stored in a refrigerated vending machine to be released when coins are inserted
 and then heated in an adjacent microwave oven. The New York State Pavilion at the World's Fair includes customer-operated
 Thermowave ovens near the snack counter. Manufacturers of the unit forsee the day when hospitals and other institutions
 will use microwave ovens to provide a greater variety of hot meals."<br>

<b>Who was Percy Spencer?</b><br>
"Dr. Percy L. Spencer, retired senior vice president of the Raytheon Company...and a well-known inventor...held more than 130 patents, 
among them the application of microwave energy to medical diathermy, high-frequency devices and electronic tubes. He developed the special tubes that made possible
the proximity fuses introduced in World War II. For this work he received the Naval Ordnance Award. Dr. Spencer was the fifth employe to joing the then infant
Raytheon Company in 1925. Perhaps his first accomplishment was to help in developing the first gaseous rectifier tube that made the radio a common household 
plug-in applicance. An article in the 'most unforgettable character' series in the Reader's Digest in August, 1958, described Dr. Spencer as 'an orphan who never
graduated from grammar school, he has demonstrated that nothing is beyond the grasp of a man who wants to know what is going on, and who feels a sense of 
responsibility for doing something about it.' Dr. Spencer was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree by the University of Massachusetts and by Nasson College
in Maine. He also held an honorary degree from the University of Maine. He was a fellow of the American Academy of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics

<b>True or false: paper cups were initially promoted for convenience by large paper manufacturers in order to boost sales.<br>
False.</b> Paper drinking cups were promoted by 19th century public health officials to stave off diseases festering in public drinking venues. The water was
 generally fresh. The fountains were sometimes questionable. The public drinking cups were swarming hotbeds of communicable disesase. 
School children regularly shared cups that were not properly sanitized between drinks. Hospitals, military messes, railroads, 
hotels, soda fountains, factory cafeterias, vending machines, and picnickers quickly embraced the inexpensive sanitary disposable paper cup. In the 1920s, 
 Congress announced they were using paper cups in their cafeterias; confirming government committiment to resolving serious sanitation issues.

"It is a very dull week in the reform business that does not witness the advent of one or more new projects...One of the latest reform movements originating with the medical profession is the individual drinking cup. The agitation began in the churches, with a discussion of the dangers incident to the using of a common chalice at communion services. Already a number of churches have adopted the plan of individual chalices, and the reform is spreading. It is taking a wider range than that of religious bodies, for doctors and many others are now opposing all promiscuously used drinking cups. Numerous medical societies are discussing the subject, and in so doing are successfully exploiting the germ theory. The Homeopathic Society of Philadelphia is especially conspicuous in this movement. At a recent meeting it adopted resolutions in the Quaker City to discontinue the use of common cups in the public schools. It has also asked the railway companies to take the public drinking cups out of their cars and out of the railway stations. The Philadelphia homeopaths have in view a sweeping change--the entire abolition of the common drinking vessel and the inauguration of individual vessels. They would have the ladles removed from public pumps and hydrants in streets, hotels, steamboats, theaters, and all other places of public resort. A necessary condition of life, or, at any rate, of comfort, under this plan would be the carrying about of a drinking vessel by every person. The drinking cup would be individualized as much as the toothbrush or packet handkerchief. One of the doctors has already suggested water-proof paper cups to be kept at schools. He says they would be so cheap that they could be destroyed as soon as used. No movement of this kind can be carried into effect at once, but if, on thorough investigation, this is deemed wise and expedient, it will be generally adopted. There will be no difficulty in providing cups at insignificant cost that can be slipped into a vest pocket. There is little room for doubt that diseases are spread by the common use of drinking vessels."

"A handy folding drinking cup of waterproof paper comes in a flat, folded package that fits in a vest pocket. When opened it forms a cylindrical vessel bound with wire and having a wire handle. It holds about a cupful of cold water, milk, tea or medicines. It can be used to hold hot liquids, but can only be used once, or at most twice. A cup filled with cold water stood for eight hours without injury and was then dried, refolded, and used again several times. It is useful in traveling, in camp and in the sickroom--Women's Home Companion."

"Another new step in the universal fight against disease has been made in the adoption by the bureau of charities of the individual drinking cup machine, a device which does away with the old time common drinking cup, so often a means of disease communication. The bureau purposes to install the machines in the poorer quarters of the city, where cleanliness and sanitary conditions about drinking facilities are unobtainable. The danger from the drinking cup handed from hand to hand and used by scores of persons in a single day has long been recognized by physicians and health authorities throughout the country...The individual drinking cup machine guards against these evils by presenting each drinker with a brand new white paraffin paper cup. The device is automatic and may be equipped with a coin operating adjunct if desired. In some places fountains have been established where for a cent dropped in the slot one may obtain a clean cup filled to the brim with ice cold water. The machine is made of white enamel with a bottle of water inverted in the top like an ordinary cooler. The cups are manufactured by an automatic process and are not touched by the hand until they are filled, ready for use...School-children, particularly in the poor districts of large cities, have been the chief victims of disease spread by old fashioned cups, and this has resulted in the establishment of the "bubble fountain," similar to those The Tribune recently placed on the streets of Chicago, and the introduction of individual cups. In many schools each child is supplied with a paraffin cup, and this is replaced as soon as it becomes soiled."

Vortex products are cone-shaped...The business started in 1911 with $25,000 capital...Its success has been due to able management; the invention of automatic machinery by Mr. Cesare Barbieri, the Company's consulting engineer; patent protection on machinery, processes and products, and the increasing public use of paper cups because they are sanitary and cheap. Health officials in many states are becoming increasingly active in enforcing laws and sanitary regulations pertaining to public drinking places and soda fountains. Vortex products...are in widespread use in factories, offices, stores, soda fountains, hotels, restaurants, oil filling stations, railroads, steamships, etc."

"A guest list more distinguished than usually graces a formal White House dinner was represented today at a 'hot dog" luncheon given by President Roosevelt at his 
cottage, located two miles from the Summer White House...The guests, ranging from prominent ones to chauffeurs, found paper plates, paper cups and knives and 
forks and filed past the tables in line."
<br>---"President is Host at 'Hot-Dog' Feast," <i>New York Times</i>, September 23, 1934 (p. N1)

The classic New York City coffee cup (blue & white Greek design) dates to the 1960s:<br>
"They're everywhere, stacked high behind counters in diners, on the cover of the Manhattan phone book and in the hands of the homeless. Like yellow taxicabs, 
they represent New York City. And unlike so many cab drivers, these omnipresent city icons project an unfailingly polite image. "We are happy to serve you" is the 
phrase printed on the side of the blue paper cups. Frank Padia, a 43-year-old business owner, has never stopped to acknowledge the cups' message, their origin or 
even why he drinks coffee. As he stepped out of Tom's Restaurant -- the Upper West Side diner made famous on "Seinfeld" -- he held a cup of extra-strong Greek 
coffee capped with a lid. "No, no, never thought about them," he said. "I guess because they've been around so long and because you see them all over the place." 
"We are happy to serve you" is in Greek letters above three steaming cups of coffee and between two pillars. There's also a Greek vase, and the blue and white colors that have made the cups instantly recognizable to New Yorkers since the Sherri Cup Company introduced the "Anthora" design more than three decades ago.
"The design has been around since 1963," said Wayne Meadowcroft, Sherri's vice president of sales and marketing. "At the time, most of the diners and delis were
 Greek-owned, so the design, which was by an employee, Leslie Buck, was a natural."'<br>
