The following menus, both authentic and extrapolated, represent a progression of
Anglo-perspective American Christmas dinners from the 17th century to the 1970s. They are prescriptive visions
on the Christmas tables of melting-pot America. Then, as today, you would be hard-pressed to find a Christmas table
laden with all the festive dishes suggested in popular cookbooks and magazines. The true American Christmas feast honors traditional
holiday favorites from all points of the globe. While some people feast on roast beef and mashed
potatoes, others celebrate with baccala and lasagne. Histories of selected popular <a href="christmasfood.html">Christmas foods</a>.
Then, as today, home cooks reconcile 
family tradition with contemporary suggestions and economic challenges. At the end of the day? Most of us cook what we know.

Cookbooks at this time were written by and for the wealthy. The following  menu reflects what an
English nobleman might have served his guests at Christmas. Some early American settlers might
have considered these foods "traditional" holiday fare, even though they probably set a simpler
table. <b>Note:</b> Not all colonial-era Christian Americans celebrated Christmas. Think:

Most late 18th and early 19th century cookbooks do not contain menus or "bills of fare," except,
perhaps by season. What we know about Christmas dinners in this period is gleaned primarily
from journals, letters, household inventories, and other primary sources. Most of the following
menus are drawn by culinary historians and gifted chefs who have endeavored to replicate
authentic period meals. Many contain modernized recipes.

Christmas menus reflect traditonal foods of the celebrant's original culture. In all times and places, the foods served for this holiday (and ingredients used) reflect the 
very best possible items available to the family. 
As you can imagine, pioneer American Christmas menus varied greatly. Christmas menus depended upon: <ul>
<li>  <b>Location</b>...cities offered more food choices than rural outposts 
<li> <b>Situation</b>...families living in homes/villages had more options than those living in camp-like quarters 
<li> <b>Economics</b>...the wealthier the famly, the better grade food afforded (fine white flour vs coarse brown) 
<li> <b>Heritage</b>...people cook what they know...Scandinavian pioneers in Minnesota set different traditional tables from the Germans from Russia in North Dakota, 
French Basques in Nevada, Dutch in Michigan, etc. </ul>
General popular Christmas foodstuffs of the period included roast beef, turkey, ham, potatoes, pickles, fine white bread, fruitcakes, cookies, pies. Oysters were
 treasured. Tinned oysters were available in some major cities but were expensive. Some families might have been able to afford them; others not. Chocolate, tea, 
and coffee were likewise imported and not always available. 
Most of what we know about pioneer era Christmas tables is gleaned from primary sources: letters, journals, peronal inventories, etc. Period cookbooks and 
menus only serve as period guides. If you need this information for a child's report, we recommend <li>The Little House Cookbook: Frontier Foods from Laura

<b>[1847]<br>
"To Arrange a Christmas Dinner.</b> Place a high pyramid of evergreens (made as before
directed) in the centre of the table. Let a roasted turkey of uncommon size occupy the middle or
centre of one side of the table, on one end let there be a cold boiled ham, and at the other,
fricasseed chicken or a roast pig; with the turkey serve mashed potatoes and turnips, boiled
onions and dressed celery, or other salad with apple sauce--near the ham place fried or mashed
potatoes and pickles or mangoes: and with the pig or fricassee, the same as with the turkey; large
pitchers of sweet cider (or where that is not desired, ice water) should be placed diagonally
opposite each other, on two corners of the table; boiled turkey with oyster sauce may occupy the
place of the fricassee, or instead, a fine oyster pie. For dessert, there should be only two very large
and ornamental mince pies, one sufficiently large that each of the company may be helped from it,
in token of common interest, is desirable. Ice creams and jellies and jams and ripe fruits and nuts,
with sweet cider and syrup water of different sorts, or wines, complete the dessert. Biscuit and
jelly sandwich may be served at dessert, or paste puffs and charlotte de russe or blancmange with
strands of jelly."<br>

"Christmas Dinner</b> This table should be laid as for any other company dinner, the necessary adjuncts being at had on the
sideboard or another table, as heretofore directed. It is a modern fancy to introduce a centre cloth of embroidered linen, or
squares and ovals of plush, on which the epergne is set; but practical housekeepers would generally prefer a low dish of ferns or
scarlet geraniums mingled with white carnations, having for a base a round mirror whose outer edge could be hidden under a
wreath of evergreen, and upon whose surface some stray leaves or blossoms have fallen as if by accident. In cities and towns, where
raw oysters can be had, they are often used as a first course. They should be opened and the shell washed an hour or so before dinner, and be put in a 
cold place. When wanted for the table, if one has not proper oyster-plates, arrange six of these shells, with an oyster in each, on a
dessert-plate, with the narrow part of the shell inward, all meeting in the centre, where two or three slices of lemon are laid. 
Small crackers are passed, in addition to the bread on the napkin, and the pepper and the salt should be within reach. The second
course may be breaded mutton-chops, accompanied with canned French peas. A haunch of venison and boiled cauilflower, with drawn butter
poured over the latter, would make an acceptable second course. The venison should be purchased several days in advance and hung
in a cool place, and should be washed off five or six times with vinegar. On Christmas morning it should be washed with warm water, with a dash of
cold water at the last. The wipe perfectly dry and enclose it in a covering of dough made of flour and water rolled into a thickness of not
more than half an inch. Encase this in two layers of white wrapping-paper and secure with a string. Fill a dripping-pan a third full of 
hot water and baste ofen, adding to it from the tea-kettle as it evaporates. Frequent basting will keep the paper from scorching; and when 
thorougly cooked--which will require from two to three hours--take form the oven about three-fourths of an hour before dinner, remove all the
coverings, rub well with butter and dredge with flour, and then return to the oven. Repeat this butter-basting two or three times, till the meat is nicely browned and a
'glaze' formed. Garnish the venison with alternate slices of lemon and pickled beet-root. Season the gravy with a large spoonful of currant
jelly and the juice of half a lemon. Other suitable vegetables to be passed with venison are mashed turnips, mashed potato, or sweet
potato. If a turkey is thorugh to be a necessitiy to complete the Christmas dinner, he should be perpared for the table as directed on 
page 119. When dihsed, it will be an improvement to garnish him with oysters carefully crumbed and fried. Cranberry sauce should be passed with
roast turkey. Chicken salad may follow this course, cheese and crackers coming next. Everything save the ornamental centre-
pice will now be removed from the table, and the crumbs brushed from the cloth, making the entrance of the mince-pies, fruits, nuts, and
raisins now in order. Ices will be reslished after highly-seasoned pastried, and light fancy cakes may be passed with them. Oranges, 
grapes, and the late pears are ordinarily offered, and last of all should com the little cups of black coffee, accompanied by
cream and sugar. it sould be of good strength, as we fuly assent to the statement that 'well-bred and sensible people do not affect pale and watery
decoctions after a hearty dinner.'"<br>

Christmas Day, It has been our custom, as well as the custom of other household writers, to devote much time to Christmas
dinners, their bills of fare and preparations, entirely losing sight of the fact that most people eat three times a day on 
Christmas, as well as on other days of the year, so in this article we will give three bills of fare. Let the breakfast be simple,
plain and nutritious, served early, as on this morning the children of the house usually arise early, and a late breakfast makes too short
a space before the heavy dinner, and the children, in consequence, suffer for perhaps a week to come from indigestion, cuase by 
cramping, and, by the way, I think as a rule Christmas dinners are too heavy to be thorougly enjoyed and digested. We are  living in the days of
civilization and refinement, and not in the days of King Richard II, at whose table thirty courses were served at a Christmas 
dinner and it is said that the fragments that remained were more than sufficient to serve a thousand persons. Of coruse, great
numbers were invited; but imagine the waste and the heavy laden table with such a quantity of left over. The feast given in Westminster
Hall, in 1399, was such a large and coarse affair, that twenty-six oxen, three hundred sheep, besides fowls without number, were put upon the table
and consumed.

"Christmas Menus</b> For the ordinary company dinner all sorts of novelties are looked for and bills of fare are made as unique
as possible. Not so much with the Christmas dinner; it has remained unchanged for many generations. Christmas would not be Chritams
without the turkey or goose, plum pudding and sugar-plums. The pudding for the feast should be made at least two months before the occasion, 
and put away to ripen and become mellow and rich. Not so the candies; they should be as fresh as possible, not more than a day
old, and should be kept in tin boxes and in a dry place. Cranberry jelly will be made always the day before. The turkey drawn
and hung in a cold place for at least one day before roasting. If turkey or goose cannot be procured, a large chicken will answer very well. A 
fruit pudding is less expensive than plum pudding, but must be palatable and well made. The perfect menu combines the luxuries of
the season without great expenditure of either time or money. Dinner should not be so elaborate that it is entirely beyond the 
capacity of the cook or the housewife to whom the preparation is assigned. Select vegetables that are in season. Use holly, cedar and 
mistletoe for decorations, or ground pine and partridge berry. Do not use roses or other hot-house flowers, as they are entirely
inappropriate.

is a very simple one, and, wiht the exception of the goose, will be comparatively inexpensive. Get a Boston goose. It will cost 30--
perhaps 35--cents a pound, but every one is guaranteed and the Boston bird is the only goose brought to the New York market
fit to eat."<br>

"The Christmas dinner menu</b> was probably made out days ago; mincemeat and plum pudding, perhaps, have been standing
on the cupboard shelf for weeks; the butcher has the order for a goose or a turkey or a chicken, as the case may be, and even the
vegetables are probably waiting in cellar or pantry to be cooked. But even after the Christmas dinner is cleared away tomorrow, the
housewife's worries over the holiday fare are not ended, for there still remains the Christmas supper to plan and prepared...
The Christmas supper should be appetizing and satisfying, but it should not be very hearty, and it need not be very expensive. if it
is prepared the day beforehand it will prove a true holiday meal, for it will give a well-deserved rest to the cook--be she mistress
or maid. A dainty, substantial, and economical supper might consist of a salad, bread and butter, lettuce, cress or jelly
sandwiches, fruit, cakes, and tea, coffee, or chocolate. Bouillon in cups or grapefruit to begin with would make this supper more
festive and 'filling' and either could be added at a cost of 25 or 30 cents. The sandwiches, of course, would have to be put together
Christmas afternoon, but they could be planned the day beforehand. The fruit could be washed and dried and arranged in a dish--bananas, oranges, 
grapes, and apples are inexpensive and seasonable. The cakes could be made and put in the cake box. The grapefruit could be removed from its shell and put in a 
covered dish on the ice, ready to have sugar added and to be put in sherbet cups at the last minute, or the bouillon could be made, strained, 
and set aside--all the day beforehand."<br>

<p>
"'What shall we have for Christmas dinner?' that is a question that challenges every housewife as the holiday approaches. Certain things she
must have--or at least tradition says she must have-as fowl and cranberry sauce, and mince pie or Christmas pudding, and then there are the 
usual items, but not absolutely required by rule, as stuffing with the fowl, and rich giblet gravy and sweet and Irish potatoes, 
some kind of salad and fruit cake. It would seem from the foregoing list that Christmas dinner is pretty well prescribed, cut and 
dried, and requires no thought or planning on the part of the one who is to be responsible for it. This assumption, however, is far
from the truth. Greater choice is possible than seems so on the surface, and the feast may be a success or a failure in direct 
proportion to the wisdom with which it is planned....It is probably impossible to prevent a degree of overeating at Christmas dinner--
we are all 'big children' when it comes to that--but certain precautions may be taken. For instance, the mother of the family may
see to it the quality of food materials for her Christmas dinner is of the best, and she may see the big dinner is preceded by a
simple breakfast, including pure fruit juices and perhaps a cereal. Whole wheat grain cereal would be excellent, since it prepares
the system for the big dinner to come by regulating the eliminating organs and stimulating the system...Now for the Christmas dinner menu itself.
A little common sense here will be worth a deal of remedies later. Why not start with a clear soup? This prepares the stomach for the
heavy food, does not contribute much food value and helps in preventing overeating by filling the stomach with a light liquid at the start that 
stimulates the action of the digestive fluids. Chicken turkey or roast pig may follow, with potatoes, baked preferred to other
ways of cooking...of serving both sweet and white potatoes, a rather absurd custom, is never more out of place than at the heaviest
dinner of the year, so why not dispense with it? Creamed onions, squash and lettuce are important vegetables, full of important
minerals without being heavy; they can well have their place at our dinner...We probably will not be sensible enough--most of us
won't--to leave our plum pudding and our mince pie till the day after Christmas, when it would have twice the flavor, served with a light
main meal. Therefore let us at least remember to serve small portions, to let a little time elapse between these rich desserts and the
main meal, and to let them come as late in the meal as possible, after the fruit and nuts...Candy, if it is served, should be purchased
with great care, Let is be only what you know to be pure, fresh and well made. The final words of advice for the
successful Christmas dinner are: First, eliminate judiciously from the menu--don't overload it; second, have lenty of the lighter
vegetables that give bulk without heaviness; third, supply fruit juices; fourth, see that every bit of food is of the best. So we
will preserve our Christmas cheer, not only while the food is assailing our eyes and nostrils and is in our mouths, but twelve hours
adfterward."<br>

"While some of us will celebrate Christmas by gathering around a holly decked table laden with turkey, cranberry sauce and a flaming 
plum pudding, a very different sort of feast will ber enjoyed in those New York homes where families of European origin carry on their
native traditions. Those of Italian descent, for example, will sit down tonight to an eight or nine course dinner that in all 
probablility will last through to Christmas Day. One thing that characterizes most continental festivities, in fact, is the serving of the
chief Yuletide meal on Chrstmas Eve. Among the most important of the special foods that appear at the dinner is capitoni, which 
usually follows a broth. It consists of fried eels, of which Italians are especially fond. City markets are well stocked with the species, and, fortunately, the eels are more 
reasonably priced today that in times past, when they sold at auction for as much as $1 a pound. Brought in alive from Canada, Long
Island and the South, they're kept in tanks by dealers and sold alive, too. A special Christmas loaf called panettone, a cross between
bread and ckae, always finds its way at this season into Itlaian homes, where it provides a between meal refreshment, served with wine
or coffee. Made with a yeast dough, it contains raisins, citron, orange peel and nuts, and is flavored with anise. 
Zampieri Brothers, 17 Corniela Street, sells the loaf for 50 cents a pound, and it cane be found in most Italian neighborhood
 bakeries as well for about the same price. To get back to the meal, the next thing to appear on the table after the fish is capitelli, a 
noodle dough shaped like a cone and stuffed with chopped chicken and pork mixed with eggs and spices. Each cone stands about an inch high and 
a dressing of fruits, mustard and spices is served with it, or a tomato sauce. The main dish might be fowl, but more likely it's a
flank steak, rolled and stuffed with spinach, eggs and mozzarella cheese. A salad and melon come next, then the final sweet Cannoli, a righ pastry 
shaped like a cornucopia and filled with a custard cream mixed with candied fruits and pistachio nuts, is the traidional finale. Burgundy is the
favored wine to accompany the meal, and, of course, the table always holds a bowl of dried and fresh fruits and nuts.
<p>
"Though the foods served by the French vary on Christmas according to proinces, some families partaking of goose, others ham, one custom
common to all and followed by the French is the country is the serving of buche de noel for dessert. This is a  delicious and elaborate yule
log, made of cake--sometimes sponge, sometimes chocolate--and topped with a chocolate or mocha icing, garnished with green flowers.
The logs, prepared in varying sizes to suit the number of guests, are sold at the Patisserie Parisienne, 474 Sixth Avnue, near Eleventh Street, and at the 
Four Hundred Cake Shop, 1032 First Avenue, near Ffty-seventh Street. Prices average about 25 cents a serving, or a long large
enough to accomodate eight costs $2.
<p>
"Perhaps one of the most lavish of the holiday tables is enjoyed by Scandinavians, whose smorgasbord on Christmas Eve is 
piled high with relishes, fish salads, head cheeses and so on. But the tradtional lutfisk is the real specialty of the occasion.
It consists of a variety of fish, usually cod, that has been split down the center, cleaned, boned and put in the sun for a month 
or more to dry. Once the moisture is gone, the fish, looking like crinkly, stiff pieces of leather, may be kept indefinitely. Before it was sold, dealers soak it for
days in a solution of lime, water and soda to reconstitute it, and when the purchaser takes it home it has blown up six times its
weight when dried, is white, meaty and just like any fresh fish in appearance. This is the first Christmas in several years that
lutfisk from Norway has been on hand, that sold during the war having originated in Iceland. At Nyborg & Nelson, Swedish delicatessen at 
841 Third Avenue, near Fifty-first Street, both the Norwegian and Icelandic varieties are available for 40 cents a pound. The fish is
boiled or baked and served with a mustard sauce. Herring salad for the repast is also sold by that store at 75 cents a pound, but it is made on order only. 
Julgrot, a variation of rice pudding prepared with a few almonds, winds up the feast, and legend had it that the first unmarried person to find an 
almond will be the next bride or bridegrrom. As a beverage, julglogg, a potent brew made with brandy, port wine, spices, nuts and 
raisins and served hot, accompanies the meal. On Christmas Day the dinner features a roast pig, served with a bright red apple in 
its mouth, or a goose.
<p>
"Christmas Eve marks the beginning of festivities for Czechosloviakians, too, at which time the big evening meal, served on a 
candlelit table, features carp as the main dish. The fish is baked and overed with a well-spiced black sauce made with ginger snaps,
for which each household has its own recipe. Vanocka, a rich coffee cake filled with raisins and almonds and decoratively braided, is one of the most popular
of the traditional desserts. On Christmas Day, roast goose, the national dish, is served, and on the day after Christmas children go from
house to house singing carols to complete the three-day celebration."<br>

"If you're looking for a time-saving Christmas dinner menu, here it is. Roast turkey with favorite trimmings,...is traditional but quick to 
fix. It's also a suitable menu so serve buffet style which is another time-saving idea. For modern homemakers who are short on 
time, the turkey dinner offers a batch of quick tricks. Here they are: Buy a frozen stuffed bird. Leave it in the regfriterator todefrost for
24 hours before roasting time. Roast in slow oven , 325 degrees until done...Make gravy with condensed, canned soup and drippings. 
(Cream of mushroom, cream of celery or cream of chicken soup, right from the can, does wonders with turkey drippings. A few minutes of 
heating, a few turns of a wooden mixing spoon--and presto--creamy gravy with no lumps.) Use frozen or canned peas combined with canned
white onions (the tiny ones) and buts of chopped pimento for a colorful vegetable dish that's ready in 10 minutes. Whip up the
smoothest-ever mashed potatoes by using packaged, instant potatoes. Open a can of cranberry jelly and make individual salads. Serve
oysters on the half shell or shrimp cocktail for a first course. Have a tray of raw relishes--olives, pickles, carrot and celery
strips--ready and waiting in the refrigerator. Serve De Luxe Holiday cake for dessert made in advance."<br>

"For Americans wondering how to send goodies to US servicemembers, there are some very important 'don'ts' says Susan Templin, manager of the United States Department of 
Agriculture's Meat and Poultyr Hotline. Don't send anything made with pork products or alcohol because of Saudi government restrictions. Don't send anything perishable. Packages
take 14 to 20 days to get to Saudi Arabia...Consider items that can withstand the delay, high temperatures, and rough handling...Ms. Templin suggests store-bought cookies; cakes and breads that come
in tins or cans; jarred or canned nuts, pretzels, popcorn; beef jerky; dried fruit; hard candy; presweetened drink mixes (sugar-sweetened fare better than artificially 
sweetened mixes)...Homemade goods should be addressed to a specific servicemenber or unit. Nestle Foods Corporation is one company offereing 'desert-safe'
 recipes...Hershey Foods Corporation has come out with the coveted 'Desert Bar.' It was developed in response to the Army's request for a heat-resistant chocolate bar made with
real milk chocolate. Some 144,000 bars were shipped to Saudi Arabia. The 'Desert Bar' replaces the old 'Tropical Chocolate' bar...It has been tested at 120 degrees F. for 14
weeks. As far as morale enhancers go, perhaps nothing can top the troops' Christmas dinner: real turkey, gravy, shrimp, cranberry sauce, cornbread, instant potatoes, nuts,
sweet potatoes, fruit cake. Total cost: $3.1 million."<br>
