<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>What is pie?</b></font><br>
Pie is what happens when pastry meets filling. Pie can be closed, open, small, large, savory or sweet. 
The
basic concept of pies and <a href="foodpies.html#tarts"> tarts</a> has changed little throughout the ages.
Cooking methods (baked or
fried in ancient hearths, portable colonial/pioneer Dutch ovens, modern ovens), <a
href="foodpies.html#pastry">pastry
composition</a> (flat bread, flour/fat/water crusts, puff paste, milles feuilles), and cultural
preference
(pita, pizza, quiche, shepherd's, lemon meringue, classic apple, chocolate pudding). All figure
prominently into the complicated history of this particular genre of food. 
<p>The first pies were very simple and generally of the savory (meat and cheese) kind. Flaky
pastry fruit-filled turnovers appeared in the early 19th century. Some pie-type foods are made for
<a
href="foodpies.html#portable">individual consumption</a>. These portable pies... pasties, turnovers,
empanadas, pierogi, calzones...were enjoyed by working classes and sold by street vendors. Pie
variations (cobblers, slumps, grunts, etc.) are endless!
<p>
<b>How old is "pie?"</b><br>
The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> traces the first use of the word "pie" as it relates to
food to 1303, noting the word was well-known and popular by 1362.
<p>
<b>Why call it "pie?"</b><br>
"Pie...a word whose meaning has evolved in the course of many centuries and which varies to
some extent according to the country or even to region....The derivation of the word may be
from magpie, shortened to  pie. The explanation offered in favour or this is that the magpie
collects a variety of things, and that it was an essential feature of early pies that they contained a
variety of ingredients."<br>
---<i>The Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson, 2nd edition, Tom Jaine editor [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2006 (p.
603)
<p>
<a name="ancient">
<b>First pies</b><br>
Food historians confirm ancient people made pastry. Recipes, cooking techniques, meal presence and presentations varied according to culture and cuisine. In the 
cradles of civilization (Mediterranean region including Ancient Rome, Greece, Mesopotamia, Egypt and Arabia) the primary fat was olive oil. When combined with 
ground grains, it produced a rudimentary type of <a href="foodpies.html#pastry">pastry</a>. The challenging part of researching these early pies is most of us rely on translators of 
original texts. These can vary according to scholarly proficiency and educated interpretation. Moreover, there are several editions of ancient texts and recipe numbers/titles 
do not always match.
<p>
Food historians confirm the ancients crafted foods approximating pie. Modern pie, 
as we Americans know it today, descends from Medieval European ingredients (fat=suet, lard, butter) and technology (pie plates, freestanding pies, tiny tarts). 
<p>
"The idea of enclosing meat inside a sort of pastry made from flour and oil originated in ancient Rome, but it was the northern 
European use of lard and butter to make a pastry shell that could be rolled out and moulded that led to the advent of true pie." <br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 254) 
<p>
"If the basic concept of 'a pie' is taken to mean a mixture of ingredients encased and cooked in pastry, then proto-pies were made 
in the classical world and pies certainly figured in early Arab cookery. But those were flat affairs, since olive oil was used as 
the fat in the pastry and will not produce upstanding pies; pastry made with olive oil is 'weak' and readily slumps." <br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson, 2nd edition, Tom Jaine editor [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2006 (p. 603)

<b>Ancient Roman recipes</b><br> 
"[287] [Baked picnic] Ham [Pork Shoulder, fresh or cured] Pernam 
The hams should be braised with a good number of figs and some three laurel leaves; the skin is then pulled off and cut into square 
pieces; these are macerated with honey. Thereupon make dough crumbs of flour and oil. [1] Lay the dough over or around the ham, stud the top with 
the pieces of the skin so that they will be baked with the dough [bake slowly] and when done, retire from the oven and serve. [2]"<br> 
---Apicius, Book VII, IX, <i>Apicius: Cookery and Dining in Imperial Rome</i>, edited and translated by Joseph Dommers 
Vehling, facsimile 1936 edition [Dover Publications:Mineola NY] 1977 (p. 169) <br>
[NOTES (appended to this recipe: [1] Ordinary pie or pastry dough, or perhaps a preparation similar to streusel, unsweetened.<br> 
[2] Experimenting with this formula, we have adhered to the instructions as closely as possible, using regular pie dough to envelope 
the parboiled meat. The figs were retired from the sauce pan long before the meat was done and they were served around the ham as a 
garnish.] 
<p>
<b>Compare with this Latin text, English translation and modern instructions:</b><br> 
"Pernam, ubi eam cum caricis plurimis elixa veris et tribus lauri foliis, detracta cute tessellatim indicis et melle complebis. Deinde 
farinam oleo subactam contexes et ei corium reddis et cum farina cocta fuerit, eximas furno ut est et inferes." 
Boil the ham with a large number of dried figs and 3 bay leaves. Remove the skin and make diagonal incisions into the meat. Pour in 
honey. Then make a dough of oil and flour and wrap the ham in it. Take it out of the oven when the dough is cooked and serve. 
(Ap. 393)... 
<p>
"Cover the base of a pan, large enough to take the ham, with figs and lay the ham, stuffed with figs, on top. Fill the pan with water, 
and add 3 bay leaves. Cover, and boil the ham for 1 hour over a low heat. In the meantime make the pastry...When the ham is cooked, dry it well and 
make incisions all over the flesh. Baste it with honey while it cooks. Then wrap it in the dough and decorate it. Preheat the oven to 
200 C/400 F/Gas 6, and bake for 30 minutes until the crust is golden. leave to cool." (p. 268) 
"Pastry dough: Roman pastry dough was made with lard or olive oil rather than butter. Use double the weight of fat in flour. Spelt flour needs rather less 
fat than wheat flour. Rub the fat into the flour until it resembles breadcrumbs. Pour in a little salted water and press the 
crumbs into a ball. Leave in a cool place for several hours. Then roll it into a sheet on a marble surface dusted with flour, and use as the recipe 
requires." (p. 195) <br>

<b>Mesopotamia</b><br> 
"Mersu (Date and Pistachio Pastry). Mersu was a widely known pastry. Different inventories list different ingredients for 
mersu, so there were many recipes. mersu always seemed to contain first-quality dates and butter; beyond that, different records list 
pistachios, garlic, onion seed, and other seemingly incongruous ingredients. Bakers who specialized in this treat were known as the 
episat mersi, so mersu-making was probably an involved and respected process."

[NOTE: Modernized recipe follows (p. 31-32). Finished product wraps dough around filling, free form, not in a pie dish.]

<p>
<b>Medieval European pies</b><br>
There is some controversy whether the pastry crust used in Medieval times was meant for eating or as a cooking receptacle.
The answer is both. A careful examination of these early recipes reveals crust purpose. 
<p>
"Originally pies contained various assortments of meat and fish, and fruit pies do not appear until the late sixteenth century...pies
could be open as well as having a crust on top."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 254)
<p>
<b>American pies</b><br>
"As a favored dish of the English, pies were baked in America as soon as the early settlers set up
housekeeping on dry land. Beyond mere preference, howevers, there was a practical reason for
making pies, especially in the harsh and primitive conditions endured by the first colonists. A
piecrust used less flour than bread and did not require anything as complicated as a brick oven for
baking. More important, though, was how pies could stretch even the most meager provisions
into sustaining a few more hungry mouths...No one, least of all the early settlers, would probably
proclaim their early pies as masterpieces of culinary delight. The crusts were often heavy,
composed of some form of rough flour mixed with suet."<br>

<b>About pastry</b><br>
Food historians trace the genesis of pastry to ancient mediterranean paper-thin multi-layered <a
href="foodpies.html#bakalva">baklava and filo</a>. Returning crusaders introduced these
sweet recipes to Medieval Europe where they were quickly adopted. French and Italian
Renaissance chefs are credited for perfecting <a href="foodpies.html#puffpaste">puff pastry</a> and <a
href="foodpies.html#choux">choux</a>. 17th and 18th century chefs introduced
several new recipes, including <a href="foodbreads.html#brioche">brioche</a>, 
<a href="foodpies.html#napoleons">Napoleons</a>, <a
href="foodpies.html#creampuffs"> cream puffs and eclairs</a>. Antonin Careme (1784-1833) is said to
have elevated French pastry to art. In Central and Eastern Europe, strudels evolved. Sweet
yeast-breads and cakes share a parallel history. About <a
href="foodcakes.html#coffeecake">coffee cakes & galettes</a>.
<p>
"Small sweet cakes eaten by the ancient Egyptians may well have included types using pastry.
With their fine flour, oils, and honey they had the materials, and with their professional bakers
they had the skills. In the plays of Aristophenes (5th century BC) there are mentions of
sweetmeats including small pastries filled with fruit. Nothing is known of the actual pastry used,
but the Greeks certainly recognized the trade of pastry-cook as distinct from that of baker. The
Romans made a plain pastry of flour, oil, and water to cover meats and fowls which were baked,
thus keeping in the juices. (The covering was not meant to be eaten; it filled the role of what was
later called puff paste') A richer pastry, intended to be eaten, was used to make small pasties
containing eggs or little birds which were among the minor items served at banquets....In
Medieval Northern Europe the usual cooking fats were lard and butter, which--especially
lard--were conducive to making stiff pastry and permitted development of the solid, upright case
of the raised pie...No medieval cookery books give detailed instructions on how to make pastry;
they assume the necessary knowledge...Not all Medieval pastry was coarse. Small tarts would be
made with a rich pastry of fine white flour, butter, sugar, saffron, and other good things, certainly
meant to be eaten. From the middle of the 16th century on, actual recipes for pastry begin to
appear. ..The first recipe for something recognizable as puff pastry is in Dawson [The Good
Housewife's Jewell, London]...1596."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
586-7).
<p>
"Greek pistores had mastered the art of giving their bread the most extravagant forms, shaping it
like mushrooms, braids, crescents, and so on...thus illustrating in advance Careme's observation a
thousand years later: "The fine arts are five in number, namely: painting, sculpture, poetry, music
and architecture, the principal branch of the latter being pastry." And since it is not possible for us
to discuss flour without dealing with cakes, the moment has come to pose the question of what
pastry consisted of in antiquity, what it looked like and how it was made. The regrettable loss of
the great <i>Treatise on Baking</i>, by Chrysippus of Tyranus, which included detailed reicpes
for more than thirty cakes, each entirely different, leaves us somewhat short of information on this
important subject. But various cross-checks (not to mention the consulation of Apicius)
nonetheless give us a rather good idea of what the ancient Greeks and Romans confected in this
domain...the makers of Greco-Roman pastry had no knowledge of the subleties of dough, and
thus having nothing like our present-day babas, doughnuts, bioches, savarins, creampuffs,
millefeuille pastry, pastry made from raised dough or shortbreads...as a general rule, Greek pastry
closely resembled the sort that is still found today in North Africa, the Near East, and the Balkans:
the basic mixture was honey, oil, and flour, plus various aromatic substances, notably pepper. The
most frequent method of cooking was frying, but pastry was also cooked beneath coals. Other
ingredients included pine nuts, walnuts, dates, almonds, and poppy seeds. This mixture was
mainly baked in the form of thin round cakes and in the form doughnuts and fritters...Roman
pastry does not appear to have included many innovations over and above what the Greeks had
already invented."<br>

<b>Professional pastry guilds & chefs</b><br>
"Patissiere...Prehistoric man made sweet foods based on maple or birch syrup, wild honey, fruits,
and seeds. It is thought that the idea of cooking a cereal paste on a stone in the sun to make
pancakes began as far back in time as the Neolithic age...In the Middle Ages in France, the work
of bakers overlapped with that of the pastrycooks; bakers made gingerbread and meat, cheese,
and vegetable pies...However, it was the Crusaders who gave a decisive impetus to patisseries, by
discovering sugar cane and puff pastry in the East. This lead to pastrycooks, bakers, and
restauranteurs all claiming the same products as their own specialties, and various disputes arose
when one trade encroached upon the other...Another order, in 1440, gave the sole rights for meat,
fish, and cheese pies to patisseries, this being the first time that the word appeared. Their rights
and duties were also defined, and certain rules were established...In the 16th century, patissier
products were still quite different from the ones we know today. Choux pastry is said to have
been invented in 1540 by Popelini, Catherine de' Medici's chef, but the pastrycook's art only truly
began to develop in the 17th century and greatest innovator at the beginning of the 19th century
was indubitably [Antonin] Careme...There were about a hundred pastrycooks in Paris at the end
of the 18th century. In 1986 the count for the whole of France was over 40,000
baker-pastrycooks and 12,5000 pastrycooks."<br>
---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, Jenifer Harvey Lang, editor [Crown:New York] 1988 (p.
777-8)
<p>
"The bakers of France made cakes too until one day in 1440 when a specialist corporation, the
corporation of pastrycooks, deprived them of the right to do so. The pastrycooks had begun by
making pies--meat pies, fish pies...Romans had known how to make a kind flaky pastry sheet by
sheet, like modern filo pastry, but the new method of adding butter, folding and rolling meant that
the pastry would rise and form sheets as it did so. Louis XI's favourite marzipan turnovers were
made with flaky pastry...From the sixteenth century onwards convents made biscuits and
fritters to be sold in the aid of good works...Missionary nuns took their talents as pastrycooks to
the French colonies..."<br>

1992 (p.
242-244)
<p>

"Although the Paris pastry guild did not record its first constitution until 1440, there may well
have been pastry specialties before that date. Once their guild was recognized, they began to
expand the range of their production: in addition to meat pastries and tarts, they also created
pastries out of milk, eggs, and cream, usually sweetened, such as darioles, flans, and dauphins. In
order to become a master pastry maker in Le Mans in the early sixteenth century, one had to be
able to use sugar loaves to make hypocras, a sweet, spiced wine used as an aperitif and
after-dinner drink. It was not until 1566 that the king joined the Paris cookie makers guild to that
of the pastry makers, and the two would be wedded frequently thereafter."<br>

<b>Frozen pie crusts?</b><br>
Food historians laud Clarence Birdseye for launching the American frozen food industry. Fruits, veggies, fish
were first offerings. Other foods followed in swift progression. Swanson and Morton pioneered the frozen pie market; 
concentrating savory selections [Chicken, Turkey, Beef].
<p>
The earliest reference we find for frozen pie crust, as a stand-alone consumer retail product, appears in the mid-1950s. 
In 1955, a process for making frozen pie crust (rolled) was patented. This item was packaged in roll from; not as ready-to-bake
tinned shells. This USA <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=eEdmAAAAEBAJ&dq=2,726,156,"> 
patent</a>. was filed by Billie Hamilton Armstrong [TN] on June 4, 1954 and published December 6, 
1955.
<p>
Subsequent USA period ads do not describe frozen pie crusts. We have no way to know how the first frozen crusts were packaged: rolled
& destined for homemaker's own pie pans or pre-shelled "ready to fill" in disposable tins. In 1963 newspapers across America
heralded a "new" frozen pie crust sold in 9-inch tins; without referencing brand or company. The year before, two companies
rolled out new frozen pie crust products. Both were marketed to consumers in super markets. Pet-Ritz is generally credited for
introducing shelled frozen pie crust products to the American public. Oronoque Orchards [Stratford CT], a local farm stand
famous for its pies, may have actually eclipsed Pet-Ritz by a couple of months. Pet-Ritz took marketed their product nationally;
Oronoque Orchards remained local. By the mid-'60s, frozen pie shells were ubiquitous.

"Puncture-Free Pie Crust. Frozen pie crust has to be compounded carefully so as to resist tearing and puncturing between
the time it is rolled and the time the housewife spreads it in the baking tin. Billie Hamilton Armstrong of Hohenwald, Tenn., has
found a good proportion to be about two parts "soft" flour from summer-ripening wheat and one part "hard" flour from the winter
vareity. She divides the batch into pats of about one pound each and then subdivides these into smaller bits, rolling them by
hand to sheet form. This preliminary sheet is returned to pat form and rolled in a machine into pre-formed pie crusts about 
twelve to sixteen inches one-sixteenth of an inch thick. They got to the supermarket frozen, rolled in waxed paper and packed 
in light cardboard. Pie crusts prepared from dough made by her method, which is protected by Patent 2,726,156, "have uniformly
superiour characteristics," Mrs. Hamilton says, "combining the essential factors for exceptional flakiness and delactable
taste."<br>

"Pet-Ritz Pie Co. was started by the Petritz family. The family originally operated a roadside stand, selling cherry pies to Michigan

and freezing capabilities, Pet-Ritz Fruit Pies became one of the midwest's leading brands of frozen fruit pies...Because of
 consumer acceptance of frozen convenience products in the early 1960s, the Frozen Foods Division expanded into other product
areas. One frozen product that has been very successful is Pet-Ritz Pie Crust Shells. Pet's expertize in making pie crust for fruit

Both Pillsbury and Betty Crocker (General Mills) offered Pie Crust Sticks to the American public in the 1950s-1970s. 
These were 
natural iterations of pie crust baking mixes. The innovation factor was these sticks, packaged & wrapped like sticks of 
butter, only
required rolling.

<b>About puff paste</b><br>
Food historians generally agree puff paste was an invention of Renaissance cooks. It was a natural
iteration of shortcrust pastry. Early recipes were listed under various names. The term "puff
paste" became standard in early 17th century English cooking texts.
<p>
"Puff paste is thought to have been perfected by the brilliant pastry chefs to the court of the dukes
of Tuscany, perhaps in the fifteenth century. From there it made its was to the royal court of
France, most likely brought by Marie de Medici."<br>

<a name="piecrust">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Pie crust</b></font><br>
In its most basic definition, pie crust is a simple mix of flour and water. The addition of fat makes it pastry. In all times
and places, the grade of the ingredients depends upon the economic status of the cook. Apicius
[1st Century AD] makes reference to a simple recipe for crust (see below). Medieval cooking
texts typically  instruct the cook to lay his fruit or meat in a "coffin," no recipe provided. Up
through Medieval times, pie crust was often used as a cooking receptacle. It was vented with
holes and sometimes marked to distinguish the baker/owner. Whether or not the crust was consumed or discarded is 
debated by food historians. Some hypothesize the crust would have been rendered inedible due to extreme thickness and baking time.
Others observe flour, and by association flour-based products, was expensive and would not have been thrown away.
Possibly? Pies baked in grand Medieval houses served two classes: the wealthy at the contents and
 the crust was given to the servants or poor. Modern iterations include <a href="foodpies.html#frozenpiecrust">Frozen pie crust</a>
and <a href="foodpies.html#piecruststicks">Pie crust sticks</a>.

<p>
"Pies and tarts...In the Middle Ages, these sweet and savory preparations baked in a crust were
the specialty of patissiers--who had no other functions...We know that medieval cooks did not
always have ovens, and they worked with patissiers, to whom they sometimes brought fillings of
their own making for the patissier to place in a crust and bake. This explains why cookbooks
intended for professional chefs were nearly silent about the ingredients of these pastry wrappings,
but spoke only about consistency an thickness, and about the most suitable shapes...Still, medieval
cooks might take a chance and cook a simple pie or tart on their own by placing it in a shallow
pan, covered with a lid and surrounded by live embers, whose progress they had to monitor very
closely...In effect, the pastry because an oven, ensuring moderate heat thanks to its insulating
properties...So could it be that these pastry coverings were not necessarily eaten once they had
done their job of containing and protecting the fillings?"<br>
---<i>The Medieval Kitchen: Recipes from France and Italy</i>, Odile Redon et al, [University of
Chicago Press:Chicago] 1998 (p. 133-4)
<p>
Renaissance patissiers began experimenting with lighter, more malleable doughs. Recipes for short
paste ("short" in this case means butter) and <a href="foodpies.html#puffpaste">puff paste</a> enter
cookbooks at this time. 17th century English cook books and reveal several recipes for pie crust
and puff paste, all of varying thickness, taste and purpose. Robert May's <i>The Accomplisht
Cook</i> [1685] listed fourteen separate recipes for paste (pastry/pie crust/puff paste). American
cook books (<i>The Virginia Housewife</i>,
Mary Randoph [1828] & <i>Directions for Cookery in its Various Branches</i>, Miss Leslie
[1849]) contain instructions for making pies with puff paste, sometimes decorating them with cut
out pieces of this same paste. Mrs. Randolph's recipe for pumpkin pudding (<a
href="foodpies.html#pumpkinpie">pumpkin pie</a>) states
"put a paste around the edges and in the bottom of a shallow dish or plate, pour in the mixture,
cut some thin bits of paste, twist them and lay them
across the top and bake it nicely." (University of South Carolina Press:Columbia] 1984 ( p. 154). 
<i>Mrs. Porter's New Southern Cookery Book</i> [1879] reads: "Cranberry
tart...line your plates
with thin puff-paste, fill, lay strips of rich puff-paste across the top and bake in a moderate oven."
(p. 299). There is no illustration to show us exactly how these strips looked.
<p>
<b>In addition to being efficient cooking receptacles, covered pies promoted preservation:</b><p>
"The idea of the covered pie. The modern biscuit is a descendant of the barley bannock and the oatcake which have come down
to us from the beginning of civilization. It is a method of presering simply by reducing the water content of baked dough to such 
a degree that the product is not likely to be affected by mould; this is done, with the biscuit, in such a manner as to make chewing
easy. The biscuit is thus the result of a successful fight against the dangers threatening normally fermented baked goods, mould, and 
staleness. The basic idea of the covered pie is a similar one. The covered pie is of very old standing in the British Isles,
probably of longer standing than the modern biscuit. It has as a basis a similar dough to the biscuit, finely rolled out so
that it can be thoroughly baked like a crust, but not caramelized like a bread-crust. Such a crust, especially when some fat has
been added to the dough, is likely to withstand the influence of liquids and semi-liquids without becoming a sticky mess. If it is 
given an open pie-dish form, it can be used for filling with semi-liquids like minced meat or fruit, the whole thing is protected
by the outer layer of the crust against certain contaminates and can be kept for quite a long time."<br>
---(p. 184)
<p>
<b>Apicius' recipe:</b><p><blockquote>
<b>[287] [Baked Picnic] HAM [Pork Shoulder, fresh or cured] PERNAM</b><br>
The ham should be raised with a good number of figs and some three laurel leaves; the skin is then
pulled off and cut into square pieces; these are macerated with hone. Thereupon make dough
crumbs of flour and oil. Lay the dough over or around the ham, stud the top with the pieces of the
skin so that they will be baked with the dough and when done, retire from the oven and
serve."<br>

"The typical American pie made from uncooked apples, fat, sugar, and sweet spices mixed
together and baked inside a closed pie shell descends from fifteenth-century English apple pies,
which, while not quite the same, are similar enough that the relationship is unmistakable. By the
end of the sixteenth century in England, apple pies were being made that are virtually identical to
those made in America in the early twenty-first century. Apple pies came to America quite early.

<b>Why do some people serve cheddar cheese with apple pie?</b><br>
The practice of combining cheese, fruit, and nuts dates back to ancient times. These were often
served at
the end of a meal because they were thought to aid in digestion. From the earliest days through
the
Renaissance, the partaking of these foods was generally considered a priviledge of the wealthy.
This
practice was continued by wealthy dinners composed of many courses up until the 19th century.
Apples
and cheesemaking were introduced to the New World by European settlers. These people also
brought
with them their recipes and love for certain combinations. This explains the popular tradition of
apple pie
and cheddar cheese in our country.
<p>
"The dark ages...The main meal was taken around the middle of the day...In the evening a light
supper was
taken and this was always finished with a little hard cheese, for digestion's sake. Gradually the
large mid-day meal was later taken until that meal, wine-drinking and the cheese supper were
combined. Thus was
born the British habit of finishing an evening meal with cheese; almost every other society has
eaten cheese
before the sweet course to finish their main wine, or instead of a sweet."<br>

and eaten
with sugar, comfits, fennel seed or aniseed 'because of their ventosity.' Ordinary folk ate fruit as

they could get it. The poor people in Piers Plowman sought to poison hunger with baked
apples..."<br>

Ritz crackers, after a 10-year hiatus. The pie is made with cracker crumbs, water, sugar, lemon juice, cream of tartar, margarine

of the mock apple pie. Actually, the recipe is a lot older than Ritz crackers. Pioneer families crossing the Great Plains in the

<a name="baklava">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Baklava & filo</b></font><br>
The history and origin of baklava, a popular Middle Eastern pastry that is made of many sheets of
filo pastry laid flat in a pan and layered with sweet fillings, is commonly attributed to medieval
Turkey.
<p>
"Filo is the Greek name for a dough of many paper-thin layers separated by films of
butter...Although known to Europeans and North Americans by a Greek name, the dough is
clearly of Turkish origin. The medieval nomad Turks had an obsessive interest in making layered
bread, possibly in emulation of the thick oven breads of city people. As early as the 11th century,
a dictionary of Turkish dialects (Diwan Lughat al-Turk) recorded  pleated/folded bread as one
meaning of the word yuvgha, which is related to the word (yufka) which means a single sheet of
file in modern Turkish.
     This love of layering continues among the Turks of Central Asia...The idea of making the
sheets paper thins is a later development.The Azerbaijanis make the usual sort of baklava with 50
or so layers of filo, but they also make a...pastry called  Baki  pakhlavasi (Baku-style baklava)
using ordinary noodle paste instead of filo...This may represent the earliest form of baklava,
resulting form the Turkish nomads adapting their concept of layered bread--developed in the
absence of ovens...If this is so, baklava actually pre-dated filo, and the paper-thin pastry we know
today was probably an innovation of the Ottoman sultan's kitchens at Topkapi palace in Istanbul.
There is an established connection between the Topkapi kitchens and baklava; on the 15th of
Ramadan every year, the Janissary troops stationed in Istanbul used to march to the palace, where
every regiment was presented with two trays of baklava. They would...march back to their
barracks in what was known as the Baklava Procession."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
299)
<p>
"[Syrian] baklava are renowned thoughout the Near East. Some (called kol wa shkor) are made
with extremely thin layers of filo pastry and have different shapes. Others are made with a type of
 birds nest' pastry, shaped in cylinders, called borma...All are filled with a mixture of nuts (pine
nuts, hazelnuts, walnuts, pistachios can all be used), sugar, and rose or orange blossom water,
baked, and then coated with sugar syrup."<br>
---Oxford Companion to Food (p. 446)
<p>
"Persians, renowned patissiers since antiquity, invented the diamond-shaped Baklava which
contained a nut stuffing perfumed with jasmine or pussy willow blossoms. In the sixth century the
sweetmeat was introduced to the Byzantine court of Justinian I at Constantinople, where they
Greeks discovered phyllo (thin pastry) and adopted the dessert which they serve today on New
Year's and other joyous occasions."<br>

<a name="mudpie">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Mud pie</b></font><br>
There seems to be some controversy regarding the history of this particular dessert. Also
sometimes known as "Missisippi Mud Pie" and "Louisiana Mud Pie," food historians generally trace
Mud pie to the 1970s and when it hit mainstream restaurants. Most notably: The Chart House restaurant chain.
Print evidence confirms this recipe first surfaced in 1960s California. Noteriety grew in the 1970s and popularity exploded when
it became a "signature" dessert of the chocoholic 1980s. 
<p>
<b>What is Mud pie?</b><br>
Excellent question with no definative answer. This recipe invites experimentation. Early print descriptions suggest the
original dessert was a frozen fudge infused ice cream pie presented in chocolate cookie crumb pie crust. Ice cream flavors varied; 
fudge ran from chocolate sauce to thick emulsion. Some recipes incorporate marshmallow or whipped cream. 
Others have no ice cream at all and are served warm or room temperature. "Adult" versions are
laced with liqueur. Children's versions (think: <a href="foodpies.html#dirtcake">Dirt dessert & Dirt cake</a>) are a study in commercial
product assmeblage. They are classically garnished with gummy worms.
<p>
<b>When & where was Mud Pie invented?</b><br>
The earliest print reference we find for Mud Pie suggests it was concocted by the wife
 of a rising star chef based in Long Beach California, circa 1965. Early 1970s newspapers offer key references to Mud Pie recipes in 
readers' exhange columns and local fair contest winners. Clearly, the recipe was circulating locally among home bakers.
At some point in the early-mid 1970s, the Chart House restaurant chain added Mud Pie to its dessert menu. While we can't confirm this restaurant
"invented" mud pie, it certainly merits credit for elevating popularity to the national level. Upscale restaurants, foodservice operations,
corporate kitchens, and home cooks embraced the mud. With all sorts of interesting results. It is true that Mud Pie 
recipes come from Mississippi. It is equally true they come from the West, North, East and Midwest. MacArthur Park Mud Pie celebrates the mud in 
San Francisco Bay.

<p>
<b>Where did the idea come from?</b><br>
Likely culinary ancestors are Elizabethan-era Trifle (cream & cake), 19th century Viennese torten, 1900s double fudge brownies, 
1920s Black Bottom Pie, and 1950s novelty ice cream cakes.

<b>Dirt dessert</b><br>
Our survey of historicc USA magazines and newspapers suggest recipes called "dirt cake" & "Dirt dessert"
originated in the Midwest sometime in the 1980s. None of the articles we checked attribute this
recipe to a particular person or food company. Nor do they reveal the story behind the name. It is
plausable that "dirt cake" borrowed its moniker from another trendy rich chocolate dessert: <a href="foodpies.html#mudpie">Mud
pie</a>. Whatever the case, it was an immediate hit. Dirt cake
was served at class parties, Brownie meetings, birthday parties and the like. It didn't take long for
food companies to cash in on the deal. Dirt cake mixes were first marketed as packaged items in
the early 1990's.
<p>
The earliest mention we find of a recipe specifically called "Dirt Cake" was printed in the
<i>Arkansas Democrat-Gazette</i> [newspaper], June 15, 1988 in a recipe exchange column. This article
references a local reader who sent in a recipe for "Kansas Dirt Cake." The St. Louis Dispatch
wrote an article on the topic July 24, 1989, Food section (p. 2): "Tickle Fancy With Dirt Cake."
This article states "This recipe is apparently making the rounds of the area..." attesting to its
popularity at that time.

<a name="napoleons">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Napoleons</b></font><br>
The general concensus among the food history books is that napoleons, a popular flaky pastry
dessert, were not named for the famous emperor. The name is thought to be a corruption of the
word "Napolitain," referring to a pastry made in the tradition of Naples, Italy. The pastry used for
making napoleons is mille feuilles, literally meaning thousand leaves. While food historians place
the creation of this mille feuilles in 19th century Europe, it might possibly be a descendant of filo,
which was known to ancient middle eastern and Greek cooks. Filo is also composed of many
layers or leaves. One of the most famous filo recipes is <a href="foodpies.html#baklava">baklava</a>.
<p>
"Napoleons...have nothing to do with Bonaparte, the daring Corsican...The name is the result of a
misunderstanding of the French word <i>Napolitain</i> which should have been translated as
Neopolitan pertaining to Naples. They are very much like the French mille-fueille or the
Italian mille foglie both of which mean a thousand leaves."<br>
---<i>Rare Bits: Unusual Origins of Popular Recipes,</i> Patricial Bunning Stevens [Ohio
University Press:Athens] 1998 (p.202).
<p>
"Mille-Fueilles...The original cream-filled Mille-fueille or thousand leaf puff pastry was the
probably creation of Careme, who may have used it as a grosse piece d'entremets to adorn a
banquet table. It often goes by the name Napoleon, not out of respect for the corpulent corporal
but as a corruption of Napolitain, referring to the Neapolitan manner of making sweets and ices
in layers of alternating texture and color."<br>
---<i>The Horizon CookBook and Illustrated History of Eating and Drinking though the
Ages,</i> William Harlan Hale [American Heritage:New York] 1968 (p. 685).
<p>
"Napolitains are large cakes which, like Breton and Savoie cakes, mille-feuilles and croquembouche, were once used to decorate
elaborate buffets. In former times it was customary to place at each end of a table set for a large dinner party either and
imposing decorated pastry or a heap of crayfish of other shellfish. This practice has now been abandoned; and although napolitains
are still made, they are now usually small. The name of this cake suggests that it was created in Naples, but was this, in
fact, the case? Or must we, as would seem more probable, ascribe its invention to Careme, who, as is generally known, at the 
time when he was making great set pieces, invented a certain number of large and magnificent pastries to which he himself gave 
the names which they bear today? It is a question to which no certain answer can be given."<br>
---<i>Larousse Gastronomique,</i> Prosper Montagne, editor [Crown:New York] 1961 (p.653).
<p>
"Mille Feuilles, French for thousand leaves and a term for any of several items made from
several layers of puff pastry...The invention of the form (but not of the pastry itself) is usually
attribued to the Hungarian town of Szeged, and a caramel-coated mille feuilles is called
Szegedinertorte. Careme, writing at the end of the 18th century, cautiously states only that it was
of ancient origin...The most usual kind of mille fueilles is made of three layers of pastry baked in a
rectangle shape, sandwiched with a cream filling containing nuts, or or some other cream or
apricot jam, the top sprinkled with icing sugar...One particular oval type consisting of two layers
joined around the edge, containing the same almond filling as gateau Pithiviers and iced with the
same mixture diluted with egg white, is known in France as a "Napoleon'--probably a corruption
of "Napolitain', from the Neapolitan habit of making layered confections. In the USA the name
 Napoleon' may be applied to any mille feuilles, and it is usually to to all kinds with royal
icing."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
505)
<p>
According to the food historians, filo/phyllo is of Turkish origin. One of the
most popular foods made with this kind of dough is <a href="foodpies.html#baklava">Baklava</a>.
<p>
<b> The Careme connection?</b><br>
 Careme is generally regarded as the father of all modern French pastries. Ian Kelly's <i>Cooking for Kings: The Life of Antonin 
Careme, the First Celebrity Chef</i> includes a (modernized, translated) recipe for Gateau Pithvieir, attributed to Careme circa 1805 (p. 261). It is not so very 
different  from modern Napoleons. La Varenne's <i>French Cook</i> (we have the English version, circa 1653 published by Southover Press c. 2001) does not offer a 
recipe for Napolitains. It does, however offer several general instructions for pastry making (p. 192). It also offers recipes for two layered tortes: Tourte of 
Franchipanne (p. 200) and Tourte of Massepin [marzipan aka almond paste] (p. 201). It is interesting to note [but not necessarily connected] that Marie-Antoine Careme [1783-1833],
the famous french pastry chef  who managed Tallyrand's kitchens, was a contemporary of
Napoleon I [1769-1821].

<a name="bastilla">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Bastilla</b></font><br>

Bastilla (bastila, b'stila, bisteeya, pastilla), a savory bird pie associated with Morocco, descends from middle eastern culinary traditions. There is some controversy regarding the
 exact origins, as Morocco's gastronomic heritage is unique and complicated. Linguistic evidence supports the theory this type of pie circulated through Europe 
about the same time as the Crusades. <a href="foodmeats.html#pigeon">Pigeon</a> is generally considered the traditional protein. 
<p>
"Bstilla. Pronounced 'pastilla,' this is one of the Moroccan dishes said to have been brought back by the 'Moriscos'; from Andalusia after the Reconquista. 'Food of the 
Gods,' as it is described by the Moroccans, this magnificent pigeon pie is baked on special occasions...The pie is unusually enormous and must be baked in a gigantic
tray."<br>
---(p. 102-104)<br>
[NOTE: Recipe is included.]
<p>
"Composed of a flaky pastry dough called warka surrounding a filling of chicken or pigeon meat, butter almonds, lemony eggs, spices and sugar, bastilla, when 
properly made, is considered one of the great dishes of the world. It may come in as many versions as its name, which is printed variously as b'stilla, bastila, bastia, 
pastila, bisteyya, bistylao and pastella (the latter name found most often on menus designated for Americans). Bastilla is believed to have begin with a Berber dish 
called bestila that consisted of chicken cooked in butter and flavored with saffron. The first transformation occured with the initial wave of Arabs who, along with
 their sweords, brought to Morocco an early form of pastry caled trid--made by stretching dough over a hot surface. When trid was combined with the Berber
 dish of chicken and saffron the first bastilla was born. By the time the Arabs had launched their third wave they had perfected not only their invasion techniques but
 their pastry. As a result, the standard bastila was transformed by adding lemony eggs, sweetened almond layers, a variety of spices, onions, cinnamon and in some 
cases substituting piegeon for chicken meat...Bastila is said to have originated in the Medina in Fez."<br>
 ---"The Search for Morocco's Best Bastilla," Edith Marks, <i>New York Times</i>, May 22, 1983 (p. XX20)
<p>
"Bastila is a pigeon pie, a sumptuous, utterly rich, and magnificent preparation made for special occasions in Morocco such as holidays, weddings, or when 
esteemed guests arrive. The pie is surrounded by a very thin pastry leaf called warqa (which means 'leaf'), the top of which is sprinkled with powdered sugar and a
 latticework of ground cinnamon. Warqa pastry begins as a spongy dough that is tapped or slapped against a hot convex sheet of pounded metal, a kind of pan
 called tubsil set over a hot charcoal brazier, in a series of overlapping concentric circles to form a large film of pastry. This collection of leaves, now forming a
 whole thin sheet, is carefully but quickly peeled off the metal and set aside. Warqa pastry is a bit thinner than phyllo pastry...The name of the pigeon pie, bastila or 
bastal, comes from the Spanish word for pastry, pastilla, after the transformation of the phoneme 'p' into 'b' that is specific to the Arabic language...Contemporary
 Moroccan cuisine is essentially an Arab and Hispano-Muslim cuisine set upon the foundation of an older and simpler Berber sustenance diet, with outside
 influences from sub-Saharan West Africa and colonial-era France. The Arabs arrived in Morocco soon after the date of the Prophet Muhammad and continued
 on into Spain by the early eighth century. The Arabs and Muslimized Berbers in Spain merged with Hispano-Roman population then ruled by the Visigoths, a 
German military aristocracy, and they later came to be known by the historians as Hispano-Muslims and by popular writers as Moors. Between 1462 and 1615,
 this population emigrated to Morocco and other areas of North Africa as a result of the Christian Reconquest of Spain and governmental policies that led to the 
Great Expulsion of 1609-1614. ...[There is] some evidence of vestigial remain of the bastila or pastel around the Mediterranean. Perhaps the original Spanish dish 
migrated to Turkey with the Jews, as suggested in Claudia Roden's description of the dish called pasteles of the Turkish Jews. Patricia Smouha, the author of a 
Middle Eastern cookbook, also tells us of an 'old Syrian dish' called pastelis [sic], which is a pie stuffed with either fried beef, onions, and pine nuts or brains. In 
any case, we know that as late as the sixteenth century, Spain's King Philip II was still eating pastel. That pastelis traveled is not in doubt. Besides the evidence
 of the eastern Mediterranean, pastelis eventually appeared in Puerto Rican cookery stuffed with almonds, raisins, and cornmeal. There is another evidence of the
 Andalusian origins of and inspiration behind bastila. Andalusia had a rich court life under the Spanish branch of the Umayyad dynasty (756-1031), and the 
Almonhad (1130-1269) and Nasrid (1230-1492) caliphates and a concomitantly rich cuisine, whereas the Berbers did not. Pre-Islamic Berber cooking in 
Morocco was subsistence cooking, not cuisine. The French were making a kind of pie or cake called pastillys, a word that was transformed into gastellus, 
guastellus, wastellus, and gastiel--all names of different stuffed cakes that appear in texts from 1129 to 1200 in the areas of Champagne, Ile-de-France, 
and Picardie. It was a luxury pasty made with very fine, good-quality flour, and stuffed with meat or fish and spices and fat, corresponding to Moroccan bastila. 
The term crossed the English Channel, where the Scottish king William the Lion served wastelli dominici to Richard the Lion-Hearted. It also appears in yet a 
different guise in Sicily as guastedde or vastieddi, a kind of spleen calzone. It still appears today in Corsica as bestella, a meat-and-vegetable-filled pie pastry...
Bastila is a huge pigeon pie traditional in Fez, and found throughout Morocco. One Moroccan cookbooks starts a recipe for bastila by saying that one must have 
a dada come to the house to prepare it. A dada is a black professional woman cook from Saharan and sub-Saharan Africa employed in bourgeois and aristocratic
 households in Morocco to this day."<br>

"B'stila is widely regarded as the crowning dish of Moroccan cuisine. In Fez, the country's culinary capital, this delightful pastry is traditionally served to newlyweds
 the morning after their wedding night to symbolize their family's wish that their life together be as sweet as this sublime creation. The origin of b'stila remains a 
subject of debate among food historians. Some believe it was created by the Persians and adopted by their Arab neighbors, who popularized it during the 
conquest of North Africa. Other experts argue that credit fo the dish must go to the innovative cooks of Al Andus, the medieval Arabic name for Spain. 
Whatever its origin, today b'stila is firmly established as a quintessentially Moroccan specialty. B'stila was traditionally made with pigeon, although nowadays 
chicken is more commonly used. The meat is simmered in a sauce redolent of saffron, cinnamon, and ground ginger, then shredded and mixed with scrambled 
eggs, ground almonds, and powdered sugar to form an exquisite filling that is layered between sheets of paper-thin phyllolike dough called ouarka. A golden b'stila, 
just out of the oven, garnished with powdered sugar and decorated with cinnamon, never fails to elicit appreciative exclamations from around the table. A
 solicitous Moroccan host will quickly poke several holes in the flaky outer crust to allow some of the trapped fragrant steam to escape. He invokes be blessing
 'Bismillah!' before deftly breaking off a tasty morsel and offering it to one of his honored guests....B'stila calls for a paper-thin pastry dough called ouarka, whose
 preparation is an art requiring considerable experience. In Morocco, it is mainly the domain of the dadas, women descended from Sudanese slaves. They are
 reputed for their skill at creating the translucent round leaves. These ouarka specialists sit by the hour in front of a small charcoal fire, dexterously dabbing a ball 
of moist, slippery dough on the hot tin-plated outside surface of a round copper pan (much like a modern upside-down crepe griddle) called a tabsil dial ouarka 
that rests just above the glowing coals. The tabsil is evenly covered with overlapping circles of dough. Within a minute, a leaf of transluscent ouarka as thin as onion
 skin is deftly peeled from the pan. Most modern Moroccan housewives purchase ready-made ouarka at their local market. Phyllo dough makes and excellent 
subsistute for ouarka."<br>

Food historians tell us <a href="foodpies.html#chocolate">chocolate pie</a>, as we know it today, was 
introduced in the last decades of the 19th century. The earliest versions were topped with meringue or a thin layer of 
whipped cream, creating a "black bottom" of sorts. Early prototypes were baked in standard pastry shells and served room 
temperature. <p>
Recipes titled "Black Bottom" surface in early 20th century. They were hailed as 'novel' in the 1920s. 
Modern chilled versions coincide with the introduction of "icebox" (aka refrigerator) desserts. These new desserts typically 
incorporated commercially prepared items. In the case of pie, standard pastry shells were replaced by 
crushed cookie or graham cracker crusts. As time progressed, ratio of chocolate filling to white topping flipped. 
Some versions introduce a layer in between.

Food historians generally associate "Black Bottom Pie" with Southern USA cuisine. Our research confirms this is true, but not 
in the place most folks expect. Latitude-wise. Our survey of historic USA newspapers suggest "Black Bottom Pie" 
originated in southern California (Los Angeles). Variations slowly rolled eastward (via Oklahoma, Texas, 
Kentucky, Florida) to the Atlantic shore where they were embraced without question. None of our Southern cookbooks 
published in 1930s contain "Black Bottom" recipes. 
<p>
<b>This is what the food historians say: </b><br>
"'I think this is the most delicious pie I have ever eaten,' exclaimed Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings in her 1942 kitchen narrative, <i>Cross 
Creek Cookery</i>...Duncan Hines, the wandering hotel and restaurant scout from Kentucky, published an almost identical black bottom pie in his 
<i>Adventures 
in Good Cooking</i> in the early 1940s, having found the dessert in a restaurant in Oklahoma City, but it isn't clear whether his discovery 
receded Mrs. Rawlings' or drew its inspiration from hers. James Beard, in his American Cookery, said black bottom pie 'began appearing in 
cookbooks around the turn of the century,' but he cited none; it wasn't in Fannie Farmer's magnum opus or Joy of Cooking until after Rawlings 
and Hines published it. But the story of its origin has been lost, the basic formula for its unique combinations 
of flavors is safe--and certain to remain with us. Let it suffice to say that black bottom is a Southern pie that has been 
spreading joy in and out of the region for close to fifty years or more." <br>
---<i>Southern Food</i>, John Egerton [University of North Carolina Press:Chapel Hill] 1993 (p. 328-329) 
<p>
"Certain recipes are destined to catch the public fancy and become classics, 
though not necessarily right away. One such recipe is Black Bottom Pie...appears not to have caught on, however, until 
the late 1930s when Duncan Hines, author of America's trusted Adventures in 
Good Eating, made note of it...Later Hines would recall Black Bottom Pie as "one of 
those marvelous creations that has somehow managed to keep its light under a 
bushel." In 1940 <i>The Good Housekeeping Cook Book</i> and <i>Woman's Home 
Companion Cook Book</i> both printed recipes for Black Bottom Pie...One of Black 
Bottom Pie's biggest fans was Floridian Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, author of the 
Yearling, who included her version of Black Bottom Pie in her Cross Creek 
Cookery (1942)." <br>

<p>
<a href="foodpies.html#pieking">Monroe Boston Strause</a> "The Pie King" included an entire chapter on Black Bottom Pie in his classic 
book <i>Pie Marches On</i>. He prefaced the recipe with these headnotes: "This is without doubt the most sensational pie 
that has ever been introduced, and is one of the outstanding originals of the writer. Aside from being a sensation, I
 believe it brought the highest price that any pie ever sold at commercially; $1.90 for a nine inch pie retail, and the 
volume in which it sold made pie history. This pie was written up by newspapers and magazines all over the country, and 
on these pages the recipe is published for the first time. Those who were among the fortunate few to obtain this recipe
 guarded it very closely, and it is my prediction that it will be the outstanding pie in this book. The sensation was not
 in the pie alone, but in its design and make-up, as well as the crust beneath it. On this pie was first introduced the
 Graham Cracker Crust and, of course, we will start with the crust."<br>---<i>Pie Marches On</i>, Monroe Boston Strause 
[Ahrens Publishing:New York], 2nd edition 1951 (p. 231) [NOTES: (1) Recipe included; happy to scan or fax. (2) Mr. Strause is credited for inventing 
<a href="foodpies.html">Chiffon Pie</a> 
 (3) We cannot absolutely confirm this recipe appeared in the original 1939 edition] 
Monroe Strause appears to be claiming to be the inventor of Black Bottom Pie. He was from Los Angeles. The earliest 
recipes we find titled "Black Bottom Pie" were published in California Newspapers. Coincidence? Maybe not.

"Black Bottom Pie. </b><br>
I think this is the most delicious pie I have ever eaten. The recipe form which I first made it was sent me by a generous correspondent, 
and originated at an old hotel in Louisiana. It seemed to me it could be no better. Then another correspondent sent me a recipe 
for Black Bottom Pie that varied in some details from the first one. Having tried both, I now combine the two to make a pie so 
delicate, so luscious, that I hope to be propped up on my dying bed and fed a generous portion. The I think that I should refuse 
outright to die, for life would be too good to relinquish. The pie seems fussy to make, but once a cook gets the hang of it, it goes 
easily. <br>
<b>Crust </b><br>
14 crisp ginger cookies <br>
5 tablespoons melted butter <br>
Roll the cookies fine. Mix with the melted butter. Line a nine-inch pie tin, sides and bottom, with the buttered crumbs, pressing 
flat and firm. Bake ten minutes in a slow oven to set. <br>
<b>Basic Filling </b><br>
1 3/4 cups milk <br>
1 tablespoon cornstarch <br>
4 tablespoon gelatine <br>
1/2 cup sugar <br>
4 egg yolks <br>
Pinch of salt <br>
<b>For Chocolate Layer</b> <br>
2 squares melted chocolate <br>
1 teaspoon vanilla <br>
<b>For Rum-Flavored Layer </b><br>
4 egg whites <br>
1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar <br>
1/2 cup sugar <br>
1 tablespoon rum <br>
<b>Topping </b><br>
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar <br>
1 cup whipping cream <br>
Grated chocolate <br>
Soak the gelatine in the cold water. Scald the nilk, add one-half cup sugar mixed with the cornstarch, pinch of salt, then beaten egg yolks. 
Cook in double boiler, stirring constantly, until custard thickens and will coat the back of the spoon. Stir in the dissolved 
gelatine. Divide custard in half. To one-half add the melted chocolate and the vanilla. Turn while hot into the cooled crust, dipping 
out carefully so as not to disturb the crust. Let the remaining half of the custard cool. Beat the egg whites and cream of tartar, 
adding one-half cup of sugar slowly. Blend with the cooled custard. Add one tablespoon rum. Spread carefully over the chocolate 
layer. Place in ice box to chill thoroughly. It may even stand over-night. When ready to serve, whip the heavy cream stiff, adding 
two tablespoons confectioners' sugar slowly. Pile over the top of the pie. Sprinkle with grated bitter or semi-sweet chocolate." <br>

both in America and abroad. If you want to inspect these recipes ask your librarian can help you

"Boston cream pie was invented by Monsieur Sanzian, a French pastry chef hired in 1855 by the
former Parker House (now the Omni Parker House). Executive chef Joseph Ribas, who has been
with the hotel for 27 years, says Sanzian invented it "because he was topping an English cream
cake with chocolate. He started to play around with the recipe, put almonds around the outside,
and the guests loved it...
According to research conducted by Stephanie Seacord, former director of public relations for the
Omni Parker House, the original Boston cream pie had only two layers. Ribas's version, however,
consists of three layers of spongecake, which are soaked with rum syrup, spread with
whipped-cream-lightened custard, topped with chocolate and vanilla icing, and garnished with
toasted sliced almonds. This recipe makes 4 cups of custard filling, a fine amount if you're going
to cut the cake into three layers. If you plan to cut the cake into two layers, however, I
recommend making a half portion of the pastry cream. <p>
<b>For the pastry cream:</b> <br>
1 tablespoon butter <br>
2 cups milk <br>
2 cups light cream <br>
1/2 cup sugar <br>
3 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch <br>
6 eggs <br>
1 teaspoon dark rum <p>
<b>For the chocolate fondant icing: </b><br>
2 cups sugar <br>
1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar <br>
1 cup water <br>
3 ounces semisweet chocolate <br>
1/2 cup sliced almonds <p>
<b>For the cake: </b><br>
7 eggs <br>
1 cup sugar <br>
1 cup flour <br>
2 tablespoons butter, melted <br>
To make the pastry cream, combine the butter, milk, and light cream in a medium saucepan over
medium-high heat. Bring just to a boil. In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar and
cornstarch. Add the eggs and beat until ribbons form, about 5 minutes. Whisk into the hot-milk
mixture and bring to a boil, whisking constantly (to prevent the eggs from scrambling) until the
mixture has thickened, about 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl and cover the surface with plastic wrap
(to keep a skin from forming). Refrigerate for several hours. Whisk in the rum. 
<p>
To make the chocolate fondant icing, wipe a large cookie sheet (or marble slab) with a damp
cloth.  Combine the sugar, cream of tartar, and water in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.
Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Cover and let boil
for 3 minutes. Uncover and dip a pastry brush in cold water to wash down the sides of the pot;
boil until the syrup reaches the soft-ball stage (238 degrees), about 5 minutes. Remove from the
heat and pour onto the damp cookie sheet. Let it cool for 10 minutes, or until lukewarm. 
<p>
Using a metal spatula, spread the sugar mixture out and turn it over on itself until it starts to
thicken and whiten. (It may be easier to knead the mixture with your hands.)
Continue kneading the sugar mixture until it is very stiff. Scrape it off the sheet, place in an
airtight container, and refrigerate for several hours.  To make the cake, preheat the oven to 350
degrees. Lightly grease a 10-inch springform pan. Separate the eggs, putting the whites in one
medium bowl and the yolks in another. Add 1/2 cup of sugar to each bowl. Beat the egg whites
until they form stiff peaks; beat the egg yolks until they are thick and pale yellow in color, about 5
minutes. Gently fold the stiff egg white mixture into the yolk mixture. 
<p>
Gradually fold in the flour and then fold in the melted butter. Pour the batter into the prepared
cake pan and bake for 18 to 20 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out
clean when inserted into the center of the cake. Let cool. To assemble, heat 3/4 cup of the fondant
and the chocolate in a double boiler until warm. Stir to a spreading consistency, adding a little
water as necessary. Using a long serrated knife, slice the cake into 2 layers. Spread the pastry
cream over the bottom layer, reserving approximately 1 cup of pastry cream to spread around the
sides of the cake (to help the almonds adhere). Place the second layer of cake over the pastry
cream and spread the reserved pastry cream around the sides of the cake. Top with the chocolate
icing (work rapidly, since the icing sets very quickly) and press the almonds around the sides.
Serve immediately at room temperature, or refrigerate for up to 2 days and bring to room
temperature before serving. (When refrigerated, the fudgelike icing becomes quite heavy and
stiff.)  Serves 10. <br>

"Cannolo (or cannoli, the plural form more familiar in N. America), a Sicilian sweetmeat made from flour, mixed with Marsala, 
cinnamon, cocoa, egg, and a mixture of water and vinegar (which is said to keep it crisp). The thinly rolled dough, cut in circles, 
is wrapped around metal tubes and deep fried. When cool, the connolo is filled with sweetened ricotta, chocolate chips, 
and candied orange peel, or liqueur-flavoured ricotta in which case the ends are dipped in chocolate nuts. These cakes are 
made for carnival, in February." <br>

"Cannoli...The convents of Sicily are the great repositories of Arab-influenced desserts, the so-called dolci de badia, or 
abbey sweets...sweets from the Convento di Santa Caterina on Piazza Bellini in Palermo, where they make cannoli... 
The great Sicilian gastronome...Alberto Denti di Pirajno proposed a theory as to how the convents became home for so many 
Arab-influenced sweets. During Arab rule in Sicily (827-1091), the inland town of Caltanissetta was called 
Qal'at al-nissa, the castle of women, because of the fame of the harem of the emir of that city. In the hours when they 
awaited their masters, the women prepared sweets and cakes. After the Normans conquered Caltanissettta, the harems 
disappeared by the Muslims did not. They were driven into the mountains, and some converted--perhaps the women found 
refuge as crypto-Muslim nuns in the convents, bringing their secret recipes...to be handed down through the confines 
of the convents." <br>

"...the king of Carnival is the cannolo, which in its plural form, cannoli, is now part of the American language...To be 
good, cannoli have to be very fresh (the best coffee houses and bars in Palermo offer cannoli espress--filled while you 
wait), so if you are a cannoli fan and you can get good ricotta, it is worth the effort to make them at home." <br>

<b>About ricotta</b><br>
"Ricotta is an Italian cottage cheese made originally from the whey left after making other cheeses--from 
cow's, ewe's, or even goat's milk--but nowadays often with full or skimmed milk added. It is widely used in 
Italian cookery: applications include fillings for ravioli and cannelloni, cheesecakes, and ice cream. Its 
name means literally 'recooked', from the method of manufacture; it goes back to Latin recocta, feminine 
past participle of recoquere, cook again.'" <br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 282) 
<p>
"Ricotta is known as an albumin or serum cheese, a cheese made as a by-product of provolone cheese 
from the recooked whey, hence the name, ricotta, "recooked." Ricotta cheese, which is generally 
recognized as having been invented in Sicily, is known in the language of the island by another name: 
zammataru, a word in Sicilian meaning "dairy farmer." This word is derived form the Arabic za'ama, 
meaning "cow," leading to the supposition that ricotta might have had its origins in the Arab-Sicilian era. 
The Greek antiquarian who wrote volumes on food, Atheneus (c. A.D. 170-230), talks about "tender 
cheese" at a banquet. We don't know if this is ricotta, but he also mentions a cheese from Sicily that was 
well known. Two of the earliest mentions or depictions of ricotta are related to Sicily. Professor Santi 
Correnti, chairman of the history department of the University of Catania and a preeminent historian of 
Sicily, told me that during the reign of the Sicilian king Frederick II, in the early thirteenth century, the king, 
and his hunting party came across the hut of a dairy farmer making ricotta and, being ravenous, asked for 
some. Frederic pulled out his bread loaf, poured the hot ricotta and when you top, and advised his retinue 
that "Cu; non manica ccu' so' cucchiaru lassa tutto o zammatary" (Those who don't eat with a spoon will 
leave all their ricotta behind). The first depiction of the making of ricotta is an illustration in the medical 
treatise known as the Tacuinum sanitas (medieval health handbook), the Latin translation of Ibn Butlan's 
eleventh-century Taqwim al-sihha." <br>
---<i>A Mediterranean Feast</i>, Clifford A. Wright [William Morrow:New York] 1999 (p. 467) 
<p>
"Salted ricotta belongs to all the summer; from October to May ricotta is eaten fresh, both as a cheese and 
as the basis of Sicilian confectionery. We have already met sweetened ricotta mixed with cuccia, and 
while the renowned cannoli and the cassate siciliane with their ricotta cream fillings belong not to the 
classical but to a later period in Sicilan history, this is the place for a recipe that uses sugar and ricotta in a 
different fashion." <br>

Chess pie (also known as chess cake, chess tart, & sugar pie) belongs to a long Southern
American
tradition of 
sweet egg-rich custard pies. Popular culinary folklore offers several interesting explanations for
the name of
this recipe. The most plausible is the connection between it and 17th century English  cheeseless
cheesecakes.  Foodways expert Karen Hess confirms: <br>
<blockquote>"Since the archaic spellings of cheese often had but one "e"  we have the answer to
the riddle
of the name of that southern favorite "Chess Pie," recipes for which vary no more from that for
"Transparent
Pudding" than those do among themselves; "Chess Cake: is also akin, if less directly. (The
tradition of
making cheesecake without the cheese goes back to early seventeenth century and
beyond...)"<br>

"The Southern chess pie carries and old--even ancient--tradition of puddings and pastries with the
rich
texture of cheese. "Chess" is probably derived from the word "cheese," although various other
theories
have arisen about the origin of the name. Elizabeth Hedgecock Sparks, author of<i> North
Carolina and
Old Salem Cookery</i>, says it is "an old, old tart which may have obtained its name from the
town of
Chester, England." Others believe that "chess" is a corruption of the world "chest" (as in a pie
chest) where
pies are often kept. Then there is the story about the cook who was asked what she put in the pie,
and she
replied, "Anything in our chest." Or the one who was asked about the kind of pie. The answer
was "Oh, jes'
pie." 
     The cheese etymology seems the most likely one, because in old cookbooks, cheesecakes and
pies
that were sometimes made with cheese sometimes without (referring to cheese in the textural
sense--lemon card, for example, is often referred to as lemon cheese), are often included in a
single category. A
selection of cheeseless "cheese" pastries in <i>Housekeeping in Old Virginia</i> (1879) are made
with egg
yolks, sugar, butter, milk, and lemon juice--very much like chess pie filling. Sometimes called
"Cheesecake
Pudding" (the filling is made of yolks, brown sugar, butter, nutmeg, and brandy or rum) is baked
in a crust in
small tins..."<br>

367-8)<br>
[NOTE: this author observes "sugar pies" were chess pies made with white sugar, "brown sugar
pies" were the same recipe made with brown sugar and "Osgood" pies included raisins.]
<p>
"Chess pie is the classic Southern pastry, rich, sweet, and intense. The name is a corruption of
cheese, for
in the British culinary tradition eggs and cheese share the same terminology...The Oxford English
Dictionary
says a cheesecake is "a cake or tart of light pastry, orginally containing cheese; now filled with a
yellow
butterlike compound of milk-curds, sugar, and butter, or a preparation of whipped egg and
sugar." The
Southern version is the latter...The classic chess pie is pointed up with vanilla and/or nutmeg.
Lemon chess,
perhaps the favorite, receive just enough citrus flavor to name, but not dominate, the
custard...Variations on
the chess theme are Brown Sugar Pie, and with nuts, Pecan Pie."<br>

<b>What is chiffon?</b><br>
"A chiffon pie is a light fluffy confection in which flavoring, usually in an egg-yolk base, is supported by stiffly beaten egg
whites and/or whipped heavy cream. Often gelatin is added as well, as a stabilizer. Without gelatin, the chiffon is essentially a 
bousse, a French term meaning, literally, 'froth,' or 'foam.'...When gelatin is added to the egg yolk base along with whipped
cream, it becomes, strictly speaking, a Bavarian cream."<br>
---<i>The Perfect Pie</i>, Susan G. Purdy [Broadway Books:New York] 2000 (p. 290)
<p>
"Chiffon. A very light, sweet fluffy filling for a pie, cake, or pudding. The word is from the French, meaning "rag," and ultimately the Middle English word for "chip," 
as chiffon also refers to pieces of sheer, delicate ribbon or fabric for women's clothing. Chiffon pie is first mentioned in American print in 1929 as a "chiffon pumpkin
 pie," in the <i>Beverly Hills Women's Club's Fashions in Food</i>. The 1931 edition of Irma S. Rombauer's <i>Joy of Cooking</i> gave a recipe for lemon chiffon."<br>

<p>
"Chiffon Pie. My research tells me that these fluffy unbaked pies debuted in the early 1920s as "souffle" or "gelatin" pies. A headnote to the Eggnog Chiffon Pie
 recipe in <i>Woman's Day Old Fashioned Desserts</i> (1978) says that "Chiffon pies were invented in 1921 by a professional baker who lived in Iowa. By 
beating egg whites with a fruit-flavored syrup until the mixture was light and fluffy, he achieved a filling that his mother said looked like a pie of "chiffon." It's a story
 I've been unable to substantiate. Besides, Knox Gelatine's 1915 booklet, <i>Dainty Desserts for Dainty People</i>, features gelatin "sponges," "marshmallow
 puddings," and "marshmallow creams"--the airy mixes that would one day emerge as chiffon fillings...Searches of several dozen early-twentieth-century cookbooks 
turn up a few "souffle" and "sponge" pies, but these contained no gelatin and/or whipped cream. They were baked pies with stiffly beaten egg whites folded in just
 before they went into the oven...The earliest fluffy gelatin pies that I was able to locate both appeared in <i>Good Housekeeping's Book of Menus, Recipes and 
Household Discoveries</i>. The date: 1922. The first, Coffee Souffle Pie, qualifies on all counts as a chiffon pie...The second Good Housekeeping recipe, 
Pineapple Gelatin Pie, contains gelatin and heavy cream...but no egg whites. Still, it is very chiffonlike. Leafing through 1930s cookbooks, I find four chiffon pies in
 <i>My Better Homes & Gardens Cook Book</i> (1939); lemon, chocolate, pineapple, and pumpkin. All begin with a gelatin "custard," are fluffed with stiffly 
peaking egg whites, and, in the case of the pineapple, with whipped cream as well. Here too, the crusts are the standard pastry, baked and cooled (crumb-crusted 
chiffon pies come later--with pies such as grasshopper...and Black Bottom..). Two 1940 cookbooks featured a great variety of chiffon pies: <i>Women's Home 
Companion Cook Book</i> (with nineteen) and the <i>Good Housekeeping Cook Book</i> (with thirteen). Despite World War II sugar shortages, chiffon pies 
surged into popularity during '40s, driven perhaps by <i>The Joy of Cooking</i>, which devoted a special section to them. Chiffon pies remained popular right 
through the '70s. Then in the 1980s when salmonella began compromising the wholesomeness of our eggs, they fell from favor. But only briefly. Savvy food
 manufacturers discovered that powdered egg whites, cream cheese, whipped toppings, and marshmallow cream could double nicely for raw egg whites. Thus,
 '90s chiffon pies are likely to contain no eggs at all. And sometimes no gelatin. There's usually no stinting, however, on whipped cream."<br>

"Lemon Chiffon Filling</b><br>
First place on the stove and bring to a boil:<br>
1 quart water<br>
12 oz. sugar<br>
1/4 oz. salt<br>
3/4 oz. grated lemon rind<br>
2 or 3 drops lemon color<br>
Bring this to a boil and thicken with 5 ounces of cornstarch dissolved in 6 ounces of fresh lemon juice. After the cornstarch
solution has been added, cook until thick. Next place in the cake machine 1 pint of egg whites and 1/2 pound of sugar and beat dry stiff. Then 
add an additional half pound of sugar to the beaten egg whites and continue beating the whites until this last part of the sugar
is thoroughly dissolved. This will only take a few revolutions of the machine. Remove the beaten egg whites from the cake machine
bowl and place them in a round-bottom mixing bowl. The pour the cooked part over the beaten egg whites and with a wire-hand whip
fold together easily but well. The filling whould be placed in the shell immediately. Do not allow to stand. Fill the shell 
generously full and with a spatula pyramid to the center of the pie, making the center higher than the sides. Allow to cool and
top with whipped cream. It is very important that the cooked portion of the mix be thickened after the egg whites have been
properly beaten, and they must then be folded together immedatiely. If the cooked portion of the mix is allowed to stand waiting for the 
egg whites to attain the proper stiffness, a skin will form, and on folding this mix into the egg whites, a lumpy filling will
result. Smoothness and texture are important to the successful chiffon pie. Soft or underbeaten egg whites will cause the pie to be
soft and runny, and the definition of 'dry stiff' in this case means beating the egg whites beyond any stiffness that you would consider
using for a meringue."<br>

<b>Who was Monroe Boston Strause, "The Pie King?"</b><br>
"Monroe Boston Strause, pie engineer. Here is the man who invented chiffon pie--and his recipe...Fruit-fragrant chiffon will be the 
pie star on the menus of tomorrow, is the prediction of Monroe Boston Strause, number-one pie engineer of the nation. And pie man
Strause ought to know: Commercial bakers in 48 states look to him as style leader in the building of America's favorite
dessert. Monroe Boston Strause has a weakness for that pie called chiffon; it's an invention all his own. But chiffon pies postwar
will have a different kind of thickening from those of today. Cornstarch is being outmoded by new gelatinizing agents, tasteless,
clear as glass, that can be combined with the filling without beating. Fresh fruit chiffons will taste like fresh fruit. It was in 
1921 that ambitious, redheaded Monroe Strause, 16, went into the business with an uncle who fancied himself a pie baker. Cream
pies were Uncle Mike's specialty--stiff with cornstarch. Monroe couldn't bear the sight of them, let alone promote their
sale...Determined to make his first business venture succeed, the youngster began fooling around with pie fillings. He started with 
a recipe for the French cream used in eclairs in which boiled sugar syrup is added to beaten egg whites, then the cornstarch
filling folded into this. Anything for lightness, so Monroe began piling in the egg whites. First thing he knew  he had a filling
ethereal. This creation he carried home to show off to his mother. 'Why, it looks just like a pile of chiffon,' she said. 
So the pie was christened. Mere piecrust seemed unworthy support for such a delicate dainty. Monroe's mother suggested graham crackers
for a shell. Then crumb crusts were unknown. More experimentation. Eventually a shell light, crisp, tender--the ideal mate for chiffon.
Monroe's first chiffon pies sold as a restaurant novelty, 35 cents a thin wedge. Within three years he boasted the largest pie
business in the West. Bakers from everywhere were asking, 'How did you do it?' Monroe sold his pie company to be a pie
engineer. Anyone, he claims, can turn out a chiffon nothing short of perfection by following his blueprint directions."<br>

<a name="cobbler">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Cobbler</b></font><br>
Cobbler is an amalgam of European tradition and American ingenuity.  According to the food
historians, cobbler (peach, apple, plum, cherrry, etc.) originated in the American West during the
second half of the 19th century. It was a deep-dish thick, quick crust filled with whatever
fruit (fresh, canned, dried) was on hand. Necessity required westward-bound pioneer cooks to
adapt traditional oven-baked pie recipes to quick biscuit treats that could be cooked in Dutch
ovens. <a href="foodpies.html#potpie">Pot pie</a> is a closely related recipe.
<p>
<b>Why call it cobbler?</b><br>
Our dictionaries, word history books and food history reference sources
generally agree the term cobbler, as it applies to a fruit dessert covered
with rough biscuit dough, originated in the American west in the middle of
the 19th century. Where did the name come from? Most of our books simply
state "source unknown." <i>The Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology</i>/Barnhart adds: 
 "A kind of pie baked in a deep dish,. 1859, American English, but
perhaps ultimately related to, or even developed from unrecorded use of
cobeler, n. 1385, a kind of wooden bowl or dish." (p. 184)
<p>
 In the absence of documented evidence, educated guesses may be
constructed. It is possible the name derived from the look of the final
product. Cob/cobble/cobber convey many meanings in the English language.
Elizabeth David (<i>English Bread and Yeast Cookery</i>)tells us traditional English "cob" bread was small, brown and round. Similar, perhaps
to cobbletones. Perhaps this is what the the first cobbler resembled?
<p>
While American dictionaries date the first print instance of the term "cobbler" in 1859, Nancy Baggett (fellow IACP
member and cookbook author) recently located this older reference. Proving? Culinary history sleuthing is often the result 
of careful reading and research.  <blockquote>
<b>[1839]<br>
"A Peach Pot-Pie.</b><br>
A Peach pot pie, or cobler, as it is often termed, should be made of clingstone peaches, that are very ripe, and then pared and sliced from the stones. Prepare a pot
 or oven with paste, as directed for the apple pot-pie, put in the prepared peaches, sprinkle on a large handful of brown sugar, pour in plenty of water to cook the 
peaches without burning them, though there should be but very little liquor or syrup when the pie is done. Put a paste over the top, and bake it with moderate heat, 
raising the lid occasionally, to see how it is baking. When the crust is brown, and the peaches very soft, invert the crust on a large dish, put the peaches evenly on, 
and grate loaf sugar thickly over it. Eat it warm or cold. Although it is not a fashionable pie for company, it is very excellent for family use, with cold sweet milk." 
---<i>The Kentucky Housewife</i>, Lettice Bryan, facsimile reprint of 1839 edition stereotyped by Shepard & Stearns:Cincinnati [Image Graphics:Paducah KY]  (p. 268) 

</blockquote>
<p>
The <i>Dictionary of Americanisms</i> traces the first instance of the word cobbler (as it applies
to a pie dish) in print to 1859: "Cobbler...a sort of pie, baked in a pot lined with dough of great
thickness, upon which fruit is placed." 
<p>
"Another kind of cobbler is a western- deep-dish pie with a thick crust and a fruit filling. This dish
is called bird's nest pudding or crow's nest pudding in New England; it is served with a custard by
no topping in Connecticut, with maple sugar in Massachusetts, and with a sour sauce in
Vermont."<br>

<b>A:</b> When we didn't find any references to Franchonettes in any culinary sources (food dictionaries, French texts, dictionaries (OED, Larousse), 
historic newspapers or magazines), we did what everyone else does. We Googled. There we found a few references to Franchonettes. The source that provided the

Place the basin in another of boiling water, and stir (over the fire) until it thickens, perhaps from eight to ten minutes; then add the butter and set away to cool. 
Line little patty pans with puff paste, or any rich paste, rolled very thin. Put a spoonful of the mixture in each one, and bake in a slow oven from twelve to twenty 
minutes. When cool, slip out of the pans, and serve on a napkin. They are nice for lunch, tea or children's parties, only for parties make them small. The mixture for

<a name="frisbie">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Frisbie Pies</b></font><br>

According to the records of the US Patent & Trademark Office, Wham-O introduced its iconic Frisbee flying disc June 17, 1957. The inventor? Walter Fred 
Morrison. The original prototype? Inexpensive metal pie plates. The inspiration? Throwing empty pie plates was popular on college student diversion during the
 Great Depression. The name? Frisbie Baking Company, Bridgeport, Ct. Who was the first person to throw a pie plate and yell Frisbee? We will never know.
 There are several claimants to this honor. Because Frisbie pies were sold in New England, we can assume the fad with this name began there. This does not 
preclude the possibility of other people hurling similar objects in other parts of the country (world?) achieving the same purpose.
What did a <img src="frisbie.gif">Frisbie pie tin</a> look like?
<p>
"The Frisbee started as an obscure fad with a beginning as modest as a five-cent pie tin. It is widely believed that restless Yale students 
discovered it when they decided to throw pie tins instead of returning them to the Frisbie Pie Company in Bridgeport, Conn., for their nickel 
deposit."<br>---"Technology: The Wonders of the Frisbee," <i>New York Times</i>, July 5, 1978 (p. D5) 
<p>
"It's one of Richard Burton's favorite forms of exercise. Carol Greiltzer, a New York City councilwoman, does it at every opportunity....What they 
do is fly Frisbees, and they have lots of company. A Frisbee is a plastic disk about the size of a pie pan that can soar, dip or bank like a glider 
when thrown properly. First introduced commercially about a dozen years ago by Wham-O Manufacturing Co., Frisbees until recently were
 regarded primarily as novelties for children. But of lately the flying of Frisbees has become something of a national craze among adults...Soldiers 
in Vietnam find a Frisbee session relaxing after a day in the bush chasing the Vietcong...Guts Frisbee is played by two five-man teams standing 
about 15 yards apart. They hurl the plastic disks at each other with awesome force, scoring points when an opponent fails to catch a throw 
one-handed...Legends about the origins of Frisbee are many--all probably apocryphal. One has it that way back in 1837 a Yale man named 
Frisbee sailed a church collection plate 200 feet across the campus in protest against compulsory chapel. Movie people claim it all started in 
Hollywood in the 1940s when film editors relaxed at lunch by scaling empty film tins. But most Frisbee historians agree that the modern era began
 after World War II when the clientele of the now-defunct Frisbie Baking Co. of Bridgeport Conn., found that the tin plates holding Mother 
Frisbie's pies were great for soaring. In the late 1950s, Fred Morrison, a pie-tin tosser of notable skill, took the idea to Wham-O. The company. 
The company has since sold several million Frisbees, and Mr. Morrison has raked in close to $500,000. in royalties."<br>
---"Frisbee Fad Attracts Fans Seeking Sport." W. Stewart Pinkerton, <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, July 2, 1969 (p. 1) 
<p>
"In the beginning, of course, a Frisbee was a tin plate holding a pie that was produced by the thousands in a Bridgeport bakery. The Frisbee Pie 
Company was its name, and somewhere between 1871 (When William R. Frisbie started the business) and 1920 (when somebody saw the fun in 
tossing the empty tins), Frisbee started on its way to becoming one of America's rare native sports. A mispelling early in the game changed an 'i'
 to 'e' a man on the West Coast (W. Fred Morrison) began manufacturing aerodynamically improved version of the disk in 1957. ..A lot has 
happened to a Frisbee since it held a pie, but a lot more has happened to the ability of Frisbee tossers. This becomes very evident in an Ultimate 
Frisbee match, where a team, of seven players tries to pass a Frisbee down a 60-yard field without letting it hit the ground or be blocked by an
 opposing team of seven...The ball is dead, as far as Frisbee freaks are concerned. A ball holds no mystery, they contend, has a slavish 
attachment to the earth and falls quickly if missed in the initial attempt to catch it. But not the Frisbee, which exists just to fly."<br>
---"To Frisbee Fans, It's the Ultimate," Parton Keese, <i>New York Times</i>, August 7, 1977 (p. CN1) 
<p>
"Students at Yale University insist they were the first to pick up a Frisbie Pie Company plate and fling it into the air. But similar claims have 
come
 from Princeton and other Easter colleges and universities. Olin Robinson, Middlebury College's president, said both were wrong...'it started here.' 
To honor its certainty, the college unveiled a bronze sculpture a few weeks ago by Patrick Farrow, and artist, of a dog catching a flying disc in its 
mouth. Middlebury officials contend that a group of Delta Upsilon fraternity brothers tumbled into the game while traveling to a fraternity 
convention in Nebraska 50 years ago. Short on cash while on the road, the men took Frisbie fruit pies with them to eat, the story goes. They
 tossed the leftover tin back and forth to amuse themselves while waiting for a flat tire to be repaireid. Frist Pie-Tin Throwers. It was 1939. 'That
 fall in Middlebury the air was filled with flying pans, every size and shape,' said a story in Middlebury's alumni newspaper in the spring of 1976. 
'Grade-point averages dropped, football atttendance suffered and all stores were out of pie pans.' But even the college's official version is 
disputed by one of the Middlebury students, who said he had participated in the fateful event. Elbert Cole, a retired chemist living in Palo Alto, 
Calif., said he and another fraternity brother found a pie tin in a Nebraska cornfield and tossed it to each other, yelling 'Frisbie.' 'People have 
been throwing pie pans forever, but that's how it got to be called Frisbie.' [said] Mr. Cole...Yale suggests that its students were the first to
 throw pie-tins because the Frisbie Pie Company, which was based in Bridgeport, Conn., likely sold pies near Yale. David Iovanne, director of the 
New Haven Convention and Visitor Bureau, said it is part of New Haven lor that Yale students were the first pie-tin tossers...After World War II,
 the travels of the flying pie tins became easier to document, said Daniel Roddick of the Wham-O Manufacturing Company in San Gabriel, Calif., 
which makes the modern plastic Frisbee. In 1948, Walter Fred Morrison, a West Coast inventor and building inspector, made plastic versions and 
marked them as flying saucers, In 1957, Wham-O discovered the popularity of a game called Frisbie that was played mostly on college campuses 
on the East Coast. The company liked the name and began selling Frisbees under a registered trademark. They later learned of the Frisbie Pie 
Company...'As to the documentation on who cast the first one without a blueberry pie in it, that's a bit of a challenge,'...I think what you have 
here is a pretty spontaneous response to a natural opportunity...It just brought a lot of happiness and joy to people at a time when the world 
was getting ready for World War II...It just brought release."<br>---"It All Started With Pie Tins in the Air," <i>New York Times</i>, July 9, 1989 (p. 31)

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Gateau St. Honore</b></font><br>
Food historians generally agree Gateau Saint Honore belongs to Paris (because St. Honore is the
patron
Saint of patisserie and has a street name in Paris after him), but are collectively vague regarding 
the
period. Neither do they attibute the creation of this confection to a specific chef or agree on the
history
behind the name. <a href="foodpuddings.html#chiboust">Chiboust</a> (for whom the creme
used in this recipe was named) was a mid-19th
century
patissiere. Quite the mystery, yes?
<p>
The ingredients and method of Gateau Saint Honore date the possibility of this recipe to the 17th
century.
Primary evidence confirms master Parisian patissieres often employed choux and cream to effect
grand
dessert presentations. Croquant was "invented" at this time. Chantilly creme (sometimes referred
to as
Chiboust) was also "invented" in the 17th century. We find nothing close to Saint Honore in La
Varenne
[1651], but Ude's <i> French Cook</i> [1828] contains several recipes which might been
precursors. These
are generally composed of choux artfully arranged and filled with chantilly cream. Unlike Gateau
Saint
Honore, however, do not employ shortcrust. 
<p>
Escoffier [1903] contains a recipe for Creme a Saint-Honore (#4345), but not (at least that we
can find)
Gateau Saint Honore. Neither does it show up in Richardin [1913]. The original edition of <i>
Larousse
Gastronomique</i> [1938]  includes both description and recipe (en Francais, we can send if you
like).
<p>
<b>What is Gateau Saint Honore?</b><br>
Gateau Saint Honore, a confection of two kinds of pastry with a cream filling. Shortcrust pastry
provides a
firm base for the soft and flexible choux pastry piled round it on top. Glazed profiteroles are stuck
to the ring
of choux. The centre of the ring is filled with a creamy mixture (creme chiboust) stiffened with
gelatin and
lightened with stiffly beaten egg whites. This cake is sometimes said to have been named after St.
Honore,
the patron saint of bakers, but others say that it owes its name to the rue Saint-Honore in Paris,
where it was
created (possibly as a development of some existing product) in 1846 by a patissiere, Chiboust.
The
learned authors of the Ile-de-France volume listed under IPCF (1993) explain why they regard the
matter as
an unsolved mystery."<br>

Food historians and primary evidence place the genesis of this American pie in the late
1950s/early 1960s.
Chiffon pies were very popular at that time. The "grasshopper" name is borrowed from a popular
green-colored cocktail, also *invented* about this time. There is speculation this recipe was
invented by food/drink
companies to promote their products. It is quite likely, although we cannot verify in print.

This is what the food historians have to say:

"I suspect--but cannot verify--that [Grasshopper Pie] recipes descend from one that appeared in
High
Spirited Desserts, a recipe flier publsihed jointly by Knox Unflavored Gelatine and Heublein
Cordials. It
begins "Dinner guests sometimes click their heels with glee over a superb dessert." Then it goes
on to urge
the reader to be "devil-may-care. Knox Unflavored Gelatine provides a variety of handsome and
delectable
dishes. Heublein Cordials provide the spirits that give each sweet masterpiece inimitable flavor.
Serve with
pride. Await applause modestly." Unfortunately, there's no date on the leaflet. Given its yellowing
state,
however, its purple prose, and whimsical Jester illustrations, I suspect that it belongs to the late 
50s or,
possible, the early  60s."<br>

The earliest NYT recipe for Grasshopper Pie, as we Americans know it today, was published in
1963. It
does not reference any specific name-brand products. It does, however, confirm the propularity of
this
dessert in the time frame established by the food historians:
<blockquote>
<b>"Grasshopper Pie</b><br>
Crumb shell:<br>
1 1/4 cups chocolate wafer crumbs<br>
1/4 cup sugar<br>
1/3 cup melted butter<br>
1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. <br>
2. Mix the chocolate crumbs, sugar and butter. Press the mixture against the bottom and sides of a
nine-inch pie plate. Bake five minutes and chill.<br>
<b>Filling:</b><br>
1 envelope gelatin<br>
1/2 cup sugar<br>
1/8 teaspoon salt<br>
1/2 cup cold water<br>
3 eggs, separated<br>
1/4 cup green creme de menthe<br>
2 tablespoons cognac or creme de cacao<br>
1 cup heavy cream, whipped.<br>
1. Combine in the top of a double boiler the gelatin, half the sugar and salt. Stir in the water and
blend in the
egg yolks, one at a time. Place the mixture over boiling water, stirring constantly until gelatin is
dissolved
and mixture thickens slightly, four to five minutes.<br>
2. Remove the mixture from the heat and stir in the creme de menthe and cognac. Chill, stirring
occasionally, until mixture has a consistency resembling unbeaten egg white.<br>
3. Beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry, then gradually stir in remaining sugar. Continue
beating until
whites are very stiff. Fold them into the gelatin mixture. Fold in the whipped cream and turn
mixture into
chocolate crumb shell. Chill until firm and garnish. If desired, with additional whipped cream. 
Yield: One nine-inch pie."<br>

Is it possible to mix up several ingredients, pour it into a baking recepticle and have the layers naturally settle into
a pie formation (crust on the bottom; filling on the top). Yes, according to the makers of Impossible pie. This 20th century
novelty recipe took some parts of our country by storm.
<p>
The origins of Impossible Pie (aka mystery pie, coconut amazing pie) are sketchy at best. A
survey of newspaper/magazine articles suggests this recipe originated in the south (where
coconut custard pies are popular). It was *discovered* by General Mills (Bisquick) and
General Foods, who capitalized on the opportunity to promote their products. Corporate
recipes surfaced in the mid-1970s. There are conflicting reports about the dates of
introduction. The earliest recipe we have on file was published in 1968. None of the ingredients are name-brand.
<p>

This article sums up it best:<br>
"Amazing. Mysterious. It could be none other than Impossible Pie, one of the most successful
corporate recipe projects in the U.S. food-marketing history. Versions of Impossible Pie were
also named Mystery Pie or Amazing Coconut Pie. By any name, though, Americans took to
the easy recipe that is adaptable for making both sweet dessert pies and savory meat, vegetable
and cheese pies. Back when quiche was trendy, the Impossible Pie formula called for
ingredients similar to those for quiche yet eliminated the need to make a separate pastry
crust...Not one but two huge food corporations benefited by popularizing the simple recipe
formula for the Impossible Pie mixtures: the two big "Generals." One was the Minneapolis-based General Mills, home of mythical Betty Crocker and maker of Bisquick all-purpose
baking mix. The other was General Foods of White Plains, N.Y., marketer of Angel Flake
processed coconut...The real mystery: Where did this recipe originate? We know the two
"Generals" took a basic formula and then developed variations to showcase their respective
products. Lisa Van Riper, spokeswoman for Kraft General Foods, said the company's well-advertised recipe for Amazing 
Coconut Pie, "was developed as a result of a creative
adaptation of the Bisquick Impossible Pies. We took a Bisquick Impossible Pie and did a
creative twist by adding coconut, raisins and some other things. That was developed in June
1976 by our test-kitchen's task force from a recipe submitted by various sources. Essentially
that source was the Bisquick Impossible Pie. The Amazing Coconut Pie recipe also forms its
own crust--with the baking mix sinking to the bottom of a custard mixture--and has been used
ever since 1976, according to Van Riper. General Mills' Marcia Copeland, director of Betty
Crocker foods and publications, recalls that "we first saw the recipe for (crustless) coconut
custard pies in Southern community cookbooks." So it was a grass-roots recipe first, origin
unknown. Some very old community cookbooks contain pie recipes that make their own
crusts just from flour; others call for homemade biscuit mix. Copeland said that the
Impossible Pie phenomenon lasted from the late 1970s through the  80s...
General Mills' home economists developed variations for Impossible Chicken  n' Broccoli
Pie, for Enchilada, Lasagna, Taco, Pizza and Beef Mushroom Impossible Pies, even an
Impossible Turkey  n' Stuffing Pie..."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Key lime pie</b></font><br>
Certainly, such a popular pie would have much available in the way of history. Not! Food
historians confirm
the popularity of limes (a gift from 16th century Spanish explorers), presence of pies (an  "Old
World"
recipe), and eager acceptance of condensed milk (mid-19th century). Presumably, the
"inspiration" for Key
Lime pie is <a href="foodpies.html#lemon">Lemon meringue</a>.
<p>
"According to John Egerton (Southern Food, 1987), Key Lime Pie was known in the Florida
Keys "as far
back as the 1890s." It don't doubt it a bit because in those pre-refrigerator days, fresh milk was a
poor
keeper. What local cooks had learned to rely on was the sweetened condensed milk Gail Borden
had
begun canning shortly before the Civil War."<br>

Anderson

[NOTE: This book has a recipe for Key Lime Pie.]
<p>
"Key lime pies were first made in the Keys in the 1850s. Jean A. Voltz, in <i>The Flavor of the
South</i>
(1993), explains that the recipe developed with the advent of sweetened condensed milk in 1856.
Since
there were few cows on the Keys, the new canned milk was welcomed by the residents and
introduced into
a pie made with lime juice. The original pies were made with a pastry crust, but a crust made from
graham
crackers later became popular and today is a matter of preference, as is the choice between
whipped
cream and meringue toppings. There are three recipes for Key lime pie in <a href="foodpies.html#1949keylime""><i>The Key West Cook
Book</i></a>
(1949), only one of which refers to a graham-cracker crust, and two of which do not require the
pie to be
baked. One has no topping, one whipped cream, and one meringue."<br>

<b>Recipe for The Breakers Key Lime Pie?</b><br>
"Q. I would like to make a good key lime pie. I think the version at The Breakers in Palm Beach is outstanding. Could you get the recipe?-- M. Herzog, Highland Beach
<br>
A. Executive chef Michael Norton provided the recipe, which uses typical key lime pie ingredients -- but with several significant differences in their use. The recipe calls for about twice as much condensed milk as the standard recipe, and then the pie is baked, rather than simply refrigerated. The result is a very creamy filling, a bit stiffer and higher than the usual, that lacks the raw egg flavor one sometimes encounters in a key lime pie. The use of cake flour in the pastry makes the crust very tender and delicate; use some extra care in the rolling process.
<p>
<b>THE BREAKERS' KEY LIME PIE </b><br>
<b>Crust:</b><br>
5 tablespoons shortening<br>
7 tablespoons cake flour<br>
2 tablespoons sugar<br>
1 egg<br>
3 tablespoons milk<br>
<b>Filling:</b><br>
3 egg yolks<br>
5 ounces (10 tablespoons) lime juice<br>
2 14-ounce cans, minus 4 tablespoons, sweetened condensed milk<br>
<b>Garnish:</b><br>
Lightly sweetened whipped cream<br>
Lime slices<br>
To make the crust: Cut the shortening into the flour. Sprinkle on the sugar, then blend in the egg and milk. Roll on a lightly floured surface into a circle to fit a deep, 10-inch pie plate. Place in plate, prick bottom and sides, weight with beans or rice and bake about 6 minutes at 375 degrees, or until pastry is a light brown. Cool before filling.

To make the filling: Beat the egg yolks, lime juice and condensed milk until smooth and creamy. Pour into pre-baked pie shell and bake 15 minutes at 350 degrees. Watch pastry crust during this time; if the rim starts to get too brown, shield with foil. Cool pie and then top with whipped cream. Garnish with slices of fresh lime. Makes 8 to 10 servings.

Several readers wrote with suggestions for those who suffer from the hard brown sugar blues. "I take it out of the cardboard box as soon as I bring it home from the
 store," said Sally Lewis of Miami. "I then repack it in an airtight Tupperware container. In 11 years of using this method I've never had a case of hard brown sugar,
 even when I've kept the same sugar for a year." Dorothy Ligush of Pompano Beach advocates using the same method. "It will save a lot of tempers." She says that
 if the sugar does pack some from nonuse, "I just run a fork or knife through it to fluff it." J. Pierce says she uses a wide-mouth glass jar to store her brown and confectioners' sugars and never is faced with hardness or too much moisture."

Frozen lime pie is an interation of Key lime pie. The oldest mention we find in print for the frozen
pie  implies
the recipe existed at least as early as the 1970s. Of course, most recipes exist long before they
appear in

"Mabel Brotzman asked for help in finding a lost recipe for a Key Lime Pie that can be frozen for
serving later. We
received dozens of replies from readers. Marcia H. Kenward said she'd clipped the recipe from
The Miami Herald "at
least 30 years ago." That recipe calls for stirring in 1 to 2 drops of green food coloring if desired.
As Dot Schuck of Key
Largo puts it: "Most folks from up North think Key lime should be green." The vintage recipe
calls for separated eggs in
the filling, which makes it more involved but airier in texture. The more popular recipe, at least as
far as our mail
indicates, is made with frozen whipped topping. Barbara Bliss sent her boyfriend Dave's incredibly
easy recipe, which is
similar to many we received. Tips: If you are making your own graham cracker crust, try brushing
egg white on the top
just before baking to keep the crust crisp. Remove the pie from the freezer no more than 5
minutes before serving. Paula
Prouty of Key West and Scarborough, Maine, where she is a newspaper food editor, simply
makes a regular Key lime
pie, with a meringue top, and then freezes it.

"Lemon-meringue pie, made with lemon curd and topped with meringue, has been a favorite
American dessert since the nineteenth century."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New
York] 1999 (p. 182)
<p>
Elizabeth Coane Goodfellow (1767-1851) is credited for introducing lemon meringue pie to
America in her Philadelphia shops [<i>The Larder Invaded: Reflections on Three Centuries of
Philadelphia Food and Drink</i>, Mary Anne Hines, Gordon Marshall & William Woys Weaver,
Historical Society of Philadelphia, Philadelphia 1987 (p. 66). Becky L. Diamond's <i>Mrs Goodfellow: The Story of 
America's First Cooking School</i> [2012] devotes an entire chapter to the evolution of Lemon Meringue pie. The author
states "no one know...exactly how or when [lemon meringue pie] was originally conceived." (p. 158).
<a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=moa;idno=AEL7629"><i>Mrs. Goodfellow's Cookery as it Should Be</i></a>
 (1865) offers three recipes for lemon pudding, some in pastry shells (p. 229, 230 & 243), no lemon pies, and the
 sole reference to meringue(s) (p. 199) is for small confections, not as topping. 
<p>
<b>Where is lemon meringue pie considered a "traditional" dessert?</b><br>
 Many places are associated for this
particular pie. Most of them are in the South. Lemons are a favorite component of southern
cooking. Think lemon chess pie and lemonade. 
<p>
"Lemon meringue pie has been around a long time in the South and most likely grew out of the
vast repertoire of puddings, whose popularity pies eclipsed in the late nineteenth century. It is
remarkably similar ot the Queen of Puddings." <br>
---<i>Biscuits, Spoonbread, and Sweet Potato Pie</i>, Bill Neal [Alfred A. Knopf:New York]
1996 (p. 275) 
<p>
"A pie can always be turned out for dessert as long as there are lemons in the house, and
American cooks have devised many recipes. President Calvin Coolidge is said to have favored a
simple lemon custard pie. The even more common lemon meringue, ever present in public eating
places, is one more dish served at Boston's Parker House that has become a classic in the
American repertoire. And a special version gained fame swiftly when it went on the menu of the
Lion House Social Center in Salt Lake. The following version is based on a method worked out in
the 1960s by the late Michael Field in collaboration with Dr. Paul Buck, a food scientist at Cornell
University. The determined Mr. Field devoted days to making lemon meringue pie after another
until he eliminated the "weeping" common to meringues that sit around on counter; his trick was
to use a little calcium phosphate powder, a food-grade phosphate product available in drugstores
and suggested by Dr. Buck." <br>

Many 17th and 18th century cookbooks contain recipes for lemon custard, pudding (sometimes
served in a puff-paste base), pies, and tarts. These are often topped with pulverized sugar. It is
not until the middle of the 19th century we find recipes that would produce lemon meringue pie,
though they are not titled as such:<p>

Blanch and beat eight ounces of Jordan almonds with orange flower water. Add to them half a
pound of cold butter, the yolks of ten eggs, the juice of a large lemon, half the rind grated fine,

ABOUT MERINGUE<br>
<p>
Food historians tell us the precursor for meringue was an Elizabethan-era dish called <a href="foodeggs.html#snow">"Snow"</a>.
 (aka snow eggs). What exactly is meringue and who is credited for the discovery? 
<p>
"Meringue...an airy, crisp confection of beaten egg white and sugar. The word probably entered
French from German, as did many other French words ending in -ingue. It first appeared in print
in Massailot [1691], although earlier recipes for the same thing but without the name had been
published. The name travelled to England almost at once and first appeared in print there in
1706....It seems to have been only in the 16th century that European cooks discovered that
beating egg whites, e.g. with a whisk of birch twigs (in the absense of any better implement),
produced an attractive foam. At first the technique was used to make a simple, uncooked dish
called snow, made from egg white and cream. However, cooking such a foam would not have
resulted in meringue, for any fat in the mixture, as represented by the cream, prevents the egg
whites from taking on the proper texture...When true meringue made its appearance in the 17th
century, it still lacked its name and was often called "sugar puff.""<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
197)
<p>
"Meringue. The name for this confection of sugar and beaten egg white is a direct borrowing from
French "meringue." but beyond that its origins are obscure. Legend has it variously that it was
named after the town of Meringen in central Switzerland of after the Saxon town of
Mehringyghen, seat of the operations of the Swiss pastrycook Gasparini who supposedly invented
it there in 1720. However, the fact that the word had even entered the English language before
this (it is first mentioned in Edward Phillip's dictionary <i>The New World of English Words</i>,
in John Kersey's 1706 edition) casts considerable doubt on the story. In fact, mixtures of beaten
egg white and sugar cooked in a slow oven had been popular since the early seventeenth century
(they were called "Italian biscuit"), and it was the great increase in the proportion of egg white
which marked the inception of the superlight meringue towards the end of the century."<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p.
211)<br>
[The 2008 online <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> confirms the earliest Englis print reference for meringue dates to 1706:<br>

1. a. A light mixture of stiffly beaten egg whites and sugar, baked until crisp; a shell or other item of confectionery made of this mixture, typically decorated or filled with whipped cream.
In some recipes, esp. when meringue is used as a topping, cooking of the mixture is stopped before it is completely crisp: cf. SNOW n.1 5a. 
1706 Phillips's New World of Words (ed. 6), Meringues (Fr. in Cookery), a sort of Confection made of the Whites of Eggs whipt; fine Sugar, and grated Lemmon-peel, of the bigness of a Wal-nut; being proper for the garnishing of several Dishes. 
<p>
"Whites of eggs produced the Elizabethan  dishful of snow, a spectacular centrepiece for the
banquet course following a festal meal...The beating of egg whites was not altogether easy before
the fork came into common use late in the seventeenth century...A 1655 recipe for  cream with
snow suggested a cleft stick, or a bundle of reeds tied together and roll between your hands
standing upright in your cream....at the turn of the [17th] century a still lighter creation was
introduced from France, in which the proportion of frothed egg white to sugar was greatly
increased. The new arrival was quickly added to the sweetmeats of Britain, among which it is still
to be found. Its French name remains unaltered. It was the meringue."<br>

The 1938 edition of <i>Larousse Gastronomique</i> tell us that meringue was invented in 1720
by a
Swiss pastry chef named Gasparani. Queen Marie Antoinette is said to have enjoyed these. Recent 
editions of this book do not reference the 1720 date and they attribute the invention of meringue
to Gasparini, a Swiss pastrycook who practiced his art in a small the small German town of
Meiringen. Recent editions also add that until the early 19th century, meringues cooked in the
oven were shaped with a spoon; it was Careme who first had the idea of using a piping bag.

indicates flour was never a traditional ingredient. Book includes modernized recipe/instructions.]
<p>
<b>[1828]<br>
"Dry Meringues.</b><br>
It is to be observed, that meringues, to be well made, require the eggs to be fresh, and that you
are not to break them till the very moment you are going to use them. Have some pounded sugar
that is quite dry, break the white of the eggs into a clean and very deep pan, break them without
loss of time, tell they are very firm, then take as many spoonsful of sugar as you have whites, and
beat them lightly with the eggs till the whole is well mixed. Observe, that you are to be very
expedtious in making the meringues, to prevent the sugar from melting in the eggs. Have some
boards thick enough to prevent the bottom of the meringues from getting baked in the oven. Cut
slips of paper two inches broad, on which place the meringues with a spoon; give them the shape
of an egg cut in half, and let them all be of an equal size: sift some sugar over them, and blow off
the sugar that may have fallen on the paper; next lay your slips of paper on a board, and bake
them in an oven moderately hot. As soon as they begin to colour remove them from the oven:
take each slip of paper by the two ends, and turn it gently on a table; take off a little of the middle
with a small spoon. Spread some clean paper on the board, turn the meringues upside down on
that paper, and put them into the oven, that the crumb or soft part may be baked and acquire
substance. When you have done this, keep them in a dry place till wanted. Then you send them up
to table, fill them with creme a la Chantilli, or with something acid. Remember, however, that you
are not to use articles that are very sweet, the meringues being sweet in themselves. Mind that the
spoon is to be filled with sugar to the brim, for the sweeter the meringues are, the better and
crisper they are; but if, on the contrary, you do not sugar enough, the meringues are tough. The
pink is sometimes made by adding a little carmine diluted in some of the apareil, but the white
ones are preferable; if a clean sheet of paper is put into a small stock-pot, and the meringues also
put therein, and well covered, they will keep for one or two months as good and crisp as the first
day: on which account, if you have a vacancy for one dish, which is wanted in haste, it will be
found very advantageous to have them made beforehand."<br>

spoon; then mix two spoonsful of marasquin with the whole; dress the meringues on some paper
as above, and glaze with sugar sifted over them, before you put them into the oven, which, by the
by, is not to be so hot as for other meringues. As soon as the top gets a substance, take them from

<b>Where did lemons come from?</b><br>
Lemons (and other citrus fruits) were known to ancient cooks. This fruit's
acid flavor was appreciated and incorporated into many dishes. In the beginning, lemons were expensive and
usually preserved (dried) then used in cakes reserved for special occasions. Fruitcake, great bride's
cake, Gallette du Roi are European examples. 
The lemon cakes, we know today, trace their roots to Medieval European cooks. These cooks
often
used "perfumed waters" (such as rosewater) to flavor their foods and for medicial purposes.
Recipes
for these "perfumes" were later employed to make fruit flavorings. Orange water (aka
orangeflower
water) was popular in France during the seventeenth century. Culinary evidence confirms cakes,
cookies, puddings, cheesecakes, tarts, jellies, and other sweet desserts often incorporated orange
flavoring. Lemon recipes followed, often as a simple ingredent substitition for oranges. 
18th century English cookbooks list lemon cakes as a recipe variation for Orange Cakes (Mrs.
Raffald, <i>The Experienced English Housekeeper</i> [1769]. By the 19th century, lemon cakes
were
standard fare in American cookbooks. Popular American recipes featuring lemons include: 
<a href="foodpies.html#lemonmeringuepie">Lemon Meringue Pie</a>, <a href="foodcookies.html#lemonbars">Lemon Bars</a> 
& <a href="foodbeverages.html#lemonade">Lemonade</a>.
<p>
<b>Where did lemons originate?</b><br>
"Lemon
The fruit of Citrus medica, a tree whose original home may have been in the north of India. It only
reached the Mediterranean towards the end of the 1st century AD, whemn the Romans discovered
a direct sea route from the sourthern end of the Red Sea to India. Tolkowsky...adduces complex
arguments in favour of this view (as against the earlier view that the lemon did not arrive until the
10th century), and refers to frescos found at Pompeii (and therefore prior to AD 70) which show
what he regards as indisputably lemons; also a mosaic pavement probably from Tusculum...of
about 100 AD in which a lemon is shown with an orange and a citron.
Thus the fruit which can reasonably be regarded as the most important for European cookery was
a comparatively late arrival. Nor was its use in cookery, as an acid element, appreciated at once.
Nor, indeed, was there a Latin word for lemon. It seems likely that in classical Rome the fruit was
treated as a curiosity and a decoration, and that lemon trees were not grown in Italy until later. 
The Arabs seem to have been largely responsible for the spread of lemon cultivation in the
Mediterranean region...Arab traders also spread the lemon eastward to China...During the Middle
Ages lemons were rare and expensive in N. Europe, and available only to the rich...Lemons
reached the New World...in 1493, when Columbus, on his second voyage, established a
settlement on Haiti."<br>

here. Ask your librarian to help you find a copy of this book.] 
<p>
"The lemon...owes its name entirely to the botanists, for it was unkown to classical writers.
However, it was widely used from the Middle Ages onwards. It was regarded as an essential in
the seventeenth century...Originally from the foothills of the Kashmir, the lemon did not reach
China...until around 1900BC. In China, it was given the name limung, which it retained almost
unchanged when it moved on to Persia and Media. From the tenth century AD onwards the
Arabs, who called it li mum...took it all around the Mediterranean basin, eastwards to Greece by
way of Constantinople, westwards to Spain by way of Maghreb and Fezzan. The Spanish and
Russians retained the name limon, which becomes lemon in English..."<br>

"Lemons were one of the most sought after fruits in early modern Europe. Being associated with
sunny southern Europe they were considered healthy, much the same way we think of
Mediterranean foods today. Their juice was used as a condiment, especially on fish because its
acidity was thought to cut through the "gluey humors" abounding in seafood, making them more
digestible. Northern Europeans generally had to import lemons, but eventually a way to grow
them indoors was devised. Lemon peel, grated or candied lemon was also a typical garnish."<br>

was more likely to find a place among the medicines than as a regular article of diet....Captain
Cook...was supplied with lemon juice as a concentrated syrup, with most of the vitamin C
unwittingly boiled out in the preparation..."<br>

"Lemon.--The fruit of a tree closely related to the orange, citron and lime...The lemon grows wild in the north of India and has been long cultivated among the 
Arabs who carried its culture into Europe and Africa. It is now naturalized in the West Indies and other parts of tropical America...The pulp of the fruit abounds in
 citric acid. There is, however, a variety cultivated in the south of Europe, the juice of which is very sweet. The acid juice of the common kind is laregley employed
 in preparing the beverage known as lemonade...Lemons vary  very much in size, and the ordinary boxes contain from two hundred and forty to four hundred and
 twenty lemons each; the brands L and LL being used to designate sizes, single L;'s being the largest. They are wrapped separately in order to prevent decay by
 crushing together. Thin-skinned lemons are the juiciest. There are over thirty varieties of lemons in cultivation, but they are generally classified according to the 
place of growth or shipping. The principal importations into this country are from Sicily (Messina lemons) and from Valencia. The lemon can be successfully grown
 in Florida and California--products which are receiving great attention. The oil of lemon is largley used in cooking and confectionery; the extract of lemon, sold for
 domestic use, being simply a dilute solution of the oil in alcohol. The pure juice of the lemon is extremely efficacious in attacks of acute rheumatism."

The cargo of 2,400 boxes of oranges and 5,500 boxes of lemons that the
steamer Iniziativa brought from Messina was sold yesterday by Brown &
Seccomb of 25 State Street. Prices of lemons had been steadily advancing
for over a week, until an advance of $1 per box was reached, and a story
was started that a storm in the Mediterranean had shaken down a very
large number of lemons from the trees at Messina, and that consequently
there was a scarcity of that fruit, as the shaken lemons had rotted on
the ground. Mr. Brown, however, denied that there had been any storm about
Messina, and said that the advance in price was owing to the light
receipts and the warm weather. There were plenty of lemons in Messina, and
as soon as prices advanced here the shippers there would sent on all that
were needed. After the first sale yesterday prices declined 50 cents per
box."<br>

"There has been a considerable advance in the price of lemons, owing

partly to a shortage in the Sicilian crop. A box of lemons which would
sell in ordinary seasons for $2.50, is now worth between $5 and $6. The
dealers in this crop feel sure that nothing but prolonged cool weather can
diminish the present price of the fruit."<br>

Our survey of historic newspapers confirms lemons were sold by the dozen in 1928. Prices ranged from 21 to 41 cents a dozen, 
39 cents most prevalent. The majority of the ads were for Sunkist brand lemons. We cannot confirm packaging (sold in prepacked bags?). Of course, it is possible the were sold as individual units. Generally, individual items are priced higher than 
larger quantities. Take the price of a dozen, divide by 12, and add extra (round up for profit). 
<p>
<b>Lemons were actively promoted in 1928 for several different uses besides eating: </b><br>
"In this era of beautiful women, lemons are becoming very popular as cosmetics for the hands, face and hair. There seems to 
be some kind of belief that a highly decorated jar with a pretty ribbon helps the beautifier, but lemons are probably the most 
inexpensive as well as one of the most effective cosmetics obtainable. Every beauty shop uses lemons in some of its preparations, and 
many housewives make it a rule to use the juice of a lemon on their hands after washing the dishes or on their hair after a shampoo. 
The mild citric acid removes the soap curd that attaches itself to the hair after washing...[lemons] make an excellent 
dentifrice to use on sore and bleeding gums. Used night and morning it will make a remarkable change in tightening up loose gums 
and improving the circulation and cleanliness of the mouth. There are a number of household uses of lemon juice for removing rust, 
ink or fruit stains, polishing aluminum ware and piano keys. The lemon is chiefly valuable for its antiscorbutic vitamins. Bottled 
lemon juice, sterilized at low temperature may be kept for a long time and should be carried by those who are compelled to make long 
trips into regions that will be deficient in fresh fruit and vegetables. Lemons may be preserved from drying out by 
immersing in fresh cold water." <br>

Sweet lemons may take their place besides oranges and plumbs as a table delicacy. A new variety, as large as grape fruit and sweet 
enough to eat without sugar, has been developed by growers in Porto Rico, it is reported. Another unusual quality of the fruits, 
says <i>Popular Science Monthly</i>, is said to be a reasonably sweet penetrating odor. The lemons are being used as perfume in linen 
closets an the Island. Cultivators of the new fruit claim that the flavor lasts as long as two months." <br>

<b>MEYER LEMONS</b><br>
Sweet, tangy, delicious and amazing. If you have the opportunity to taste one of these special lemons, go for it!
Originating in China, introduced to the USA in 1908, popular in the 1930s.

<p>
"The Meyer Lemon is not a hybrid but is a distinct citrus species found only a few years ago in a remote region of China by one of the famous plant explorers of the
 United States Department of Agriculture, Mr. Fred Meyer. It is sometimes called the Chinese Dwarf Lemon because it does not grow as large as the ordinary 
Lemon tree. If it bore no fruit at all, the Meyer would still be worth planting as an ornamental in our gardens because it makes a spendid, bush, dense-foliaged
 shrub, growing to about eight feet and with flowers on it during almost the entire year....The fruit...is almost double the size of the usual Lemon, roundish-oval in
 shape, and of a rich orange-yellow color; about halfway between the Orange and the ordinary Lemon in appearance. It will serve any purpose to which a Lemon 
can be put and is available almost from the time the plant is put out, because the plants bear immediately and are almost never without fruit form that time on."<br>
---"Garden Notes," John A. Armstrong, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, February 12, 1933 (p. H12) 
<p>
"...for home places where room is not plentiful, the new Chinese dwarf lemon, the Meyer, is possibly the finest lemon that can be planted. The late Frank Meyer, 
plant explorer of the United States Department of Agriculture, did California a great service when he found this lemon in the door-yard plantings of China. It is much
 hardier and easier to grow than the commercial lemons of California. It will thrive anywhere in Southern California, not only producing big juicy orange-colored
 fruits, which can be used for all the purposes for which lemons are needed, but making a handsome ornamental plant. It reaches a height of eight feet and has
 luxuriant foliage, with big fragrant blooms which are even more highly perfumed than those of the orange."<br>
---"Why Mourn About Peaches?," John A. Armstrong, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, May 6, 1934 (p. H3)
<p>
"One of the best varities for back-yard production is the Meyer lemon, which has proven its value since its introduction in 1908. Discovered in dwarf form growing 
 in the gardens of China by Frank Meyer, this particualr variety will stand slightly colder temperatrues than other types, although all lemons are susceptible to frost 
damage. Fruit is of medium size, thin-skinned and smooth. Size of the tree may be an advantage in most gardens since it will only reach 8 ft. in height in 20 years, 
while producting an abundance of fragrant flowers and  yellow-orange fruit. Lemons ripen and begin to fall during the month of May."<br>

The practice of fashioning sweet desserts from many-layered pastry is an ancient tradition originating in the Middle East.
 Baked or fried, thick or thin, large or small, they are often served at festive occasions.
According to the food historians, filo/phyllo was of Turkish origin. One of the most popular
foods
made with this kind of dough is <a href="foodpies.html#baklava">baklava</a>. Milles-feuilles (literally, thousand leaves) was a 19th
century French invention based on the same principle and adapted to the tastes of the day. Today there are several variations
on this culinary theme. French Palmiers, Afghan <a href="http://www.foodtimeline.org/elephantears">Elephant Ears<a/> 
Spanish <a href="foodmexican.html#sopaipillas">sopaipillas</a>, & Native American fry bread descend from these traditions. 
<p>
Our food reference books state palmiers (also known as palm leaves) were invented around the
turn of the 20th century. The name suggests they were first made in France, but we find no
evidence confirming this. In fact, we find a recipe for palm leaves (Palmenblatter) in <i>Viennese
Cooking</i>, O. And A. Hess [Crown:New York] 1960 (p. 213), which suggests this pastry might
have commanded a broader swath of geography. We also find no attribute to the first
person/restaurant credited for cooking/serving this cookie. In the world of food history, this is not
uncommon.
   <p> 
"Palmier. A small pastry made of a sugared and double-rolled sheet of puff pastry cut into slices,
the distinctive shape of which resembles the foliage of a palm tree. First made at the beginning of
the 20th century, palmiers are served with tea or as an accompaniment to ices and desserts."<br>
---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, Completely revised and updated [Clarkson Potter] 2001 p. 832)
<p>
"Palmiers are small sweet biscuits made from puff pastry and shaped somewhat like butterflies.
To
their anonymous early twentieth-century inventor their shape evidently suggested more the
topknot of leaves on a palm, for French palmier means literally  'palm tree'."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 237)
<p>
"Palmier. Also called palm leaves, palmiers are small pastries made from sugar-encrusted puff
pastry. The sides of a rectangle of puff pastry are folded into the center, then folded over to make
four layers, and cut across the width into thin strips. These are laid on their sides on a baking
sheet and they fan out as they bake to resemble the leaves of palm trees. Palmiers are baked until
they are crisp and the sugar caramelizes to a rich golden brown. They are served with tea or
coffee or as an accompaniment to ice cream and other desserts. France."<br>
---<i>The International Dictionary of Desserts, Pastries and Confections</I>, Carole Bloom [Hearst
Books:New York ] 1995 (p. 210)
<p>

"Sometimes, you just have to hand it to French culinary genius. Take the palmier (palm-YAY).
It's a cookie, nothing more than flour, water, salt, a light sprinkling of sugar and immoderate
amounts of butter. Yet as the palmiers bake, the moisture in the butter-riddled layers evaporates,
causing the dough to puff into hundreds of paper-thin flakes. Meanwhile, the sugar caramelizes
ever so slightly, casting a glassy sheen. The result? A pastry whose crisp, caramelized exterior
gives way at the slightest pressure to countless crisp layers.  Ironically, such a delicacy originated
as a means for resourceful pastry chefs to salvage leftover puff pastry dough. (When you consider
the labor-intensive nature of puff pastry, you understand why one would want to use every last
piece.) Though simple, the technique used to make palmiers can be fraught with peril. When
rolled too tightly, sliced a smidgen too thick or underbaked by even a minute, the interior remains
soggy and leaden. When rolled too loosely or baked at excessive temperatures, the pastry
becomes brittle and shatters upon touch. And when caked with sugar, the delicate balance is lost
and the pastry becomes one-dimensional. Athough ubiquitous throughout France, the proper
palmier is hard to find here. At some American bakeries the Frisbee-size confection is as sweet
as saccharin and dubbed the "Elephant Ear." At Latin American markets, they may be labeled
orejas ("ears" in Spanish) though the only ones I have come across are packaged in plastic, which
suffocates the crisp pastry. And at a German bakery, I once requested a palmier and received
nothing more than a polite, though perplexed, stare. It seems I should have requested the rather
inelegantly named "Pig's Ear." Some franchise French bakeries, such as La Madeleine, have
"palmiers" that are far inferior to the "elephant ears" offered by Fresh Fields/Whole Foods
Market. Though mass production is no friend to the palmier because the slicing and sprinkling
go largely unpoliced, a notable exception is the downtown Washington location of Fresh
Fields/Whole Foods Market, whose elephant ears put most palmiers to shame. (Though all of the
stores use the same frozen puff pastry dough shipped from a French bakery in Manhattan, the P
Street store's bakery consistently turns out a crisp, buttery, flaky palmier, albeit the size of a
dinner plate.) Buonaparte Breads at Historic Savage Mill in Savage and in Baltimore produces a
fine palmier, but they no longer ship them to their retail customers in the District since they are
too fragile. Whether sent out with after-dinner espresso at Michel Richard's Citronelle in
Georgetown or nibbled as an elegant something to satisfy a sweet tooth on a leisurely afternoon,
the palmier can be an amazing thing. When you can find them. They are usually priced by the
pound and vary greatly in size. SEN5ES For the palmier lover, the pastry case at Georgetown's
sedate Sen5es Bakery and Restaurant is a sight to behold. Row after flawless row of compact,
perfectly wound palmiers are nestled against one another. While they last. "Believe me," says
pastry chef, Bruno Feldeisen. "If I don't have them, I hear about it!" 
Feldeisen says he doesn't make a profit on the palmiers. But it's one of the little things that chefs
do for their clientele. Most days, that is. "It needs to be made with love, and sometimes we don't
have the love," explains Feldeisen...PATISSERIE POUPON Ruth Poupon's
rendition of a palmier defines daintiness. Slightly larger than a silver dollar (or rather, a French
franc) and so thin as to be almost diaphanous, it seems as though it might shatter if breathed
upon. But it is surprising sturdy. (Those at the bottom of the bag do tend to break though.) The
appropriately faint sweetness is underscored by a crisp, barely colored pastry that, lacking much
caramelization, in truth seems almost more butter cookie than palmier...AMERNICK At first glance, Amernick
bakery in Cleveland Park may seem an unlikely source for a palmier. Yet Ann Amernick, who
has held pastry chef positions with Michel Richard and White House pastry chef Roland
Mesnier, chose to include, amid her eclectic assortment of pastries, a rendition laced not with
sugar but a sharp, salty blend of Parmigiano-Reggiano and aged Dutch Gouda cheeses.
Amernick's savory rendition is best appreciated when taken home and warmed in the oven. Why
a savory palmier? It's a carry-over from the days when Amernick's bakery was in Wheaton, on
the site of a former Dutch bakery. The palmiers were a favorite of customers, says Amernick.
"And I liked them." An equally laudatory stick version is also available..."<br>

This sweet pastry means different things to different people. From Afhgan national cuisine to USA country fair fare. Each
is delicious in its own right. Recipes and cooking methods vary according to place and expectation.
<p>

Recipe for traditional Afghani Goash-e-Feel (iced with nuts) here: <blockquote>
<b>"Goash-E-Feel (Elephant's ear pastry) </b><br>
makes 8 
<p>
Elephant's ear pastry is the literal meaning of goash-e-feel, a name given because of the shape and size of these crisp, bubbly, sweet pastries. They are usually served with tea; and often a bride's family sends them to the bride and groom the day after the wedding. They are also made for Nauroz (New Year's Day, 21 March, the first day of spring). 
"For the best results, the pastry must be rolled paper thin, and the oil for frying must be very hot. <p>
"1 egg <br>
milk <br>
8 oz (225 g) plain white flour <br>
salt <br>
vegetable oil for frying <br>
2 oz (50 g) icing sugar <br>
2 oz (50 g) ground pistachio <br>
Break the egg into a bowl, beat it, and add enough milk to make the liquid up to 8 fl oz (225 ml). Sift the flour with a pinch of salt, add it to the egg and milk mixture, and mix well to form a firm dough. Knead on a lightly floured board for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Divide the dough into eight equal balls, cover with a moistened cloth and set to one side in a cool place for about half an hour. On a lightly floured board, roll out each of the eight balls until paper thin; they should be approximately 7" (18 cm) in diameter. Shape the 'ears' by pleating one side of each round piece of dough. Nip together with wet fingers, to prevent the pleats from opening during drying. In a frying-pan of similar diameter, heat enough oil to shallow-fry the pastries. When the oil is very hot, put in the 'ears' one at a time and fry until golden brown and bubbly, then turn and fry the other side until golden brown. As you remove the pastries from the pan, shake off the excess oil gently, then sprinkle them on both sides with a mixture of sifted icing sugar and ground pistachio.

"Dear readers: We have had great fun over the past month of so reading the letters that have poured in about elephant ears and funnel cake. It all began when we pubished
a letter from Ann Mehr of Schaumberg, who wanted a recipe for the elephant ears sold at Wisconsin county fairs. She described them as batter fried in deep fat and 
sprinkled with cinnamon. We replied that they sounded like the fried dough we get at our country fairs here in the East. We then got a letter from Linda Mao or Rocky 
Mount, N. C., who said, no, no, a thousand times no! What Ann is looking for is funnel cake, and she kindly sent us a recipe, which we published. Letters poured in
from Nebraska to New Hampshire, telling us that funnel cake and elephant ears are totally different, and depending on who was writing, that elephant ears aren't deep-fat
 fried anyway; they are BAKED. From Faye Bean of Friend, Neb.: "Here's the elephant ears recipe (my father used to call them 'shoe soles'). You can use any
 dinner-roll or bread recipe if you want to make them from scratch our you can use frozen dinner rolls instead of frozen bread."
<p>
"<b>Elephant Ears</b><br>
1 loaf frozen white (or sweet) bread dough, thawed<br>
3/4 cup sugar<br>
1 tablespoons brown sugar<br>
2 teasoons cinnamon<br>
3 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted<br>
Let dough rise untildoubled in size. Combine sugars and cinamon. Roll out dough on a floured surface to a 16-by-12-inch rectangle. Brush with half the butter and sprinkle
with 2 tablespoons of the sugar mixture. Fold in half and roll out again into a 16-by-12-inch rectangle. Brush with remaining butter and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of sugar
mixture. Roll up, starting with the 16-inch side. Cut into 16 pieces. Sprinkle rolling surface with sugar mixture. Roll out each piece into 1/8 to 1/4 inch, turning to coat both 
sides with sugar. Place on well-greased cookie sheets. Let rise 15 minutes and bake at 375 degrees for 15 to 18 minutes.

"The farther east the letters came from, the more frequently their writers suggested the deep-fry method using bread dough (either frozen or homemade). Lots of our readers
sent in this one. Shape a loaf-size portion of dough into 15 ovals or rounds, roll out until 5 1/2 inches round and 1/8 inch thick. Deep fry in 375 degree oil for 3 minutes on
each side until golden brown. Drain well and sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon. By the time we got to New Hampshire, elephant ears had turned into the following. This

Food historians generally agree pecan pie is a twentieth century invention inspired by traditional

and sweet nut confections. It is a favorite of the American south, as are <a href="foodcandy.html#praline">pralines</a>
 and other <a href="foodpies.html#pecans">pecan</a>

recreating nusstorte in the Lone Star state.
<p>
"As a good daughter of the South practically weaned on pecan pie, I had always assumed that it
dated back
to Colonial days. Apparently not. Still, I find it difficult to believe that some good plantation
cook didn't stir
pecans into her syrup pie or brown sugar pie. Alas, there are not records to prove it. In fact, I
could if no
cookbooks printing pecan pie recipes before the early twentieth century. And only in the 1940s did
"Fannie"
and "Joy" begin offering recipes for it. In <i>Southern Food: At Home, on the Road, in
History</i>
(1987)...John Egerton writes: "We have heard the claim that Louisianans were eating pecan
candies before
1800, and with sugar and syrup produced from cane at that time, it is conceivable theat they were
eating
pecan pies, too, but there are no recipes or other bits of evidence to prove it."...If Karo did not originate pecan pie, it certainly
popularized the recipe as a rifle through twentieth-century cookbooks large and small quickly
suggests.

<b>Pecans</b><br>
Pecans are a "new world" food. They are indigenous to North America and were known to Native
Americans long before the Europeans settled there. Traditionally, these nuts are connected with
the
American south where they have been incorporated into many sweet treats, especially <a href="foodpies.html#pecan">pecan pie</a> and
candy. The earliest print references come from European explorers.
<p>
"Pecan. The most important nut of N. America, is bourne by one of the hickory trees, Carya
illinoiensis. The
hickories, which are related to walnut trees, include several species of edible nuts...but the pecan
is much
the best. Its native habitat is the central southern region of the USA. The name comes from the
Algonquin
Indian paccan, which denoted hickories, including pecans...Most pecans now some from
cultivated trees,
although many old, wild trees continue to produce nuts which are gathered and marketed. ..The
main uses
of pecans are in sweet dishes and confectionery, although they are also used in a stuffing for
turkey. Pecan
pie is one of the most famous American desserts. Pecan butter is also made."<br>

"Pecan. A North American nut (actually a kind of hickory nut) sometimes said to be a native of
Oklahoma,
the pecan...is really indigenous to an area extending from the U.S. Midwest throughout the South
and
Southwest into Mexico--a region where it still grows wild today. Pecans are commerically
cultivated in the
band of states running from Georgia west to New Mexico, as well as in Mexico, Brazil, and
outside of the
Western Hemisphere, in Israel, South America, and Australia. The first recorded instance of pecan
cultivation is said to have been when Thomas Jefferson carried the trees from the Mississippi and
gave
them to George Washington. But long before this--eons before the Europeans arrived--pecans
were an
important item in the diet of Native Americans living in the south-central region of North
America."<br>

<b>Where did pizza come from?</b><br>
Various combinations of cheese and flat bread [baked and
fried] were commonly eaten by ancient peoples. The <a
href="foodsauces.html#tomatoes"> tomato</a> is a new world food introduced to Europe by returning Spanish and Portuguese explorers in the 16th century. By
the 17th century, tomatoes and their byproducts (sauces, soups) were staple ingredients of many
southern European recipes. We will probably never know the name of the first person to
combine and serve tomatoes, cheese and flat bread. References to Neapolitan-style pizza surface in English print in the mid-19th century. 
<a href="foodpies.html#margherita">Pizza Margarita</a>, generally cited as the "first modern pizza" occurred a generation later.
<p>
"...there is no earlier evidence than third century Macedonia for the use of a flat loaf of bread as a
plate for meat, a function which bread continued to perform in the pide of Turkey, the pita of
Greece and Bulgaria, the pizza of southern Italy and the trencher of medieval Europe. Although
meat and other  relishes were seen earlier in Greece as accompaniments to cereal, the cereal had
taken other forms."<br>

"It has been argued that the Italians did not "invent" pizza. Perhaps this is technically true, but
there can be no denying that Italy was most certainly the seedbed out of which the concept would
flourish to the fullest. In one form or another, pizza has been a basic part of the Italian diet since
the Stone Age, and Italians have devised more ways of interpreting the dish than anyone
else...Italian pizza evolved from the basic concepts initiated by two different cultures: the
Etrucans in the north and the Greeks in the south...The earliest pizza prototypes originated when
Neolithic tribes first gathered wild grains, made them into a crude batter, and cooked them on the
hot stones of their campfires...Italians may have made pizza famous, but they certainly did not
invent the concept of the dish...the Greeks, who occupied the southernmost regions of Italy for
over 600 years (from about 730B.C. to 130 B.C.), were the greatest bakers of ancient times...Flat,
round breads were baked with an assortment of "relishes" (in ancient Greek, a relish meant
anything spread or baked on bread), such as oils, onions, garlic, herbs, olives, vegetables, and
cheese, on tip. A rim of crust was left around the bread to serve as a kind of handle..."<br>

"A pizza consists mainly of a flat disc of bread. This is normally the base for various toppings, and
it is safe to assume that since early classical times people in the general region of the
Mediterranean were at least sometimes putting a topping on their flat breads [ie foccacia]...the
word pizza itself  was used as early as the year 997 AD in Gaeta, a port between Naples and
Rome...Abruzzi had something called pizza in the twelfth century. Calabria made <i>pitta</i> or
<i>petta</i>, Apulia <i>pizzella</i> or <i>pizzetta</i>, Sicily <i>sfincione</i>. Tuscany's
<i>schiacciata</i>...was first roasted on stones by the ancestral Etruscans...The

<b>Why do we call it "pizza?"</b><br>
"The origins of its name are not altogether clear. Its extreme similarity to the Provencal pissaladiere, a dough base covered generally with onions, olives, and 
anchovies, would make it tempting to assume that Italian somehow acquired the word from French, were it not for the fact that Italian pizza actually denotes a far
 wider range of items than what English-speakers would recognize as pizza. Essentially it means 'pie', and this can cover for example a cloased fruit pie as well as 
the open pizza. The usual course suggested for it is Vulgar Latin *picea, a dervative of Latin pix, 'pitch' (in which case it would be an amost directly parallel
 formation with English pikelet), but it could also be related to Greek pitta." <br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 259)
<p>
"The term pizza is clouded in some ambiguity, though it may derive from an Old Italian word
meaning a point, which in turn led to the Italian word pizzicare, to pinch or pluck. The word
shows up for the first time in print as a Neapolitan dialect word--piza or picea--about 1000 A.D.,
possibly referring to the manner in which something is plucked from a hot oven...While many
Mediterranean cultures and regions of Italy have long had their versions of flatbreads...the baked
flatbread most people now think of as pizza originated in Naples, and was a favorite snack of
occupying Spanish soldiers at the Taverna Cerriglio in the 17th century. The soft, baked crispy
dough that the Neapolitans called sfiziosa would be folded over into a libretto (little book) and
consumed in the hand. It was baked by men called pizzaioli, who worked in small shops called
laboratori. By the middle of the 19th century the word pizza had become common parlance for
the food item..."<br>

<b>Neapolitan pizza</b><br>
"I refer to the Neapolitan pizza. 'The pizza!' I hear your readers exclaim 'what do you mean by the pizza?' Well, the pizza is a favourite Neapolitan delicacy which is only 
made and eaten between sunset and two or three in the morning, and it must be baked five minutes in the the oven; at the very moment when it is ordered it is pulled out of the
oven and served up piping hot, otherwise it is not worth a grano. The pizza baker takes a ball of dough, kneads it, and speads it out with the palm of his hand, giving it about
 half the thickness of a muffin, then pours over it mozzerella, which is nothing more than rich cream, beaten almost like a cream cheese; then he adds grated cheese, herbs, and 
tomato, puts the cake--which, made after this fashion, is termed pizza--just for five minutes into the oven, and serves it up as hot as possible. The cheese and the cream are of
source all melted, and unite with the herbs and the tomato. The outside crust must, in the case of the perfect pizza, possess a certain orthodox crispness. Now, at this season of the 
year there is no person, high or low, from the first Neapolitan duke to the lowest lazzaroni, with who it is not aprimary article of faith to eat pizza. The pizza cake is your only
social leveller, for in the pizza shops rich and poor harmoniously congregate; they are the only places where the members of the Neapolitan aristocracy--far haughtier than those in any
other part of Italy--may be seen masticating their favourite delicacy side by side with their coachmen, and valets, and barbers. The pizza shops are abou the filthiest
in Naples, and whoever knows Naples will admit that is saying a good deal. They are generally in the meanest alleys and in the midst of the most disreputable quarters. No matter,
 at this season of the year they are thronged all the same. At night, when the exquisites of the first water leave from the San Carlino or from the Sevoto, they both meeet
 at the common centre of attraction in the haunts perfumed by the steaming fragrance of the pizza. There are other modes of preparing the pizza, by the substition of
freshly-caught anchovies, or slices of sausage, or mushrooms for the cream and grated cheese; but the highest authorities on these points treat with disdain all such modern
innovatoins, and protest that a pizza compounded after that fashion has no right ot the name at all. The pizza season is now at its height. Even graceful and elegant duchesses and 
marchionesses exchange the velvet cushions of their opera boxes for the dirty wooden benches or straw-bottomed chairs of the pizza shop. A new feature is at the present moment 
imparted to them by the Garibaldians who, just before starting, by this tribute to Neapolitan fashion, and, like all the rest of the world, find it capital fun to vary the monotomy 
of life by making acquaintance with the pizza."<br>

<b>Pizza alla Margherita?</b><br>
Current popular story credits Raffaele Esposito for "inventing" this pizza, circa 1889. In sum:
"...on June 11, 1889, an official of the Royal Palace asked a local pazaiolo named Raffaele
Esposito to create a special pizza for the visit of King Umberto I's consort, Queen Margherita, to
Capodimonte. Esposito created three examples, but the one most favored by the Queen was made
with ingredients in the three colors (tricolore) of the Italian flag--red (tomato), white (mozzarella)
and green (basil) atop the pizza dough. Esposito quickly named the newly fashionable pizza after
the queen, and thus was born the pizza alla Margherita and that was to become the classic
Neapolitan pizza, recognized as such by the Associazone Vera Pizza Napoletana (The True
Neapolitan Pizza Association)..." <br>
---<i>The Dictionary of Italian Food and Drink</i>, John Mariani [Broadway Books:New York]
1998 (p. 197) 
<p>
Primary evidence suggests this popular story is a fanciful recounting of earlier events:<br>
"Queen Margartet is in Naples at the palace of Capedimonte, and a story is related of her which explains the secret of her popularity among the people. A favorite eatable with the
Neapolitans is the pizza, a sort of cake...that is in a round form, and seasoned with various condiments. The Queen sent for a pizzainolo who is famous for his skill in making
these cakes, as she said 'she wanted to eat like the poor people.' The man went to the palace, was received, and having shown a list of thirty-fie varieties of pizza, was sent to the
royal kitchen to make the kind which the Queen had selected. He made eight which were the ideals of their kind, and the little Prince and his mother found them
excellent, but to eat as the poor people in Naples eat--that is often not all, and is more than could be expected. But she has visited the poor quarter of Naples, and sypathizes with the misery
she seet there."<br>

Pizza was imported to the United States by Italian immigrants. For many years, pizza was mostly
available in cities with large Neapolitan populations [New York, Boston, New Haven,
Philadelphia, Baltimore etc.]. It wasn't until American soldiers returned from WWII that pizza
became a national phenomenon.
<p>
"Pizza came to America at the end of the nineteenth century with immigrants from southern Italy.
Italian immigrants built commercial bakeries and backyard ovens to produce bread they had eaten
in Italy. In addition, Italian bakers used their ovens for flatbreads: northern Italians baked
focaccia, while southern Italians made pizza. Initially, pizza was made by Italians for Italians, but
thy the late 1930s after the Great Depression many Americans were eating pizza in Italian
restaurants and pizzerias on the East and West Coasts...Over time, two basic and distinct styles of
American pizza appeared. A thin-crust pizza, commonly called "East Coast" or "New York"
style, is made with just a few toppings like pizza made in Naples...The crust of thick- or
double-crust pizza, also called "West Coast" style, serves as a foundation for a larger number of
toppings...There are several uniquely American pizzas. Deep dish, or "Chicago style," pizza
originated at Pizzeria Uno...in 1943...California or "gourmet" pizza originated in 1980 at Chez
Panisse, a restaurant in Berkeley, California."<br>

"One of the first pizza sold in the United States was baked some fifty years ago by a 13-year-old
pizzaiuolo named Gennaro Lombardi at 53 1/2 Spring Street in Little Italy section of New
York...Pizza may never replace hot dogs as the great American "bite," but their amazing
acceptance in recent years prompts a question: Why pizza and not, say, Mexican enchiladas? The
guess is that a growing number of Americans of Italian origin aided by advertising and
refrigeration, have made pizza as delectable as such other postwar imports as Lollobrigida. The
entertainment weekly <i>Variety</i>, going gastronomic the other Wednesday, reported that the
"extent to which the pizza pies are replacing hot dogs at drive-ins was demonstrated at the
concession trade show at Allied States Ass'n convention which featured more pizza-making
machines than frankfurter heaters." At the Texas State Fair, largest exhibition of its kind, pizza
evoked great interest on the midway. More inquiries were made about pizza than any other food
with the exception of the "corny dog," the dressed-up hot dog on a stick...
...A Neapolitan pizzaiuolo might be startled by pizza in the United States...At a "pizza bar" in a
large Manhattan department store--where thousands are absorbed weekly by hungry
shoppers--three kinds are for sale: plain pizza (a pie); pizzaret (a muffin), and a best-seller called
the pizza-bagel, created, after some protest, by a turncoat pizzaiuolo from Florida...There are
fresh pizza,
warm-over pizza, refrigerated pizza, warm-over pizza and frozen pizza, selling everywhere from
sidearm joints to pizza palaces. (Though "pizza" means pie or pies, some Americans insist on

"While not yet a bona fide fast food, pizza was soon giving the fast foods run for the consumer's
money. By the mid-1950s, thanks to the popularity of spaghetti and tomato sauce, a taste for a
white farinaceous base slathered in thick and salty tomato sauce had become an integral part of the
American palate. The country was therefore well primed for the invation of pizza....In the
1950s...pizza suddenly burst onto center stage. In part this was because it fit so well in the culture
of the times. It was regarded as an ideal family food, equally acceptable to all ages and both sexes.
Its taste hardly departed from the tried and true, yet its form could be readily accomodated to the
era's newer, more casual way of eating: children's parties and snacking in front of the television
set. The informal, communal way it was eaten in restaurants made it particualrly popular with
teenagers, and by the mid-1950s boisterous "pizza parlors" dotted the main streets of Italian
neighborhoods, their oversized booths for six or eight crammed with voracious young eaters,
while others lounged by the entrance waiting for take-home orders...Pizza also became the hottest
restaurant item of the 1950s because, unlike most pastas, it was not particularly affected by delays
between cooking and eating. This made it ideal for the two main growth sectors in the
television-battered restaurant industry, drive-ins and take home places. By 1956 it had shunted
aside hot
dogs as the most popular item in both. By the late 1960s, American were consuming two billion
pizzas annually."<br>

<b>New York style pizza</b><br>
According to the food historians the introduction of pizza to New York City is attributed to
Gennaro Lombardi when he opened up his pizzeria at 53 1/2 Spring Street in 1905.
<p>
"Legend has it that Neapolitan  pizzailo Raffaele Esposito of the Pizzeria de Pietro was the first
to make a pie with tomato, basil, and mozzarella pizza (the colors of the Italian flag) to honor the 
visit of Queen Margherita, consort of King Umberto I, to Naples in 1889. This thereafter was
called pizza alla margherita and became very popular in that city.<p>
     But the pizza remained a local delicacy until the concept crossed the Atlantic in the memories
of immigrants from Naples who settled in the cities along the Eastern Seaboard, especially in New
York City. The ingredients these immigrants found in their new country differed from those in the
old: In New York there was no buffalo-milk mozzarella, so cows's milk mozzarella was used;
oregeno, a staple southern Italian herb, was replaced in America by sweet marjoram; and
American tomatoes, flour, even water, were different. Here pizza evolved into a large, sheet-like
pie, perhaps eighteen inches or more in diameter, reflecting the abundance of the new
country....The first record of a pizzeria in New York was Gennaro Lombardi's, opened in 1905
on Spring Street, but others quickly followed in the Italian communities around the city. Still,
pizza and pizzerias and, later,  pizza parlors' were little known outside the large cities of the East
until after World War II, when returning American GI's brought back a taste for the pizzas they
had had in Naples along with the assumptions that pizza, like spaghetti and meatballs, was a
typical Italian dish, instead of a regional one."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New
York] 1999 (p. 244)
<p>
"The city's selection of restaurants was enriched by the arrival of immigrants during the late
nineteenth century. The food served in the first Italian restaurants in the city was adapted from
recipes of Naples and Sicily, the home of many Italian immigrants. Pizza was a Neapolitan food
uncommon in most of Italy but popular in New York City after G. Lombardi opened a pizzeria on
Spring Street in 1905."<br>
---<i>The Encyclopedia of New York City</i>, Kenneth T. Jackson editor [Yale University
Press:New Haven] 1995 (p. 1000)

<p>
"New York pizza did not exist before 1905, when Gennaro Lombardi, a Neapolitan immigrant,
began to sell pies in his grocery store in Little Italy. Lombardi's was by most accounts the first
New York pizzeria, and Mr. Lombardi, who hired and trained a series of other immigrants,
became the sturdy tap root of a tree of family and acquaintances that would go on to define great
New York pizza."<br>

deep-dish style pizza. The year? 1943. The restaurant? Pizzeria Uno. Uno's "legend" <a
href="http://www.pizzeriauno.com/legend.html"> here</a>
<p> 
Of course, few foods are truly invented. Pizza was certainly known to Chicago for several decades before the Sewell's opened shop.
Most are creative iterations of existing dishes. There is
some speculation, based on the fact that Chicago-style pizza is thickly-topped and sometimes
served in square pans, that the recipe was influenced by Sicilian cuisine.  Did you know recipes
for tomato pie, both open tarts and double-crust (what we now call "stuffed pizza"), were also
known to American cooks in the early 19th century?

"The pizza...first made its appearance in Chicago around 1912. It was introduced by a man who went around with a pizza filled
basket on his head...At that time there was some doubt whether these pizzas were to be used as shingles or munched."<br>
---"Cold War Looms: Pizza Pie Vs. Hot Dog," Thomas Morrow, <i>Chicago Daily Tribune</i>, August 3, 1954 (p. 18)

<p>
The Windy City's first pizzeria opened at 907 Taylor St. in 1924:<br>
"The only place in Chicago where you can buy Italian pizza is at a little restaurant on Taylor street near Halsted. There you can 
wath Tom Granato, for sixteen years the proprietor of Chicago's only pizzeria, concoct the delicacy  and carefully deposit it in his
big brick oven slipping it off long handled shovels of well sandpapered wood onto the hot bricks. The foundation of pizza is a 
dough similar to that in English muffins. To rolls out  a piece the size of a pie crust on his marble slab, cuts up fresh 
Italian cheese over it, covers it with tomato--the little Italian pear tomato--sprinkles olive oil over it, and deposits 
it in the brick oven for a few minutes. It is served in a tin pie plate, cut into four sections, and eaten with the fingers. Try it with 
a salad. Young Blackie, waiter at Tom's Pizzeria Napolitana, who tells you how Tom and his wife, Molly, took him off the street 
ten years ago, made known the other specialties of the place--stuffed macaroni, eggplant parmigiano, and cannoli, an Italian
 dessert, with sweet, cold Italian cottage cheese served in a fold of ice cream cone like pastry."<br>
---"Front Views and Profiles," June Provines, <i>Chicago Daily Tribune</i>, October 17, 1939 (p. 17)
<p>
The second pizzeria opened (according the general concensus of local food experts), opened on the southwest corner of Onio Street and Wabash
Avenue in 1943:<br>
""When Riccardo opened the Uno, there was only one other place to buy pizza in Chicago and that was on Taylor street," [Ike] 
Sewell said."<br>

<p>
"In 1943 Ike Sewell, a liquor-company executive and former All-American guard from Wills Point, Tex., and Ric Riccardo Sr., an
artist, seaman, apache dancer, and tavernkeeper born in Biella, Italy, decided to team up and open a Mexican restaurant in 
Chicago. A site was leased, and Riccardo began painting bullfights and cockfights on the walls. Sewell was a lover of and an expert
on Mexican cuisine. Riccardo knew nothing about it, and there was no decent place in Chicago (according to Sewell) to taste it. One
of Riccardo's bartenders, a chap named Raoul, offered to cook up a fine Mexican meal. Riccardo ate what Raoul had wrought and 
got violently ill. He painted out the cockfights and bullfights and left to vacation in Italy. Riccardo returned having stumbled
upon a better idea--pizza. Sewell was the one in the dark this time. He had never tasted tht stuff, never even heard of it, but 
agreed with Riccardo that it should serve as a meal not just an appetizer as it was in Italy. They came up with a balance of cheese
and sausage and spices and decreed that it should be used in abundance. They experimented with pans of various sizes and shapes and
came up with the "pizza-in-a-pan" (some call it "deep dish") method of cooking that yielded a crust neither Neopolitan nor Sicilian 
but something else, something brand new. And no one cared. "At first," Sewell said, "we had to cut it into little slivers and give it
away to people who were drinking at the bar." Now, 33 years later, Uno, together with its nearby sister, Pizzeria  Due, seres 2,500
pizzas on a big day...What Sewell and Ruccardon began has been imitated, perhaps improved upon...and occasionally ripped off."<br>
---"Ike and Ric: They were the first with the thickest," <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, August 1, 1976 (p. G16)
<p>
"Mrs. Sewell, 95, whose husband, Ike, gained fame as the co-inventor of deep dish pizza, died
early Sunday morning at her Chicago home. Ike Sewell, along with partner Ric Riccardo Sr., is
credited with inventing deep dish pizza in 1943, but Mrs. Sewell also helped concoct the pizza
that put Chicago on the map, according to Chicago Blackhawks owner Bill Wirtz, a family friend.
"If Ike was the godfather of deep dish pizza, she was the godmother," Wirtz said. Mrs. Sewell
married Ike, a liquor company executive, in 1939, and in the 1940s and '50s helped him with
recipes and decor for his Pizzeria Uno, Pizzeria Due and Su Casa restaurants."<br>

<p>
"What is this pizza called Chicago deep-dish, and what makes it so different from other pizzas? In
the truest sense, deep-dish pizza (pizza-in-the-pan is the alternate nom de pizza) is a
first-generation descendant of what Italian-Americans commonly referred to as "tomato pie." A
sideline of Italian bakeries at the turn of the century, a tomato pie was baked in a large rectangular
pan with 1-inch-high sides. It had a crust two fingers thick and a generous layer of seasoned
tomato puree that was dusted with grated Romano cheese just before it went into the
oven...Chicago-style deep-dish pizza came into being in 1943 when two savvy entrepreneurs, Ike
Sewell and Ric Riccardo, opened Pizzeria Uno on the corner of Wabash and Ohio. It was a time
when a restaurant serving only pizza was unheard of. The story goes that it took six months of
experimentation to produce that "cheese, tomato, and meat pie" called deep-dish pizza. It was so
thick that it required the use of a knife and fork -- which brought down another wall of pizza
tradition: Pizza had always been something that you ate with your hands. Utensils to eat pizza?
Incredible."<br>

<b>Tomato pie</b><br>
19th century American cookbooks offer several recipes for "tomato pie." These were typically green or ripe tomatoes
baked in a traditional pie crust. The tomato was used as any other fruit; sliced and spiced. 
Tomato pie, the pizza from South NJ/Trenton/Philadelphia, evolves from Italian culinary traditions. Tracing the origin and
evolution of this delicious regional specialty takes some sleuthing. Happy to share our notes.

"The pie connoisseurs who have been enumerating and classifying the different brands of pie in print of late have been guilty of a 
grievous omission in leaving out green tomato pie. Like sweet potato pie, the green tomato articled is indigenous to the southern 
section of the great pie belt, but there it is in high favor. There is no geographical reason why it should not become equally 
popular up North. The tomatoes distinguishing it are sliced and stewed in sugar the in a way very taking to the sweet tooth, but they 
must first of all be green. Pie is still hopelessly unfashionable, but now that the doctors have come out with a denial that it is unhealthy, 
it bids fair to be in for a new lease of popularity, in which green tomato pie deserves to be included." <br>

<b>[2010: Trenton Tomato Pie]</b><br>
"Compared to every other kind of pizza, Trenton tomato pies are put together backwards. Cheese and toppings go on first. Only then comes the tomato sauce—seasoned, crushed plum tomatoes, to be precise—spooned on with the individual pizzamaker’s signature flair. 

It wouldn’t be a true tomato pie if there was tomato sauce in every bite, as in a regular pizza. You don’t want sameness in every bite. You want the tomatoes to have a bit of bulk and gather themselves in little red hillocks on the pie. 

“Normally, pizza is coated in cheese, and you take one bite and the cheese all comes off,” says Rick DeLorenzo Jr., who runs DeLorenzo’s Pizza on Hamilton Avenue in Trenton. “With tomato pie, you really taste the tomatoes.”

Nick Azzaro remembers his grandfather, Joe Papa, one of the founding fathers of Trenton pizza, relating a tale that could, in part, account for the nature of the tomato pie. Back in Naples, Azzaro says, “The story was they were making bread, and they put some sliced tomatoes on it, and cooked it, and that was it.”

Papa opened Papa’s Tomato Pies on South Clinton Avenue in 1912, at age 17. He had emigrated from Naples during the prior decade and settled in Trenton in the
 burgeoning Italian neighborhood of Chambersburg. Before launching his own restaurant, he worked at Joe’s Tomato Pies. Joe’s opened in 1910 and is regarded 
as the second pizzeria established in America after Lombardi’s, which opened on Spring Street in Manhattan in 1905."<br>

<b>[2012: Southern New Jersey Style Tomato Pie]</b><br>
"Southern New Jersey Style Tomato Pie. On the surface, this pizza appears similar to the New York style, but there are several distinct differences. Typically dough formulation will not include olive oil. While the hand -stretching method is the same as New York style, this pizza is topped with locally-produced shredded mozzarella before the sauce is applied. Sauce is smooth, but thicker than New York style sauce and is splashed on the pizza randomly, with Romano or domestic Parmesan cheese added on top. The 'cheese first' method produces a crisper crust with creamier melted cheese. Traditional toppings are limited to anchovies, or sliced sausage that is pre-cooked and then distributed on thepizza before baking.
"Philadelphia Style Tomato Pie. While similar in name to the New Jersey pizza, this type is actually quite different. 
Dough is made from all-purpose flour, allowed to ferment and then stretched and placed on a square black steel pan that
 is coated with olive oil or baked directly on the stones of an oil-fired oven. A light sprinkle of shredded mozzarella is 
generously covered by a chunky slow-simmered tomato sauce that contains yellow onion, fresh garlic and a large amount of 
extra virgin olive oil. The pizza is topped with grated Parmigiano Reggiano before baking."<br>

<a name="pissaladiere">
<b>French pizza? Oui!</b><br>
Many people assume <a href="foodpies.html#pizza">pizza</a> originated in Italy. Certainly there is ample
evidence. On
the other hand? Food does not respected man-made political boundaries. Countries sharing
common
borders likewise share similar dishes, ingredients, and flavors. Pizza-type foods are popular
throughout the
Mediterranean region. 
Yes, there is French pizza. It flourishes in the balmy southeast region of the country. The
ingredients are
quite similar to those of neighboring Italy. 
<p>
"Pissaladiere. A specialty of the Nice region, consisting of a flan filled with onions and garnished
with anchovy fillets and black olives. It is traditionally coated with a condiment pissalat before
being cooked, hence the name. A good pissaladiere should have a layer of onions half as thick as
the base if bread dough is used; if flan is made with shortcrust pastry (basic pie dough), the layer
of onions should be as thick as the flan pastry. It can be eaten hot or cold...Pissalat. Also known
as pissala. A condiment originating from the Nice Region, made of anchovy puree flavored with
cloves, thyme, bay leaf and pepper and mixed with olive oil. Originally pissalat was made from the
fry of sardines and anchovies, but because this is not readily available outside the Mediterranean
area, anchovies in brine may be used instead."<br>
---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, completely revised and updated [Clarkson Potter:New York]
2001 (p. 899)
<p>
"A pissaladiere is in effect a Provencal version of the pizza. It consists of a base of bread dough
(or sometimes fried slices of bread) with a savoury topping. Nowadays this is usually onions
stewed in olive oil, or a mixture of tomatoes and anchovies, or a puree of anchovies and
garlic...all threee decorated with black olives, but originally it would have been a mixture of tiny
fish, typically fry of sardines, anchovies, etc., preserved in brine. This was known as pissala
(presumably a derivative of Latin piscis,  'fish'), and gave its name to the pissaladiere. (Despite the
striking similarity, there does not appear to be any direct etymologial link with Italian
pizza.)"<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p.
258)
<p>
"Though the French influence is everywhere in this country, a few foods that are common in
France have managed to escape our dragnet. The French pizza is one example. Yes, pizza.
Although it is most often known as a pissaladiere, it is what it is: a round, flat bread, crisp on the
bottom, simply garnished on top, rustic and yet urbane. Travel through the regions of France with
your eyes open for anything that looks like pizza, and you'll come back impressed not only by
how plentiful these pizzas are but also by their variety. Some, like the galette de Perouges, are
sweet rather than savory. And many of them are served at room temperature. In fact, the pizzas of
France and Italy, despite having different tendencies in herbs and cheese, have more in common
with each other than they do with most of those produced here...The Provencal version of the
pissaladiere is often garnished with two of the region's signature ingredients: black olives and
sliced tomatoes, both in minuscule amounts by our standard. It is usually served at room
temperature as often as not because in Provence, and throughout France, pizza is snack bread.
Because it lacks gobs of cheese congealing on top, it retains its appeal even when cool. It is so
simple--mostly just sweet onions on a wonderful crust. And yet it was so much more.If
pissaladiere is the most familiar of the French pizzas, galette de Perouges is the most surprising.
This is the best-known product of Perouges, a well-preserved and perfectly restored medieval
village not far from Lyons. Although galette is a word used for many free-form tarts in France,
this particular galette seems more familiar than most: a large, round pie, slid into an oven on a
paddle and cut into crisp wedges. On closer inspection, however, and especially on tasting, this is
no common variation on pizza. The crust is rich and sweet--a yeasted dough made with butter and
sugar, and rolled nearly flat. And the topping is butter and sugar; no more. The galette is baked in
a hot oven until the sugar caramelizes and the crust becomes brittle; unlike most pizzas, this
dough is not chewy but crunchy. The tarte flambee of Alsace may be the world's northernmost
indigenous and legitimate pizza. You see it everywhere, although it is most common in the north,
around Strasbourg. Alsace is French, of course, but the food, language and appearance are quite
German in character. In this regional crossroads, there are many variations, based largely on the
background of the baker. Tarte flambee is a bit puffier and less flat than most pizza. Although it is
usually spread with fromage blanc, bacon and onion before baking, there are many variations.
There is a peculiar convention in tarte flambee: Each wedge is rolled from the wide crust end to
its point, and the rolls are eaten end to end. Because French pizzas are so difficult to find outside
France--and are among the easiest of all pizzas to make--it makes sense to try them at
home."<br>

"If your taste runs to pizza, we have some good news and some bad news. As snack foods go, frozen pizza is remarkably nutritious. But judges by CU's test of 41
 products, it isn't apt to be very good. We were disappointed by the crusts, taste or high bacteria counts on all but four brands, and we could rate those bands only Fair. 
Our tests centered on the four most popular pizza styles. We evaluate 17 brands of cheese pizza, 14 of sausage, seven of pepperoni and three topped with hamburger. 
By way of comparison, we also bought and tested at least one sample of fresh pizza in each of those four styles. On average, our frozen pizzas contained a bit more 
dough than a fresh pizza of the same type, and a bit less cheese. The ran neck and neck in the amount of sauce. Our taste-tests indicated though, that liberality or 
stinginess with any given ingredient wasn't a reliable guide to eating quality...Chemical analysis indicated that the samples averaged roughly half water, about 30 per cent
 carbohydrate, 10 per cent protein and, depending on pizza variety, anywhere from 6 1/2 to nine per cent fat. A typical, four-ounce serving would provide 220 to 304 
calories. So, despite their status as a snack food, the pizzas we checked fulfill many of the nutritional requirements of a main dish...pizza's balanced protein-calorie
 relationship, uncommon in a snack food, might well promote the use of pizza as a meat substitute in your meal now and then...Pizza's main pitch for the buyer's dollar is 
based on sensory appeal. Accordingly, CU's food technologists evaluated from three to six samples of each frozen pizza fro flavor, aroma, texture and 
appearance...Unfortunately, very few crusts filled the bill even well enought to be rated Fair...No CU food project would be complete without a close look at product 
cleanliness. We accordingly analyzed duplicate samples of every product for viable microbes. Our first effort was a total bactyeria count per gram of pizza. That's usually a 
pretty good indicator of a food's sanitary status...our findings were far from reassuring...To be fair, such a dismal bateriological showing doesn't necessarily mean that a
 food is leaving the factory in filthy condition. Those bacteria can thrive at freezing temperatures will get a chance to increase inordinately in a pizza that's mishandled or
 stays overlong in a retail showcase...A check of the pizzas for extraneous matter also yielded disquieting results--about 96 per cent of the samples tested contained
 some quantity of insects or insect fragments. Those unsavory intruders turned up in every brand, and represent a higher level of such contamination than we have found in
 any other food category...As far as taste goes, we think most would do well to buy a freshly cooked pizza at a pizza parlor they know to be good and freeze it
 themselves..."<br>

<br>
Dishing out the history of pork pies is quite the challenge for any food historian. The practice of encasing sweet or savory
minced contents in pastry (aka <a href="foodpies.html#aboutpie">"pie"</a> dates to Medieval times. Early recipes varied according to culture, cuisine,
and Christian season (Lent, Christmas). They often combined meat with fruit (apples, raisins) and spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, etc.)
Pork, being a versatile and common fall-ready meat, was often employed as pie filling. 
Popular regional versions are Old World <a href="foodpies.html#cheshire">Cheshire</a>, New World <a href="#capebreton>Cape Breton</a> & 
French-Canadian 
<a href="foodpies.html#tourtiere">Tourtiere</a>. From this
tradition sprang two primary recipe lines: savory raised pies and sweet compact 
<a href="christmasfood.html#mincemeat">mincemeat</a> dishes. <a href="http://www.mmppa.co.uk/howtotell.html">Melton Mowbray Pork Pies</a>
are protected by EU law. Some modern pork pies don't contain any pork at all.
<p>
"The British pork pie...are survivals of the medieval tradition of raised pies, and have changed surprisingly little. This particular
pie, simply known as 'pork pie', is of a form distinct from other pies which merely happen to be made with pork. The filling is of
fresh pork without other major ingredients, seasoned with salt, pepper, and a small quantity of herbs, especially sage. 
At Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire, long famous for its pork pies, anchovy essence was added not only for its flavour but
because it was thought to give the meat an attractive pink colour, while pies from other districts were brownish or greyish."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2nd edition, 2006 (p. 625)
<p>
<b>Sweet vs savoury?</b><p>
"By the middle of the seventeenth century, pies had become a peculiarly Engish specialty; even the French were prepared to concede
superiority.  By the time [Eliza] Smith was writing, they had a long an honourable past, and were thus less susceptible to 
foreign influences than the made dishes at which the French were held to excel. If it is true that there was a parallel trend in
both countries towards separating savory from sweet, it is not surprising that the English pies should have followed the 
general movement, but it is noticeable that they did so very much more slowly than made dishes. English books of the eighteenth
century contain many receipts for meat pies with sweet and sour elements...What is perhaps the best-known English mixture of meat
and sugar, the mince-pie, retained this combination until well into the nineteenth century, and survives, without the lean meat but
with beef suet, to our own day. But even in the area of pies, the distinction between sweet and savory was beginning to operate and was 
visible in English texts before 1700. A sweet element, either sugar or dried fruit, was almost always present in Markham's 
receipts...The distinction between savoury and sweet pies did not become really obvious in the cookery books until around
1720. The cooks closest to French culinary practice removed the sugar entirely...E. Smith gave pies with chicken and with lamb in 
both savoury and sweet versions, but allowed the confustion of flavours to persist in her vegetable and mince pies--in other words,
those where the sweet-savoury association lingered the longest."<br>

<b>Selected 19th century British recipes</b>
<blockquote>
<b>[1861] <br>
"PORK PIES (Warwickshire Recipe).</b><br>
835. INGREDIENTS.—For the crust, 5 lbs. of lard to 14 lbs. of flour, milk, and water. For filling the pies, to every 3 lbs. of meat allow 1 oz. of salt, 2–1/4 oz. of pepper, a small quantity of cayenne, 1 pint of water.
Mode.—Rub into the flour a portion of the lard; the remainder put with sufficient milk and water to mix the crust, and boil this gently for 1/4 hour. Pour it boiling on the flour, and knead and beat it till perfectly smooth. Now raise the crust in either a round or oval form, cut up the pork into pieces the size of a nut, season it in the above proportion, and press it compactly into the pie, in alternate layers of fat and lean, and pour in a small quantity of water; lay on the lid, cut the edges smoothly round, and pinch them together. Bake in a brick oven, which should be slow, as the meat is very solid. Very frequently, the inexperienced cook finds much difficulty in raising the crust. She should bear in mind that it must not be allowed to get cold, or it will fall immediately: to prevent this, the operation should be performed as near the fire as possible. As considerable dexterity and expertness are necessary to raise the crust with the hand only, a glass bottle or small jar may be placed in the middle of the paste, and the crust moulded on this; but be particular that it is kept warm the whole time.
Sufficient.—The proportions for 1 pie are 1 lb. of flour and 3 lbs. of meat.
Seasonable from September to March..."
<p>
<b>LITTLE RAISED PORK PIES.</b><br>
836. INGREDIENTS.—2 lbs. of flour, 1/2 lb. of butter, 1/2 lb. of mutton suet, salt and white pepper to taste, 4 lbs. of the neck of pork, 1 dessertspoonful of powdered sage.
Mode.—Well dry the flour, mince the suet, and put these with the butter into a saucepan, to be made hot, and add a little salt. When melted, mix it up into a stiff paste, and put it before the fire with a cloth over it until ready to make up; chop the pork into small pieces, season it with white pepper, salt, and powdered sage; divide the paste into rather small pieces, raise it in a round or oval form, fill with the meat, and bake in a brick oven. These pies will require a fiercer oven than those in the preceding recipe, as they are made so much smaller, and consequently do not require so soaking a heat.
Time.—If made small, about 1–1/2 hour.<br>
Seasonable from September to March."<br>

"Pork Pies.</b>--Pork pies are generally made of the trimming taken from a hog when it is cut up. Make and shape the pies according to the directions given in the 
following recipe, and remember that the pies must be moulded while the paste is warm, and that they are much more easily made with a mould than without one. As
 a mould is not always at hand, those who are note particularly expriernced in the work (and it requires skill) may mould the pie round a jelly-pot or bottle, which 
has beeen made warm by beining immersed for some time in warm water. Cut the meat into pieces the size of a small nut, and keep the meat and fat separate. 
Season the whole with pepper and salt, half a dozen young sage-leaves finely shred; or a tea-spoonful of dried and powdered sage, one ounce of salt, two and a 
quarter ounces of pepper, and a pinch of cayenne, may be allowed for a pie containing three pounds of meat. Pack the fat and lean closely into the pie in alternate
 layers until it is filled. Put on the cover, press and pinch the edges, and ornament according to taste. Brush over with well-beaten egg, and bake in a slow oven, as 
the meat is solid and requires to be soaked thorugh. Neither water nor bone should be put into pork pies, and the outside pieces will be hard unless they are cut
 small and pressed closely together. The bones and trimmings of the pork may be stewed to make gravy, which should be boiled until it will jelly when cold, and 
when this has been nicely flavoured, a little may be poured into the pie after it is baked through an opening made in the top. When pies are made small they require 
a quicker oven than large ones. Time to bake, about two hours for a pie containing three pounds. Probable cost, 3s." <br>
---<i>Cassell's Dictionary of Cookery with Numerous Illustrations</i> [Cassell, Petter, Galpin & Co.:London] 1875 (p. 610) 
<p>
"Pork Pies, Pastry for.--Put a quarter of a pound of finely-shred beef suet--or five ounces of lard, or a quarter of a pound of mutton suet--and an ounce of fresh
 butter into a saucepan with half a pint of boiling water and a pinch of salt. Stir the mixture until the fat is dissolved, and pour it boiling hot into a pound and a half of
 flour. Knead well to a stiff paste, and add a little more warm water if required. Shape the dough, and get it into the oven while it is warm. If the pie is to be baked
 in a mould, lay a piece of the proper shape in the bottom. Press long pieces into the sides, and fasten thesee to the top and the bottom with white of egg. If a mould 
is not to be used, cut off as much apstry as will make the cover, and wrap it in a cloth to keep warm. Mould the rest with both hands into the shape of a cone, and
 make the sides smooth and firm. Press the top down with the knuckles of the right hand, and with the left press the outside closely to keep it firm and smooth. Be 
careful that the walls are equlally thick in every part. Fill the pie, put on the cover, pinch the edges, fasten securely with white of egg, ornament the outside in any
 wan thay may suit the fancy, brush over with yolk of egg, and bake in a slow oven if the pie be large, in a quicker one if it be small." <br>

<b>[1894] <br>
"Pork Pie, Raised.</b>--Those who kill pigs of their own have no trouble in obtaining suitable pie meat; those who buy it should be careful to get the best quality, 
and to see that it is free from the slightest taint, every slice being carefully looked over. Required: for a medium-sized pie, a pound and a half of pork, the same 
weight of paste, about a teaspoonful and a half of salt, or, for some, two teaspoonfuls will be none too much, nearly as much pepper, and herbs if approved, and a
 little gravy. Cost, about 7d. per pound. 
The meat should be fairly fat, and is best from a bacon pig, but the loin or neck of pork may be used; the foreloin is preferred by many. Cut into dice (by means of a 
mincer, or by hand), the pieces bieng even in size, the fat and lean mixed will, and the seasoning thoroughly blended with the meat; the meat should be sprinkled with
 a spoonful of water or stock during the mixing, as it tends to bind it. Full directions for the raising of the paste will be found on page 785, and either of the reicpes 
on page 748 may be followed in making it; the medium paste is suitable. Those who possess moulds sometimes prefer a pork pie raisied by hand, and baked out of
 a mould, as the consider the flaour is better. The meat should be packed in firmly, and the lid put on after the inner edges have been egged over; the edges should 
be crimped with the paste nippers (opage 741), and leaves put round the side and on the lid; make a hole or two, and put a centre ornament of paste or not, as
 preferred. Then egg the pie over, and put in a good oven. (See the directions for RAISED PIES, page 785). This will take about two to two and a half hours; the
 latter will not be too long in most cases, and a skewer should be passed into the middle of the meat to test it. The gravy should be made from the bones and any
 skinny and gristly parts of the meat, seasoned as required, and strenghthened with gelatine or meat of a gelatinous sort; the liquor form boiled pork should be used 
in place of water at the start, should any be handy; supposing, for instance, the feet and ears of a pig to have been boiled, there is in the liquor a good foundation for
 the gravy of the pie. 
NOTE.--Should herbs be used, any of those named under PORK SAUSAGES in a previous chapter will answer; but sage is generally liked. If fresh, about half a
 teaspoonful would be enough to flavour the above for most people. Doupble the quantity of dried sage could be suet. We may mention that at a certain farmhouse
 in the Midlands, the pork pies are always made with layers of stoned raisins betweent the layers of pork. We never met with these pies elsewhere, but can 
recommend them." <br>

<b>Cheshire Pork Pie</b><br>
Cheshire Pork Pie descends from the long and venerable line of English meat pies. Food historians traces these dishes to 
the Middle Ages, if not before. 
Ingredients, cooking methods and size vary according to place and period. The pairing of 
<a href="foodfaq.html#applesauce">pork and apples</a> is ancient. <a href="christmasfood.html#mincemeat">Mincemeat pies</a> are closely
related. 
<p>
"Cheshire Pork and Apple Pie. Since I wrote about this pie some years ago, readers have occasionally queried its status as a raised pe. Unless the pastry walls are
 thick, the juice burst out and spoil its appearance...So I returned to Hannah Glasse. Her instructions are vague, but it is placed among the dish pies (raised pies 
start six recipe later). Later in the book she gives instructions for a Cheshire pork pie to be made at sea, with salt pork, and potatoes instead of apples; and this pie 
is clearly a double crust pie made in a dish. The question remains, should the pie be eaten hot or cold? By its position, I would say hot, like the chicken pie before it,
 and the Devonshire squab pie that follows. But it tastes so good cold. By leaving the pie for 24 hours, you wil find that the flavours blend together in the most 
delicious way.

the pork. The peel, core and slice the apples and arrange them on the meat; scatter with a little brown sugar; the amount depends on the sweetness of the apples, 
but it should not be overdone. Repeat the layers until the ingredients are used up. Dot the top with butter--about 60g (2 oz)--and pour on the alcohol. Cover with 
pastry in the usual way, and brush with beaten egg or top of the milk. Bake at mark 7, 220 degrees c (425 degrees F), for 20-30 minutes, then lower the heat to

<b>Cape Breton Pork Pie</b><br>
Food historians tell us traditional European <a href="foodpies.html#porkpies">pork pies</a> date to medieval times. Modern Cape Breton pork 
pies, however, are different. Why? Pork is not an ingredient. Recipes suggest this item evolved from the
<a href="christmasfood.html#mincemeat">mincemeat/mince pies</a> tradition. 
<p>
<b>Why are they called pork pies when they have no pork?</b><br>
Excellent question. Up until the 20th century, lard and suet were common ingredients in
pies and pie crusts. In the Old World beef suet was the norm. In the New World hogs were
plentiful. It is quite likely the original Cape Breton pork pies employed lard from these animals. 
Now butter and other shortenings are used, thus rendering the moniker "pork pies" a delicious

<a name="tourtiere">
<b>Tortiere</b><br>
French Canadian Tourtiere descends from festive medieval European <a href="foodpies.html#porkpies">meat pies</a> featuring pork. 
This recipe, similar to the casserole, was named after its baking receptical. Recipes vary according to period, place and taste. 
<p> 
"A tourtiere is a shallow meat pie with onions, often flavoured with the traditional French medieval spice combo of cinnamon and 
cloves. In kitchens along the majestic Saguenay River, a tourtiere can be quite a production, consisting of cubed meat, potatoes, onions 
baked in many layers in a deep, pastry-lined casserole: in other words, what would have been called a cipaille or pate de famille 
in older days is here a tortiere de Saguenay. In 1836 in Quebec, a tourtiere was a pork pie. One local tourtiere became a 
favourite of Scottish and British soldiers posted to the citadel at Quebec City who then stayed on, buing outskirt farms and growing 
oats. Thus, in one Quebec City tourtiere oatmeal thickens the ground pork filling instead of the traditional French 
potatoes. The food tourtiere took its name from the utensil in which it was baked, The original tourtiere, in French print by 1573, was 
a pie pan for baking tourtes. In old French cookery, a tourte was a round pastry pie with a pastry top and filled either with meat and 
vegetables if it was a savoury or with fruit and cream if it was a dessert tourte. This word stems form the street Latin phrase totus panis 
'a round of bread.' The word tourtiere also names the mould used to make these pastry tourtes. This tourtiere has an expandable 
circumference, can be made of porcelain, clay, or glass, and can serve as a pie dish, a tart mould, or a flan ring." <br>

[NOTE: No recipe included.] 
<p>
"Tourtiere. A hundred years ago, the tourtiere was a must on every Christmas table. It can also be served in small tartlets as an 
apertif. You can find almost as many Quebec tourtiere recipes as there are cooks, since each one has her own ways and variation... 
Tourte de Noel. The pastry for the tourte is very special, and different from the tourtiere type. It is rich, flaky, light and always 
flavored with savory. In the old days wild savory was gathered in the autumn and hung on the kitchen rafters to dry until 
Christmas. The tourte is quite different from the tourtiere." <br>
---<i>The Canadiana Cookbook</i>, Mme. Jehane Benoit [Pagurian Press Ltd.:Toronto] 1970 (p. 24-25) 
<p>
"Tourtiere. Food historians like to explain the name of Quebec's meat pie, some tracing it to the French cooking utensil of the 
same name, others to a passenger pigeon called the 'toure' or 'oiseau blan,' which was plentiful in eastern Canada into the 
20th century. The birds, gamey in flavour like grouse or pheasant, were unafraid of man, Montrealer Louis Amos told me, quoting 
his grandfather. If farmers scattered corn on a field, a flock would come to feed and it would be possible to kill them with clubs or trap 
them under a net. The birds could be plucked, cleaned, and preserved in brine for winter meals, and sometimes mixed with pork, beef, and 
seasonings to make a tourtiere. Around 1920, so his story goes, a severe storm blew the last flock of the birds out to sea, never to 
return. 'That's the folklore,' he said." <br>

The practice of crafting small, stuffed pastries dates back to ancient times. The beauty
of these
self-contained foods was they were easy to cook, inexpensive, portable and could be consumed
anywhere with minimal mess. Many cultures developed similar foodstuffs. Pastry dough,
fillings, and shapes varied according to region, religion, and seasonal availability. Like <a href="foodfaq1.html#dumplings">dumplings</a>, portable pies are a true universal
recipe, spanning all periods and points of the globe.

<b>General history notes from the food historians:</b><p>
"There is reason to believe that [sanbusak] is the progenitor of the empanada and calzone.
Sanbusak, an Arabic word that comes from the Persian sanbusa, meaning anything triangular, was
first described as a stuffed pastry in the early ninth century by Ishaq ibn Ibrahim (d. 851), a well
known author from Iraq...In a thirteenth-century Arabic cookery book of al Baghdadi, sanjusaj is
described as a stuffed triangular pastry fried in sesame oil...By the thirteenth century, sanbusak
appears in Spain, almost as the same recipe, a triangular fried pastry."<br>
---<i>A Mediterranean Feast</i>, Clifford A. Wright [William Morrow:New York] 1999 (p. 573)
<p>
Craig Claiborne sums this topic nicely:<p>
"Turnovers, which are festive and are almost infinate in their variety, also pinpoint to a degree the
migrant influences in America. Just consider their backgrounds: There are Cornish pasties, which
indicate the early presence of Welsh miners in Michigan, the Mexican-influenced empanadas and
empanaditas of the West and Southwest, and the curiously named hot-ta-meat pies of Louisiana
that indicate a borrowing from the Spanish. Even spring rolls--the more refined version of egg
rolls, which can most certainly be classified as turnovers--can be found almost anywhere in the
nation where Chinese chefs have settled. 
     Where American history is concerned, I find the Cornish pasties the most interesting, not
because of their flavor especially but because of the uses to which they have been put in this
country. The concept was brought here in the late 1700s and early 1800s with the influx of miners
from Wales...Once the pasties were established in this country, it did not take long for the
non-Welsh of the region to take to them with relish and add a distinctly American touch..."<br>

"A turnover is a sort of small, typically individual pie or pasty, in which the filling is placed on one
side of a piece of rolled-out pastry and the other side is then  turned over' to cover it, forming a
semicircular shape. The term is first recorded at the end of the eighteenth century:  an old woman
preparing her turnovers, commonly called apple-pies' (<i>Sporting Magazine</i>, 1798). It is
occasionally used for savoury fillings, such as meat, but a sweet fruit filling is the norm, and, as
the above extract suggests, most turnovers are in fact apple turnovers."<br>

 the other half turned over it; a child's sweetmeat resembling this. Also attrib. as turn-over shop.

<b>What were the first Pop Tart flavors?</b><br>
According to an Kellogg's advertisement published in the Los Angeles Times October 28, 1965 (p. D15): blueberry, strawberry, apple-currant
and brown sugar-cinnamon. The ad reads "New Pop Tarts drop'em into the toaster or eat'em just as they are. A wonderful breakfast treat-
grand for lunch or snacks too. We call 'em Kellogg's Pop-Tarts. Tasty, tender pastries--four kinds--each ready-filled with a
different and luscious flavor...You'll call 'em the most convenient, tasty change-of-pace breakfast idea that's come along to

fresh without refrigeration. A nourishing all-family treat for lunch boxes and after-school snacks as well as for breakfast
." [NOTE: the ad also mentions Smuckers brand jelly and preserves was used for the filling.]
<p>
<b>Product introduction and marketing strategy</b><br>
Our research confirms Kellogg's was not the first to bring a toaster pastry to market. It was, however the most successful.
<p>

"On Feb. 16, 1964, Post unveiled its new product, Country Squares. The food industry oohed and aahed; the business press buzzed; grocers waited expectantly.
And waited. But Post was slow getting Country Squares onto store shelves. "They kept fooling around with it in our labs," recalls Stan Reesman, a retired Post food technician who invented the cereal Fruity Pebbles.
In September 1964, just six months after the public unveiling of Country Squares, Kellogg introduced Pop-Tarts in several test markets around the country. Reesman insists Country Squares were superior, but he says, "We could see the handwriting on the wall."
The names given to the two products were one more indication of Kellogg's superior marketing savvy. Kellogg appreciated that kids were the primary target 
audience for Pop-Tarts because they had yet to establish breakfast habits of their own. Post seems to have been more confused. As awful a name as Country 
Squares seems in 1994, it was arguably worse in 1964, when the word "square" was widely used to mean "nerdy." When paired with "country," it seemed to 
describe a food for middle-age rubes from the sticks...Once Pop-Tarts were in the markeplace, Kellogg threw its full marketing muscle behind them. With huge revenue from its cereals at its disposal, Kellogg was sponsoring a whole zoo of kids' shows, includng Yogi Bear, Woody Woodpecker, Huckleberry Hound, Atom Ant, Bugs Bunny, Mighty Mouse and Secret Squirrel. Pop-Tarts quickly joined the cast of sugared cereals being hawked between cartoons.
Kellogg had won the toaster-pastry game in the first inning. By 1967, toasted pastries were a $45 million market, most of which belonged to Kellogg. Post's Country Squares had evolved into Post Toast-Em Pop-Ups, but Post finally gave up and sold the marketing rights in the early 1970s. General Mills' Toastwich, which had to be refrigerated, appeared on grocery shelves for less than a year.
Nabisco's Toastettes, which debuted in 1967, have survived and were recently repositioned, according to a Nabisco spokesman, meaning they now come eight to
 a box and can be microwaved. This is not an advantage to be scoffed at; microwave a Pop-Tart and it resembles nuclear waste. But Pop-Tarts continue to 
dominate the toaster-pastry category, although significantly lower-priced generic brands are widely available."<br>
---"Toasting of an Icon the Pop-Tart marks 30 Years as Part of American Life," Steve Hymon, <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, September 25, 1994 (p. 1)
<p>

"After gaining market share in sales in cereal, Kellogg searched for related breakfast items that
could both draw on and complement the recent success in breakfast cereals. The company settled
on a food of taste and convenience, the toaster pastry. "Toaster pastries joined the breakfast
line-up in 1964 as Kellogg's Pop-Tarts," according to a company pamphlet. Pop-Tarts
represented
both a diversification from cereal and an expansion of the cereal line into a breakfast line...When
Kellogg's Pop-Tarts were introduced, ads highlighted the item's convenience and often featured
"Milton the Toaster." Advertisements also consisted of the full brand name and the slogan "drop
 em into the toaster-or eat  em just as they are." printed across the side of the toaster with
Pop-Tarts popped up. Pop-Tarts were marketed than and now as a food of convenience and a
snack of
nutrition...Kellogg's marketing strategy of claiming nutrition for Pop-Tarts is a part of the larger,
historic strategy to market Pop-Tarts to adults as well as children. Hoping to appeal to grown-up
baby boomers as well as today's children and adolescents, Kelloggs continues to direct marketing
schemes for pre-sweetened cereals and Pop-Tarts to all age groups..."<br>

<b>CALZONES</b><br>
 Regarding the origin of calzones there are a couple of theories:<p>

"Calzone means "pant leg" in Italian. Calzone are usually associated with Naples, where they can
also be made with sausage and mozzarella cheese, but are found, famously, throughout southern
Italy, sometimes deep-fried. Every town has its own variation...Carol Field, author of several
books on Italian food, suggests that calzone may have existed in medieval Latin as early as 1170,
according to a reference in Padua, although the historian Luigi Sada, also the author of several
Apulian cookbooks, suggests a statute from Bisceglie around 1400 as being the first appearance
of the word. Chef Carlo Middione, the author of <i>The Food of Southern Italy</i>, makes the
plausible suggestion of a Muslim introduction in medieval Arab times. If this is true, then the
calzone, not to mention the empanada, is related to the old fried pastry of the medieval Arab
world,  sanbusak....Sanbusak, an Arabic word that comes from Persian sanbusa, meaning
anything triangular, which was first described as a stuffed pastry in the early ninth century by
Ishaq ibn Ibrahim...a well-known author from Iraq."<br>
---<i>A Mediterranean Feast</i>, Clifford A. Wright [Morrow:New York] 1999 (p. 563, 573)
<p>
"Calsones...a Sephardic Jewish stuffed pasta which is widely consumed in the Middle East. They
may be square in shape like ravioli or in half-moon or oblong shapes. Calsones are mostly home
made, using egg in the dough, and usually filled with a cheese and egg mixture. Calsones with
reshteh were a famous Jewish dish in Aleppo, Syria. The calsones and reshteh were mixed
together, dressed with melting butter, and served with yoghurt. As for the origins of calsones,
Claudia Roden [in her book <i>The Book of Jewish Food</i>, 1996] suggests that they came to
the
Aleppo community with the Italian Jews who left Italy at various times, beginning in the 16th
century, when there was a mass emigration eastwards following the expulsion of Jews from Italy."<br>

<a name="stromboli">
<b>STROMBOLI</b><br>
How old is stromboli & where did it originate? Excellent questions! Italian food history books/cookbooks are curiously silent
on this topic. This suggests an Italian-American genesis. South Philadelphia is generally regarded as the American epicenter for
this delcious dish. Our survey of historic newspapers confirms stromboli piqued the palates of mainstream America in the 1990s.
<p>
"Stromboli. A sandwich made with pizza dough folded over a variety of ingredients, most often
mozzarella and sliced pepperoni. The stromboli is a specialty of Philadelphia, though similar to
an Italian confection called the calzone...The name may derive from the Italian island of
Stromboli, but more probably refers to a very big, strong character in the fairy tale The
Adventures of Pinocchio (1882) by Carlo Lorenzini, whose pen name was "Collodi." <br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Freidman:New York]
1999 (p. 313)
<p>
"Stromboli is a crusty brown, overstuffed loaf dish which is popular in several US regions with numerous Italian-American residents. The of the term  remains 
uncertain although there is a resort island near Sicily which is called Any stuffing can be used for such as cold cuts, cheese, roasted peppers, vegetables, among 
others. The dish is a welcome addition to Italian menus that usually offer pizza and pasta. Stromboli is a resort island off the coast of Sicily that features an active 
smoldering volcano. Stromboli (the dish) isn't that hot on this side of the Atlantic, but in Philadelphia, Providence, R.I., New York City, and other places with 
established Italian-American communities, it's a long-standing favorite. How the crusty brown, overstuffed loaf became known as "stromboli" is anyone's guess,
 since there's no food by that name in Italy. Perhaps the moniker was tagged on by an immigrant baker with a knack for marketing. What we do know about it is 
that virtually any stuffing goes--from cold cuts and cheese to roasted peppers and other vegetables--and that it's the ideal do-ahead food to feed a crowd or a
 single diner, to take out or eat in, and to build add-on sales. A likely forebear is the Sicilian 'nfigghiulata antica, which Carlo Middione details in <i>The Food of
 Southern Italy</i>... It's a rolled bread filled with ground veal and pork, Swiss chard, cauliflower, provolone, and black olives, shaped like a crescent 
to recall the Arab domination of Sicily. We also know that stromboli can go by different names. Shops around New Haven, Conn., for example, make
 "broccoli bread" stuffed with the vegetable and Italian sausage. What distinguishes the stromboli from its better-known cousin calzone is its multiple-serving loaf 
shape. Calzones are more apt to take the form of individual pizza-dough turnovers."<br>

<a name="empanadas">
<b>EMPANADAS</b><br>
Empanadas are considered part of the gastronomic history of Spanish Galicia. The Empanada
Festival is one of this region's  major annual events. These portable pies were introduced to the
"New World" by Spanish explorers and missionaries.
<p>
"Empanadas, meat and fish pies from Galicia, are rarely found elsewhere in Spain. One
explanation for the popularity of empanadas in Galicia is that they suit the character of these
northern peoples, for the pies hide their contents from public view, just as the Gallegos often
remian aloof and secretive. The idea may be a bit farfetched, but there is little doubt that Gallegos
make better meat pies than anyone else, using fillings as varied as the produce of Galicia. Most
empanadas contain lots of onion and green or red pepper, in combination with meat or fish. The
doughs take many different forms, from puff pastry to those made with cornmeal. There are other
areas of Spain known for their pies, but these are called pasteles instead of empanadas."<br>
---<i>The Foods and Wines of Spain</i>, Penelope Casas [Alfred A. Knopf:New York] 1982 (p.
52)<br>
[NOTE: Ms. Casas mentions on p. 64 of this book that Empanada de Lomo (pork pie) is the most
commonly prepared Galician pie.]
<p>
"Empanada. A Spanish and Latin American savoury turnover.  Empanada' means  covered with
bread'; and bread dough may be used, but the usual covering is shortcrust pastry. Often the
semicircular seam is decorated by twisting it at regular intervals. The pastry may be baked or deep
fried. Fillings vary from one country or region to another. In Spain a mixture of minced meats and
sausage is common, but in writing about empanadas in Galicia Janet Mendel [<i>Traditional
Spanish Cooking</i>, Garnet Publishing, 1996] lists no fewer than 18 examples of fillings,
ranging from clams to rabbit, sardines to pigeon, and octopus to ham. In S. And C. America and
the southwest of the USA a similarly wide range of fillings are used. Mexican fillings are highly
seasoned with chilli peppers."<br>

"The meat pie's origins are shrouded in history, lost in the days when Indian met Spaniard in the forests around the oldest settlement in the Louisiana Purchase. But
 James Lasyone is sure of at least two things. People were making and selling meat pies around Natchitoches when he took his first steps off the farm nearly half a 
century ago. And today he sells nearly 160,00 of the delicacies every hear. 'My family was sharecroppers,' said Lasyone, who started Lasyone's Meat Pie Kitchen 
with a one-eyed gas stove and a single iron pot. 'We walked into town on Saturdays and there would be people with little carts, pushing them up and down the 
street. I talk to people that's much older and as far back as they can remember they've had meat pies. But until I opened my kitchen here, people made them in 
their homes and sold them in their homes.' The Meat Pie Kitchen in an old downtown strip along the Cane River has become something of a landmark in recent 
years--a haven for busloads of tourists, as well as for travelers armed with ice chests for long-distance takeout orders. 'Travel agencies call us from all over the 
United States...We have buses booked year-round.'...According to Lasyone, the meat pies are tasty--even to strangers from Boston, Spokane or Sault Ste. 
Marie. 'First they want to see one...They of course they still don't know anything. But 95 percent will take the meat pie lunch and the majority are well pleased with
 it.' Like Col. Sanders and others who found a recipe for success, Lasyone is tight-lipped about exactly what goes into his product. He will let on that 50 pounds of
 beef is mixed with 10 pounds of pork, that the fried pastry is something between a turnover and a taco and that a Louisiana-style dark gravy is added to the 
mixture at the end of the cooking process. Beyond those slivers of guidance, however, Lasyone is silent...Despite his sense of ownership, Lasyone insisted he was

<b>CORNISH PASTIES</b><br>
These traditional Welsh meat-filled pies often served as a miner's lunch. When these laborers came
to America to work the copper mines, they brought lunch with them. Efficient & portable, easily re-heated & ultimately
delicious. Foods like these transcend time and place. If you have the opportunity to taste the real thing NEVER
pass it up. After the experience, you will know why.

<blockquote>
<b>[1894]<br>
"Cornish Pasties.</b><br>
These are made in Cornwall and taken by the miners for dinner. There are various combinations used in their concoction, the most common being a
mixture of meat and some vegetable of a moist sort, so that they shall contain plenty of gravy. Mutton, and onions or turnips, or both; beef, with one of these vegetables; 
pork, with apples; or a mixture of meats with any vegetables to had are also used. The paste is of suet as a rule, and is very nice when eaten hot, but when cold is apt to be 
hard, and for that reason a short paste, such as NO. 1 or 2, will be better. This is to be rolled about half an inch thick, as the pasties are substantial, and want
a moderate oven only that the meat may cook. To make the pasties, cut the meat up very small, and the more tender it is the better; indeed, if it is hard the 
pasties are very indigestible. Then put an equal weight of the vegetable--we recommend a mixture of onion and potato, both scalded and chopped up--season 
with salt ahed pepper, then roll the paste out in rounds and put some of the meat in the centre; bring the edges up, after moistening them, and press them together; then take the thumb and finger of 
the right hand and pinch them up, using the forefinger of the left hand to press the paste between them. The sizes of these must be in proportion to the appetite of those who
east them; from four to siz counces in weight is an average size. Then lay them on a greased tin and bake from thirty to forty minutes. They may be
washed over with a little milk when nearly done, or with egg for a better dish...This is the common mode. We advise for a much nicer dish that
the meat be cut up as finely as possible, or passed through a mincer as for sausage meat. When turnips are used they should be partly cooked 
beforehand, and many will like the pasties better if both onions and turnips are parboiled, although this is a departure 
from the original. Imitation Cornish pasties are made by taking some underdone cold meat, with vegetables of any sort, fully
cooked, and adding a little gravy to moisten, with seasoning to taste; the paste for these may be better, and can be rolled
 thinner, and the pasties, if made small, will be baked in about twenty minutes. Bacon can be put with these, ir a mixure of that and 
cooked rice or macaroni can be used. Cost, variable; about 2d. each for pasties for one person."<br>

<B>SAUSAGE ROLLS</b><br>
Modern British sausage rolls descend from the venerable culinary tradition of <a href="foodpies.html#portable">personal-size 
savory pies</a>. Portable and practical, economical and filling. Products vary according to taste, place, and economic status. Prime British examples include grand Medieval mince pies, middle class Victorian Toad-in-the-holes, miner's Cornish pastys, and elegant Beef Wellingtons. Other cultures & cuisines have produced similar foods for similar reasons. About portable pie:http://foodtimeline.org/foodpies.html#portable 
The earliest print recipes we're finding for British Sausage Rolls date to the late 19th century.

<blockquote>
<b>[1875] </b><br>
"Sausage Rolls.</b>--Take half a sausage cut lengthwise for each roll. Enclose the half in pastry six inches square and an
 eighth of an inch thick. Pinch the edges down securely, and then bake the roll on a baking sheet in a well-heated oven. 
They may be served hot or cold. Or take equal weights of cold dressed chicken and tongue, or cold roast veal and ham. 
Mince the meat finely, and season well with salt, cayenne, and powdered sweet herbs. The later may be omitted, if liked. 
Press the mince together, and enclose it in a puff paste, or good pastry that is large enough to contain it. Bake in a 
well-heated oven. These rolls are especially adapted for pic-nic parties. Time to bake, half an hour for fresh meat, 
fifteen minutes for cooked meat." <br>

1/2 lb. Sausages. 1 Egg. 1/2 lb. Puff Paste.<br> 
Utensils--Two basins, pastry board, rolling pin, pastry brush, saucepan, wooden spoon, egg-beater, baking sheet. Enough 
for 3 or 4 persons. 
Boil the sausages for 5 minutes, then skin them, and when cold, cut them in half, lengthways. Prepare half a pound of puff
 paste, and roll it out to about an eighth of an inch thickness...Cut it into squares, about four inches and a half 
across. Brush along the two side edges of these with cold water. Lay a piece of sausage on the side nearest you, seeing
 that the paste reaches half an inch beyond each end of the sausage. Now roll it over, until the far edge of the paste is
 reached, and brush this edge over with cold water, to make it stick. Press the ends of the paste gently together, and 
brush the tops of the rolls over with whole beaten-up egg. Lay the rolls on a wet baking sheet, and bake in a moderately
 quick oven for 20 to 30 minutes. Stand them on a fold of paper to drain when taken from the oven. Arrange them on a fancy
 dish-paper, garnish with fresh parsley, and serve, either hot or cold. It is best to boil the sausages before making them
 into rolls, in order to extract some of the fat. If this is not done the puff paste is apt to be sodden. <br>

<b>SAMOSAS/SANBUSAQ</b> <p>
"Samosa...are small, crisp, flaky pastries made in India, usually fried by sometimes baked. They are stuffed with a variety of 
fillings such as cheese, cheese and egg, minced meat with herbs and spices, vegetables such as potatoes, etc. Sweet fillings 
are also popular. Samosas are usually eaten as a snack, often as a street food. The Indian version is merely the best known of an 
entire family of stuffed pastries or dumplings popular from Egypt and Zanzibar to C. Asia and W. China. Arab cookery books of the 
10th and 13th centuries refer to these pastries as sanbusak (the pronunciation still current in Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon), 
sanbusaq, or sanbusaj, all reflecting the early medieval form of this Persian word: sanbosag. Claudia Roden...quotes a poem by Ishiq 
ibn Ibrahim al-Mausili (9th century) praising sanbusaj...In the Middle East the traditional shape of sanbusak is a half-moon, usually 
with edges crimped or marked with the fingernails; but triangular shapes are also used. In India triangular and cone-shaped 
samosas are popular. In Afghanistan, where the name is sambosa, and in the Turkish-speaking nations, where is its called 
samsa...it is made both in half-moon shapes and triangles. Sedentary Turkish people such as the Uzbeks and the people of Turkey 
itself usually bake their samsas, but nomads such as the Kazakhs fry them...These pastries were still made in Iran as late as 
the 16th century, but they have disappeared from most of the country today..." <br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2nd edition, 2007(p. 690) 
<p>
"Sanbusak...There is reason to believe that this preparation is the progenitor of the empanada and calzone. Sanbusak,an Arabic word that comes from the Persian sanbusa, means anything triangular, was first described as a stuffed pastry 
in the early ninth century by Isaq ibn Ibrahim (d. 851), a well-known author from Iraq. In al-Masudi's (died c. 956) Meadows 
of Gold, there are foods described that sound like early sanbusak. The twelfth-century dietetic manual, the Liber 
de ferculis et condimentis, which was translated from the Arabic...In the thirteenth century Arabic cookery book of al-Baghdadai, 
sanbusaj is described as a stuffed triangular pastry fried in sesame oil. Another early written recipe for sanbusaq appears in the 
thirteenth-century cookbook attributed to Ibn al-Adim (d. 1262, the Kitab al-wusla ila l-habib fir wasfi al-tayyibat wat-tib, where it is 
described as a small half-moon of puff pastry stuffed with cheese, chopped meat, or qaymaq...By the Thirteenth century, 
Sanbusak appears in Spain, almost as the same recipe, a triangular fried pastry. Sanbusak are possible, although 
not as likely, the origin of the Turkish borek and therefore the origin, too, of the savory pastries, the Tunisian brik, 
Algerian burak, Moroccan briwat, and the Armenian beoreg, as well as Spanish, Greek, Italian, and Sicilian versions." <br>

"Samosa. A deep-fried snack, consisting of a crisp, triangular and layery wheat casing filled with spiced meat or vegetables. In about AD 1300 Amir Khusrau describes,
among the foods of the Muslim aristocracy in Delhi, the 'samosa, preapred from meat, ghee, onion, etc.'. About fifty yearsl later Ibn Battuta calls it a samusak, describing
it a s 'minced meat cooked with almonds, walnuts, pistachios, onions and spices placed inside a thin envelope of wheat and deep fried in ghee'. The <i>Ain-i-Akbari</i>
lists, among dishes of meat cooked with wheat, the qutab, 'which the people of Hind call the sanbusa'. All these descriptions suggest that the amosa was not an 
item brought by these courts from their parent lands, but was an existing indigenous product, perhaps enriched in its stuffing to cater to royal courts."<br>

Choux a la creme, <a href="foodpies.html#profiterole">profiteroles</a> and cream puffs are said to have originated in Renaissance
France and Italy. Choux paste is different from other types of pastry because when cooked, it rises
and the finished product has a hollow center. As was the custom of the day, these holes were
variously filled with sweet or savory fillings. Cream puffs, as we know them today, are usually
filled with <a href="foodpuddings.html#custard">custard</a> or <a href="foodpuddings.html#creme">French

<a name="choux">
<b>Here is the legend:</b><br>
"Choux pastry is said to have been invented in 1540 by Popelini, Catherine de' Medici's chef, but
the pastrycook's art only truly began to develop in the 17th century and greatest innovator at the
beginning of the 19th century was indubitably [Antonin] Careme..."<br>
---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, Jenifer Harvey Lang, editor [Crown:New York] 1988 (p.
777-8)
<P>
<b>These are the facts:</b><br>
"The real creation of choux paste is complex and cannot be established with any certainty, not least because its manufacture
is a relatively simple process and it is possible that it was independently created in many places and at various times. In principle,
choux paste requires only four ingredients: water, fat, flour and egg. The incorporation of an egg into what is effectively hot-water
paste--and a fairly obvious innovation for an inquisitive cook--would produce a kind of choux paste. Tracing early cookery receipts is
beset with difficulties, not least because authors heedlessly repeat foundation-myth andedotes. Elizabeth David, writing about the 
Florentine cooks that Catherine Medici was said to have brought with her to France in 1533, states, "Those cooks...are part of a myth originating
in mid-nineteenth-century France, perhaps in the imagination of of of the popular hsitorical novelists who flourished at that
period, and certainly without existence in historical fact...Researchers are also faced with establishing the meaning of archaic
terms and technical expressions. The nomenclature of of cookery is complicated not only by difficulties in establish early
usage, but also by the lack of conformity of usage, not helped by the idiosyncrasies of early-modern spelling. A single cookery
method or culinary product may be concealed under a whole variety of labels or (conversely and just a confusing) a single term may apply
to one or more different methods or receipts. Such etymological considerations--a focal point for most investigations by
cookery historians--bear upon choux...pastry...Historically, we find at least two pastries referred to as 'choux'. It seems likely
that the earliest use of the term in England was by was of imported translations of French seventeenth-century cookery books. 
In La Varenne's <i>The French Pastry Cook</i> of 1656, the reader is told of 'The manner how to make a little Puff-paste Bunns, called in 
French Choux.' But this paste is neither the puff-paste so beloved by French and English cooks from the sixteenth century or earlier--and 
known in France as pate feuilletee and in England as butter pasted and puff or puft paste--nor is it what today we would recognize
as choux paste. The ingredients for La Varenne's reciept includes a fist-size of fresh cheese...bruised with a little flour, two
eggs, a further handful of flour or salt. When mixed, this is spread 'as thick as a finger', baked in two pieces and, once cooked,
spread with butter, sugar and rosewater. The two pieces are sandwiched together and warmed in the oven, then decorated with sugar
and preserved lemon. La Varenne also writes about this type of paste made into morsels the size of small eggs. So here the term 
'choux' seems to apply to both paste and to the small buns made from this paste. With a little imagination, a round cooked choux
bun, or fritter, resembles the shape of a small cabbage. With this bun shape--choux being French for cabbage--we can see (literally)
the reason for the name of the paste. These cheese-based pastes can be traced back to at least the thirteenth century where similar
receipts for fritters appear in anonymous Andalusian cookbooks...Massailot's ingredients for 'Benioles', or Petit Choux, are simliar
to La Varenne's...In England one of the several meanings of the words 'chou' and 'puffs' is amost identical to that of La
Varenne's and Massailot's 'choux' paste. Cotgrave, as early as 1611, describes 'petit chou' as 'puffe-cake, or loafe, made of 
butter, cheese, fine meal, and yolks of egges.' He tells us that there are two kinds, 'one round, and plumpe like an apple; the other
also round, but much flatter'...in 1706 'petits choux' crops up in Edward Phillips' dictionary,
<i>New World of English Words</i>, 'a sort of Paste for garninshing made of fat Cheese, Flower, Eggs, Salt, etc. bake'd in a 
Pye-pan, and Ic'd over with fine Sugar'...there are several receipts found in early European cookbooks and manuscripts that broadly
refer to what today's cooks call 'choux paste,' or what we have referred to as 'twice-cooked' pastry. The original French name was
pate a chaud...Importantly, the second cooking of these pastries results in the formation of a pouch or pocket--ideal for filling with
savoury of sweet mixture. In sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England there were other words that sometimes (but by no
means always) denoted a choux paste product, including 'benets'...'puffs' and certain types of 'fritters'...Certainly the idea of
cooking a paste of flour, butter and liquid and then adding eggs to produce a small puffed pastry cake was known to some French 
cooks at the start of the seventeenth century...But choux paste, though by other names, can be found in even earlier books and 
manuscripts. Perhaps the earliest extant English receipt if found in <i>A Book of Cookrye</i> (1591) first published in 
1584. The ingredients for 'Benets' or "Bennets'( a kind of fritter) are practially identical to those fo John Eveyln's
'French Fritters.'...The refined French name for these French Friters is 'Beignets Souffles'...Eveyln tellus us that these
fritters are of French origin, and this may well be so. However, we can find several receipts recognizable as choux paste in the 
German cook Sabina Welserin's manuscript of 1553. They are more explicit than any contemporary French manuscripts and indicate
long-standing familiarity with the technique. One hazards a guess that it originated independently of Queen Catherine's Popelin, 
or that it derived from an earlier common source...Most of the earliest receipts for choux paste are for fritters...The term 'choux'
had not settled down [in the 18th century] to today's meaning...Today, the terms 'Cream Bun or Puff', 'profiterole' and
'choux' seems to have settled down; the ambiguity no longer an issue."<br>

"Choux pastry is a thick batter made from flour, milk, butter, and eggs. Its most typical
application is in the making of small round buns (as used for profiteroles) known in French as
choux, literally  cabbages, from their shape--hence pate a choux, the pastry used for making
them. The first reference to the term in English comes in the 1706 edition of Edward Phillips's
<i>New World of English Words</i>: Petits Choux, a sort of paste for garnishing, made of fat
Cheese, Flour, Eggs, Salt, etc., bak'd in a Pye-pan, and Ic'd over with fine Sugar.' But it was not

convents. The puff pastries called  feuillantines were first made in the seventeenth century in a
convent of that name...Sugar and chocolate had now arrived on the scene; from the time of Louis
XIV onwards those delicacies became extremely popular...Gastronomy flourished in the
nineteenth century...Fauvel, a chef working for the famous pastry cook Chiboust, invented the
Genoese sponge and also had a hand in the creation of the gateau Saint-Honore, so called in
honour

<b>What are Profieroles?</b><br>
"Profiteroles are small round choux-pastry buns with a filling. This can be either savoury or sweet, but by far the commonest
manifestation of the profiterole is with a cream filling and a covering of chocolate sauce, and piled in large quanitities, 
in the more ambitious type of restaurant, into a sort of pyramid. The word originated in French as a diminutive form of
profit, and so etymologically means 'small gains'--and indeed it may to begin with have denoted a 'little something extra'

<b>Croquembouche</b><br>
Artistic confectionery presentations are known in many cultures and cuisines. Food historians tell us 19th century 
French croquembouche likely evolved from Medieval subtleties. <a href="foodpies.html#strufoli">Italian strufoli and Greek loukoumades</a>, similar 
in concept and presentation, are credited to Medieval Arabic cuisine. See notes at the end of this message for 
details.  Careme is generally credited for sparking modern French cuisine's interest in fanciful presentations. Choux, the

<b>What is Croquembouche?</b><br>
"Croquembouche. A decorative cone-shaped preparation built up of small items of patisserie or confectionery 
and glazed with a caramel syrup to make it crisp. The croquembouche is usually placed on a base of nougat. It is 
built around a conical mould, also called a croquembouche, which is removed through the base when the small 
pieces are securely fixed to each other by the solidified caramel. It is traditionally served in France at buffets, 
weddings and first-communion meals. The traditional croquembouche is made of a little chou buns, sometimes 
filled with some kind of cream and dipped in sugar cooked to the crack stage. Croquembouches are also made 
with crystallized (candied) or sugar-coated fruits, brandy snaps, or nougat. They can be decorated with sugar-coated 
almonds, sugar flowers or spun caramel." <br>
---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, completely revised and updated [Clarkson Potter:New York] 2001 (p. 374) 
<p>
"A croquembouche is a spectacular cone-shaped confection constructed of scored of small choux-pastry buns. In 
France it traditionally forms a centrepiece at celebrations such as weddings and first communions. The whole 
edifice is usually glazed with caramelized sugar--hence the name, literally crunch in the mouth'." <br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 98) 
<p>
"The typical shape of modern croequembouche is an inverted cone...However, when Alice Wooledge-Salmon 
investigated the history of these confections she found herself in a whole new world of architectural structures 
which had their origin in the subtleties displayed in medieval tables and evolved, under the influence of Careme 
in particular, into the category for grosses pieces de fonds, where they kept company with Turkish mosques, 
Persian pavilions, Gothic towers, and other pieces montees. The shape in those days was that of a Turkish fez, 
something like that of the confections later known as sultanes. The same author goes on to explain, vividly and in 
detail, how the whole genre spiralled upwards out of control towards the end of the 19th century, but then 
subsided to manageable dimensions--permitting the survival of a relatively plain range of croquembouches 
through the 20th century, the basic form being simply a conical pile of choux balls on a nougat base with spun 
sugar aigrette (plume) or other decoration at the top." <br>

"In France and Belgium there were two main styles [of wedding cakes]. Regarded as the more traditional was a 
giant croquembouche. This is a cone, wide at the base, built up of small round choux pastries, which are filled 
with confectioner's cream and dipped in hot toffee. As the toffee cools it solidifies, making a light brown glossy 
construction. This can then be decorated with ribbons and sugared almonds, birds and flowers, and often, for 
wedding, as small bride-and-groom model on the top. For baptisms, first communions and other events, a similar 
though probably smaller cake may also be prepared with slightly different decorative motifs. Each guest will be 
served a number of choux broken out from the whole as a sweet course in the wedding meal. Since the toffee 
which maintains the structure will soon soften and the whole is liable therefore to sag or even collapse, it is a 
confection that must be prepared and eaten with as little delay as possible. There will normally be one such cake, 
its size determined by the number of guests. One Breton patisserie reported in 1990 that 60 per cent of the cakes 
he supplied for wedding were croquembouches; ten years earlier it had been 90 per cent. It is possible to use the 
same construction technique to produce a variety of objects...The same patissier reported that 65 per cent of his 
croquembouche orders were for the basic type since others were 15 per cent more costly." <br>

<b>About eclairs</b><br>
The food history encyclopedias (including the <i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>) and reference
books all
describe eclairs but provide little if any details regarding their origin. This probably means the
eclair is a product of food evolution. There is some conjecture that perhaps Antonin Careme
(1784-1833), a famous pastry chef for French royalty might have created something akin to
eclairs. The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> traces the term "eclair" in the English language to
1861 "Vanity Fair
[magazine]2 Feb 50/1  A Waiter, whereon, stood..a plate of macaroons, eclairs and sponge cake."
In French, the word eclair means a flash of lightning. 
<p>
"Eclair. The primary meaning of eclair in French is  lightning', and one (not very convincing)
explanation advanced for its application to these cream-filled choux-pastry temptations is that it
was suggested by the light gleaming from their coating of fondant icing."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2003  (p. 117)
<p>
The oldest recipe we have for eclairs in an American cookbook was published in 1884: 
<blockquote>
"Cream cakes<br>
1 cup hot water<br>
1/2 teaspoonful salt<br>
1/2 cup butter<br>
1 1/2 cup pastry flour<br>
5 eggs, yolks and whites beaten separately
<p>
Boil the water, salt, and butter. When boiling, add the dry flour, stir well for five minutes, and
when cool add the eggs. This is such a stiff mixture, many find it easier to mix with the hand, and
some prefer to add the eggs whole, one at a time. When well mixed, drip, in tablespoonfuls, on a
buttered baking-pan, some distance apart. Bake twenty to thirty minutes, or till brown and well
pugged. Split when cool, and fill with cream.<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Pot pie</b></font><br>
Meat pies descend from Medieval culinary traditions. The standard pie is oven-baked in a special container (metal, earthenware)
created for the purpose. 
"Pot pies," first surfacing in the late 18th century, are composed with similar ingredients. The difference? They are 
cooked on open hearths in pots, kettles, or <a href="foodmeats.html#dutchoven">dutch ovens</a>. Since many
early cookbooks omit actual baking instructions, it is possible some of the meat pies could have been baked in 
either oven or pot. Pennsylvania Dutch <a href="foodpies.html#slipperypotpie">Slippery Pot Pie</a> (Hinkelboi)offers yet another delicious variation.
Ironically? Today's "pot pies" are baked in the oven or heated in the microwave. 
<p>
<b>One crust or two?</b><br>
Our survey of historic American cookbooks confirms "pot pie" always has a top crust. 
It may, or may not, have a bottom crust. In some cases, the bottom crust is a layer of forcemeat(stuffing) and the top 
layer is pastry.

and harvest days, was a large pot-pie." (p. 1294). The 1805 edition of Hannah Glasse's <i>Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy</i> classified "Pot Pie"  in a special section titled 
"Several New

<b>Slippery Pot Pie</b> (Pennsylvania Dutch/Maryland)<br>
"The Pennsylvania Dutch know this more commonly as Hinkelboi, not 'chicken in a blanket,' the literal sense of the original German. Although Hinkelboi is technically similar to a 
Pennsylvania Dutch chicken Botboi (pot pie) and may even tasted like one, it must not be confused with the true Botboi, a baked stew thickened with large, flat noodles. Here, the 
chickens are simply encased in a crust. Many Pennsylvania Dutch also call the pot pie noodles Botboi, which adds a layer of confusion to the evolution of this dish. Nevertheless, both 
Hineklboi baked in a pot and chicken Botboi have a common ancestor. The meat pie, after all, is nothing more than a stew or casserole in a crust, hence the infinite variations. We tend to 
associate meat pies with English cookery, but they were also known in medieval Germany. Originally, German meat pies were commonly made of fish for consumption during times of 
religious fasting, but gradually, beef and pork pies gained in popularity. However, not having their own term for meat pies, the Germans borrowed pastete from the French as early as the 
fourteenth century. Thus, chicken pie became Huhner-Pastete. Technically, a proper German Pastete must have an upper crust; otherwise, to the Pennsylvania Dutch, it would fall into 
the category of a tart of Kuche, like pumpkin pie. To safeguard the distinction, many Pennsylvania Dutch use the term Boi, from English pie; for any sort of meat pie, hence Hinkelboi...
As daily fare, meat pies were enormously popular with the Pennsylvania Dutch because they made use of leftovers or poorer grades for meat. They could be baked head and reheated or
 warmed over the next day. They were an ideal meal for travelers and were often served to field hands during their breaks."

<b>"Chicken Pie in a Pot. Huhner mit einer Decke, Hinkelboi </b><br>
Cut up 2 young hens, place them in a deep pot lined with pastry dough and thin slices of salt pork or ham. Pour cold water or a cold, weak meat stock over the chicken. For a small 
chicken pie, use 2 ounces of butter, a little flour, cover with a light pastry dough, and let it bake 1 hour in the oven."<br>

<b>What made it "slippery?"</b><br>
Slip engraving was a traditional decorative technique used on earthenware pottery. Pie plates were the most popular. Presumably there is a connection. <br>
"Artistically considered, the ornamental earthenware of the Dutch potteries follows the lines of earliest known European potteries, and its 'slip-decoration' or 'sgraffito' which
was developed in Southern Europe, particularly in Engalnd and in Italy. As the Romans inaugurated slip decoration during the time that there was a larte Roman colony in the 
Palatinate on the Rhine wehre the Dutch came from, it is faily clear that the Dutch sgraffito ware derives from the early Roman days. France copied the art from the Germans,
and so did England...Slip-engraving is...a treatment consisting of entirely covering the outer surface of the utensil with the slip of clay, and then etching on it the 
design. The Dutch in America added new values to the art, including the use of a vivid green by means of copper or verdigris...The pie plate, or poi schuessel was the most general
 article of sgraffito work, 
and the most widely distributed. The pie has always been a great favorite of the Dutch, sharing this preference with New England...The Dutch...made a wider variety of pies than any other
group in America...The reason why the sgraffito poi scheussel or pie plate of earthenware was so much used was because of the Dutch ovens so generally in use. 
When the Pennsylvania Dutch hausfrau baked her bread on the Dutch oven hearth, she was able, without any additional fuel cost, to bake pies also in the same oven at the

Recipes for stewed pumpkins tempered with sugar, spices and cream wrapped in pastry  trace
their roots to Medieval cuisine. We find several period European/Middle Eastern recipes
combining fruit, meat and cheese similarly spiced and presented. The Columbian Exchange [16th
century] flooded the "old world" with "new world" foods. These new foods (pumpkins, potatoes,
tomatoes, peanuts, corn etc.) were incorporated/assimilated/adapted into traditional European
cuisines, each in their own way and time. Culinary evidence confirms it took several generations before
many "new world" foods were accepted by the general public. Pumpkins seem to have skipped
this honeymoon period. They were similar to "old world" gourds and squash, and superior in
flavor. They were also just as easy to cultivate. As such, pumpkins (aka pompions) were
embraced almost immediately.
<p>
If pumpkins are a "New World" food, why are they sometimes listed as ingredients in Medieval
European recipes? If you notice, these references are usually found  in Medieval cooking books
with modernized recipes. The original recipes simply call for squash or gourds. Why substitute
pumpkin? Some Medieval recipes for members of the curcurbit family (gourds, calabash,
cucumbers, melons) are more palatable to contemporary tastes if you make them with pumpkin.
It's also readily available.

"3. Winter Squash or Pumpkin Soup...The curcurbits are a large, rich family including cucumbers,
melons, and squashes. But the Old World knew neither the winter squash (Curcurbita pepo) nor
the pumpkin (Curcurbita maxima), both of which were brought from the Americas. If we can trust
the title of the recipe, Congordes, and if we think of the depictions of squash (zucche) harvests in
the many manuscripts comprising the Tacuinum sanitatis--a medical treatise of Arab origin that
lists the medicinal properties of various foods--the cook is probably dealing here with gourds
(Lagenaria vulgaris). These came originally from southern Asia, and were well known in Western
Europe in the Middle Ages. But without fresh gourds to hand, you can prepare this soup with
winter squash or pumpkin."<br>

"As for pumpkin pie, in particular, in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England "people of
substance" were familiar with a form of pumpkin pie that both followed the medieval tradition of
"rich pies of mixed ingredients" and also bore resemblance to the consumption of apple-stuffed
pumpkins typically engaged in by people of lesser substance...Pumpkin pie went out of fashion in
Britain during the eighteenth century. Perhaps Edward Johnson reflected this emerging attitude in
the 1650s when he offered as a sign of New England's progress toward prosperity the fact that in
most households people were eating "apples, pears, and quince tarts instead of their former
Pumpkin Pies." Pumpkin had been superceded by the more civilized fruits (free of association
with the natives), of which the settlers had first been deprived. Such an anticipation that pumpkin
pie was on the way out was premature, as far as the developments on this side of the Atlantic
were concerned."<br>

"Among vegetables, the Northeastern Indians made particularly lavish use of squash, even more
than other American Indians, and especially of pumpkin. Both squash and pumpkin were
baked, usually by being placed whole in the ashes or embers of a dying fire (in the case of squash,
the acorn and butternut varieties were preferred) and they were moistened afterwards wtih some
form of animal fat, or maple syrup, or honey; and both were also made into soup. When pumpkin
was made into a soup, it often underwent some enriching which converted it into something more
like a stew. A seventeenth century Oneida recipe specified that pumpkin should be "boiled with
meat to the consistency of potato soup."<br>

these recipes originated in France.

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Quiche</b></font><br>
The practice of baking sweet and savory dishes composed of eggs, cream, and spices in pastry
shells is ancient. Quiche, as we know to today, evolved from Ancient Roman patinea (<a
href="foodcakes.html#cheesecake">cheesecake</a>) and
Medieval European <a href="foodpies.html#tarts">tarts</a>. 
Medieval recipes for a <a href="http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/cariadoc/tarts.html#10"> Tart in
Ember Day</a> (Ember day was a Christian meatless day) and  <a
href="http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/cariadoc/desserts.html#21"> Tart de Bry </a> 
resemble modern quiche.
 Food historians place the modern recipe for quiche in (what is currently) the Lorraine region of
France. In medieval times, this area was known as Lothringen, a Germanic kingdom.
<p>
"Quiche. --The quiche or kiche (sometimes the word is spelt in this way) originates on Lorriane, although 
some writers claim that this kind of savory custard tart belongs to German cookery, since in German cookery, the quiche is known under the name
kuchen, from which the word kiche could have come. There are several kinds of quiche. Each region of Lorraine of Alsace has its own, and each claims
that this alone is the real story. The name quiche is also used for some sweet custard tarts served as a sweet. That these should be so called is wrong,
because the real quiche, that of Lorraine, is always served as hors- d'euvre and never for the sweet course."<br>

"A quiche is a pastry cooked a cooked savoury custard containing items such as vegetables, bacon,
or cheese. It is a specialty of the Alsace-Lorraine region, which has been bandied between France
and Germany over the centuries, and the term quiche itself is a French version of kuche, a word
from the German dialect of Lorraine...The authentic quiche Lorraine contains only smoked bacon
in adition ot the cream-and-egg custard, but many alternative versions have grown up that include
cheese and onion."<br>

<p>
"Quiche. A French [dish]...most prominent in Lorraine...It was only at the beginning of the 19th
century that the term became current, and it then meant a tart with a filling of egg and cream...The
version now well known, which includes bacon (and sometimes cheese) in the filling, was
originally a variant known as quich au lard. Whereas the original could be eaten on meatless
days, this variant--now known around the world as quiche Lorraine--could not. Nonetheless, a
quiche Lorraine is perceived as something with only a slight meat content. This may account for
the reputation it acquired in some English-speaking countries, where it only became familiar in the
latter part of the 20th century, as a dish not suitable for "he-men" or " real men." At the end of
the
20th century the quiche has become the subject of innuerable variations..."<br>

"In a review of New York's Leopard restaurant in the February 1970 issue of <i>Gourmet</i>,
Donald Aspinwall Allan praised the appetizers because "there is always a good quiche," including
onion, ham, leek, or anchovy and olive. Restaurants and caterers soon learned that while quiche
was both a popular and hearty appetizer, it was also sturdy, and could be held for
hours...Quiche's enduring popularity into the Seventies had a great deal to do with the scope it
allowed creative cooks. As one <i>Bon Appetit</i> reader commented, while inquiring after the
recipe for the moussaka quiche...served at The Cottage Crest in Massachusetts, "There seems to
be no end to culinary imagination when it comes to making quiches."...<i>Gourmet</i> (October
1971) even published a recipe for cranberry-carrot dessert quiche to be served with whipped
cream. Plain old quiche Lorraine--with cheese, of course--was still around, but it was generally
considered much too boring...By the early Eighties Americans had been served too many

"Quiche Lorraine</b><br>
This is a milk flan in which fresh cream replaces the milk: the use of fresh cream is characteristic
of quiche. The recipes vary a little bit: the oldest use some bread dough, and the bacon used here
was often not included.The quiche is molded in a tart pan made of thick steel with a fluted edge
and is served in the cooking utensil itself. This is due to the difficulty of unmoulding the quiche
without breaking the crust unless you have a large spatula with a shortened handle, which is used
in some regions in the east, that you slide under the tarts to take them out of the mold. Even so,
as far as a quiche is concerned, this is often useless, because the custard spills out a little and
makes the crust stick to the serrated borders of the tart pan. When you do not have a serrated tart
pan, you can make the quiche in a flan circle...As for all preparations of this type, a quiche is
served quite hot. Time: 1 hour, 45 minutes (including time for resting the dough). Serves 8.
<br>
<b>For the dough:</b> 200 grams (7 ounces) of flour; 100 grams (3 1/2 ounces, 7 tablespoons) of butter;
3/4 deciliter ( 2 2/1 fluid ounces, scant 1/3 cup) of water; a pinch of salt.
<br>
<b>For the filling:</b> about 200 grams (7 ounces) of lean bacon; 50 grams (1 3/4 ouces, 3 «
tablespoons) of butter; a good 1/2 liter (generous 2 cups) or ordinary cream, completely fresh; 5
medium eggs; 2 nice pinches of salt.
A tart pan with fluted sides about 25 centimeters (10 inches) in diameter
<br>
<b>Procedure.</b> Prepare the dough as directed...kneading it twice. Let it rest for 1 hour. Meanwhile,
trim the bacon of its rind, then cut into it small slices 1/2 centimeter (3/16 inch) thick. Blanche
them...and drain them. With the rolling pin, roll out the dough as for a tart into a nice round
pancake that has an even thickness of at least 12 centimeter (3/16 inch) and a diameter of 25-26
centimeters (10-10 1/2 inches). Slide your two hands under the dough to transfer it to a tart pan
that has been generously buttered; with the ends of your fingers, press the dough into the bottom
and particularly onto the fluted sides The fold the dough over the sides and pass the rolling pin
over it to cut off the excess. Beat the eggs as for an omelet and salt them, then gradually mix the
cream into them. Divide the butter into thin slices and spread them out over the bottom of the
quiche. Place the bacon on top, pressing lightly on it so that the pieces stick to the bottom and
will not float to the surface when the custard is poured into it. The cover everything with the
custard, without allowing any to spill onto the sides of the dough. Carefully slide the tart pan into
the oven a good medium heat coming mostly from the bottom. Allow 30-35 minutes for
cooking."<br>

In Switzerland we had a vile tempered cook named Marguerite. Her one idea, after being generally

mountain climbers. While she was certainly not born with a silver spoon in her mouth--although it was large
enough to hold several--I am convinced she arrived with a cooking apron in her hand. If she has attained
her ideal, many a climber will feel worth while to scale a perilous peak to reach her kitchen. The following Cheese
Custard Pie was always served in solitary state. Its flavor varied with Marguerite's moods and her supply
of cheese. It was never twice the same, as she had no written rule, but I have endeavored to make one

Belgium, Lorraine, etc. A custard is called for, usually made with:<br>
2 cups scalded cream<br>
4 eggs<br>
1 cup grated Italian or Swiss cheese<br>
1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
Freshly ground black pepper<br>
A few grains of cayenne<br>
Beat with a fork until blended. There are numerous variations of the above A pie shell of rich pastry is buttered lightly. Partially cooked bacon is broken or 
cut up and sprinkled over the bottom. Sometimes the cheese is not added to the custard but sprinkled over the bacon and then covered with the custard. The pie
is baked in a hot oven 450 degrees for 12 minutes. The heat is reduced to a slow oven 300 degrees and the pie is baked until the custard is set, about 35
minutes longer. To test use the method is given under Cup Custard, page 710. Serve it hot or cold."<br>

Method. In the past the quiche was made with a bread paste. Modern practice has substituted short crust or sometimes even puff pastry. Line the
pan with ordinary short crust (see DOUGH, lining paste) a pie dish or plate with fluted edges, 8 inches in diameter and well buttered. See that the
pastry extends a little beyond the edges. Put in the bottom of this flan case thin slices of streaky bacon, blanched and lightly fried in butter. Fill the
crust with a mixture composed of 4 eggs and 2 cups (4 decilitres) of thick fresh cream, seasoned with salt and well beaten. Put on top, when the flan is
filled, 2 teaspoons of butter divided up into tiny pieces. Cook in the oven at moderate heat (375 degrees F.) for 30 to 35 minutes. Serve very jot. NOTE: Sometimes
the flan pastry is enriched with thin slices of Gruyere cheese, which are set alternately with the bacon."<br>

It seems odd that this very special pie, traditional in France, was so long in gaining popularity in America. A rich custard with cheese and bacon, it may be
served either as an appetizer or as a main luncheon dish. Swiss cheese, which the Swiss know as Ementhaler, may be used in making this dish, but Gruyere has more

"Quiche Lorraine</b>, although it seems to be the most well known, is only one of a series of generally simple-to-make and appetizing

or anything else which is combined with eggs, poured into a pastry shell, and baked in the oven until it puffs and browns. It is 
practically foolproof, and you can invent your own combinations. Serve it with a salad, hot French bread, and a cold white wine;

Refrigerator pies (aka ice box pies) descend from <a href="foodcakes.html#icebox">Refrigerator Cake</a> and other no-bake recipes made popular during the Great Depression. There are dozens
 of recipe variations. Pineapple is one of the perennial favorites. Crusts range from standard pastry shell to crushed cracker (graham) and cookie (gingernaps, vanilla 
wafers, chocolate wafers) crumbs. The recipe ingredients some folks list are comglomerations of various brand products made by competing companies (Jell-O is Kraft; Hydrox is Sunshine) so it is
 unlikely the recipe was printed on the back of a box.  Similar recipes, however, using Oreos or Famous Chocolate Wafers, might have been on a box. 
This explains why some folks call this recipe Jell-O Pie. Recipes like Refrigerator Pie easily adapt to whatever the cook has on hand.

<blockquote>
<b>[1931]</b><br>
"An innovation in cookery, which offsets every possibility of failure and offers a light, dainty, fluffy dessert, fit to be set
before the most fastidious taste, is the sunshine ice box pie. Begin by making the family's favorite pie crust or the regulation
of one of 1 cupful of flour, 3 tablespoonfuls of shortening, 1/2 teaspoonful of salt and enough ice water to mix. Line a deep pie pan
and bake in a slow oven so as to dry out the pastry. When it is light brown remove it from the stove to cool. To make the filling,
separate the yolks and whites of 4 eggs. Beat yolks and whites separately. To the whites add 1/2 cupful of sugar and beat until 
very stiff. To the yolks and 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon juice and a grated rind of 2 lemons, a pinch of salt and 1/2 cupful of 
sugar. Dissolve for 5 minutes 1/2 tablespoonful of gelatine in 1-3 cupful of cold water. Place the yolk mixture in a double boiler, 
stirring constantly until the liquid is thickened and creamy. Remove it from the fire and add the gelatin. Fold the pie crust and set it in the ice
box until time to serve. Just before serving spread the top of the pie with a thin layer of whipped cream. This pie keeps for days."<br>

"Pie is always acceptable as a dessert no matter what
the season. We are sometimes reluctant about serving it in warm weather bcause we dislike to heat the oven. This is no 
longer an excuse for not having it because there are the uncooked varieties, the ones which require no heat. They are sometimes called
refrigerator pies. Refrigerator pies usually have crumb crusts. Corn flake crumbs are excellent for this purpose. They have a 
good color and add a distinctive flavor. The crust may be made in two different ways."<br>

"Those gorgeous creations of lady fingers and whipped cream and nuts and macaroons known as refrigerator cakes have long been great favorites...But for the times when 
a less rich and elaborate creation is in order, good cooks of 1933 have opened up a whole new bag of tricks. In place of so much cream, for instance, they are using 
mixtures that depend more on eggs and cornstarch and gelatin and marshmallows for the thickening ingredient. Instead of making these desserts always in the form of the
 deep loaf cake, they are making them in pie plates to be cut exactly like pies. And in place of lady fingers or sliced sponge cake or angel food, they are using all sorts of 
sweetened wafers such as graham crackers, chocolate or vanilla wafers, gingersnaps. To show you what I mean here is a recipe for orange pie...
<p>
<b>Orange Refrigerator Pie</b><br>
First soak 1 1/2 tablespoons gelatin in 3 tablespoons cold water. Then turn this into 1/2 cup boiling water in the top of double boiler, and stir till dissolved. Next stir in 4 
tablespoons sugar. Let mixture cool. Then add 1 cup strained orange juice and 1 tablespoon strained lemon juice. Put some ice water in bottom of double boiler and set
 the top part into it. Let stand till mixture starts to set. Then beat with rotary beater with rotary beater. Next fold into the mixture 1/2 cup of diced orange and 2 egg white 
beaten stiff. For the crust to this pie, use either vanilla wafers or gingersnaps. Crush or grind enough of them to make a thick layer of crumbs in the bottom of the pie plate.
 Line the sides of the plate with wafers broken into halves (round side out) with more crumbs between the wafers. Then turn in the fruit mixture. and place in the refrigerator
 to set. This will take about 4 hours. But there'll be no harm done if you want to make this pie the night before. And in case you'd like to use berries in place off oranges 
that'll be good, too. Just substitute the same amount of berries and juice."<br>

"Cheers! Also a couple of tigers! For we just peered into the refrigerator and mother is baking a pie! No fooling. It's a real 
refrigerator. Also, it's a real pie. it went in soft and soupy. it's coming out tremblingly firm, enticingly fluffy--the most palate
teasing morsel yet to call itself pie. And the answer--the newly arrived family of refrigerator pastries that is setting the town
buzzing and taking the floor even from the absorbing matter of jigsaws. The delicate backbone--if one day apply such a sturdy name
to such a quivering creating--is gelatin. But the result is like no gelatin dessert yet on the books...Chiffons and cream
pies start out the list, but lemon chiffon has now taken to itself relatives.  Coffee chiffon, and chiffons glorified with crushed
pineapple or fresh spring strawberries shiver with glee as they are turned into crisp, baked shells and slid into the refrigerator  
to be "cold-baked" to a cut-able firmness. For refrigerator pies (except for the pre-baked crust) never see the oven. Some of the 
ingredients do, however, get acquainted with the top of the stove. And of the coffee chiffon, served up with hot chocolate, demi-tasse, or even a
cup of tea, as a light, relieving touch after a robust meal, is, to me, the perfect selection...gelatin isn't the only way we have
of putting standupableness into the new era of refrigerator pastries. Another pie--or it may be turned into a whole family of
tarts--stands up because someone discovered that lemon juice thickens condensed milk..."<br>

""Give us more refrigerator cakes and pies" some of my readers have begged. So today I am presenting one of those fluffy-as-a-cloud chiffon pies which looks ok, 
so hard to make, but actually requires no cooking at all! You will win instant fame as a cook when you sevre this one, and you can take the bows with a chuckle up your
 sleeve knowing it is easier that "pie." Refrigerator pies can be made in a pastry shell, which, of course, is baked before the filling it put in. This pie today, is made in a
 crumb shell, which is much easier. Crumb shells can be made of dry, crisp cereals, vanilla wafers, graham crackers or dry cake crumbs. Simply roll the cereal, crackers 
or crumbs fine, and to 1 cup of crumbs add 1-3 cup softened butter and 1-4 cup sugar. Press firmly on sides and bottom of buttered pie plate and chill. Filling:

Sprinkle gelatin over cold water and allow to soften. Combine fruit, juice and sugar, cook about 5 minutes. Stir in gelatin, lemon juice and salt. Chill. When mixture begins
 to thicken, fold in cream which has been whipped stiff. Pour into pie shell, and chill until well set.<br>

Note: Fresh uncooked pineapple will not congeal in gelatin mixture. There are lots of things you can do with fresh pineapple, but for molded desserts and salads you will
 have to use cooked or canned pineapple. Almost daily some imaginatie and enterprising woman phones to ask why her gelatin will not congeal, after hs she has put fresh
 pineapple in it. It just won't."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Shepherd's pie</b></font><br>
The English tradition of meat pies dates back to the Middle ages. Game pie, pot pie and <a href="foodmeats.html#sheep">
mutton</a>
pie were popular and served in pastry "coffyns." These pies were cooked for hours in a slow
oven,
and topped with rich aspic jelly and other sweet spices. The eating of "hote [meat] pies" is
mentioned in <i>Piers Plowman</i>, and English poem written in the 14th Century. (<i>Cooking
of the
British Isles</i>, Adrian Bailey, pages 156-7) The Elizabethans favored minced pies. "A typical
Elizabethan recipe ran:  Shred your meat (mutton or beef) and suet together fine. Season it with
cloves, mace, pepper and some saffron, great raisins and prunes..." (<i>Food and Drink in Britain:
From the Stone Age to the 19th Century</i>, C. Anne Wilson, page 273). About <a
href="christmasfood.html#mincemeat">mince and mincemeat pies</a>. Maine style <a href="foodpies.html#chinesepie">Chinese Pie</a> descends from 
this venerable culinary tradition.
<p>
The key to dating Shepherd's pie is the introduction (and acceptance) of <a
href="http://www.cup.org/books/kiple/potatoes.htm">potatoes</a> in England.
Potatoes are a new world food. They were first introduced to Europe in 1520 by the Spanish.
Potatoes did not appeal to the British palate until the 18th Century. (<i>Foods America Gave the
World</i>, A. Hyatt Verrill, page 28). Shepherd's Pie, a dish of minced meat (usually lamb, when
made with beef it is called <a href="foodpies.html#cottagepie">"Cottage Pie"</a>) topped with mashed
potatoes was probably invented
sometime in the 18th Century by frugal peasant housewives looking for creative ways to serve
leftover meat to their families. It is generally agreed that it originated in the north of England and
Scotland where there are large numbers of sheep--hence the name. The actual phrase "Shepherd's
Pie" dates back to the 1870s, when mincing machines made the shredding of meat easy and
popular." (<i>The Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson, page 717). Related dishes: <a href="foodpies.html#chinesepie">Chinese

<b>Where does "Cottage Pie" fit in?</b><br>
"In present day English, <i>cottage pie</i> is an increasingly popular synonym for <a href="foodpies.html#shepherdspie"><i>shepherd's
pie</i></a>, a dish of minced meat with a topping of mashed potato. Its widening use is no doubt due
in part to its pleasantly bucolic associations, in part to the virtual disappearance of mutton and
lamb from such pies in favour of beef...But in fact, <i>cottage pie</i> is a much older term than
<i>shepherd's pie</i>, which does not crop up until the 1870s; on 29 August 1791 we find that
enthusiastic recorder of all his meals, the Reverend James Woodford, noting in his diary  Dinner
to day, Cottage-Pye and rost Beef' (it is not clear precisely what he meant by <i>cottage pie</i>,
however)."<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p.

<p>
"The term cottage pie, often confused with shepherd's pie but probably denoting a similar dish
made with minced beef, has a somewhat longer history and is similarly effective in evoking a rural
and traditional context."<br>

Mutton and beef pies are found in Medieval British texts. Minced meat pies were favored during
the Tudor
years. Minced mutton and potato recipes begin showing up in the 18th century. These dishes are
listed by various names. The oldest recipe we have for something called "Shepherd's Pie" is dated
1886:<p>

"Cottage Pie</b><br>
Required: a pound and a half of cooked potatoes, half a pound to three-quarters of cold meat,
seasoning and gravy as below. Cost, about 9d. The potatoes must be nicely cooked and mashed
while hot...The should be seasoned, and beaten until light with a wooden spoon. A pie dish should
then be greased, and the potatoes put at the bottom, to form a layer from half to an inch in
thickness. The meat should be made into a thick mince of the usual kind with stock or gravy...or it
may be mixed with Onion Sauce, or any other which may be sent to table with meat. The nicer the
mince, the nice, of course, will be the pie. The meat goes next, and should be put in the centre of
the bottom layer, leaving a little space all around. Then drop the remainder of the potatoes on the
top, beginning at the sides--this prevents the boiling out of the gravy when the meat begins to
cook--go on until all the used, making the pie highest in the middle. Take a fork, and rough the
surface all over, because it will brown better than if left smooth. For a plain dish, bake it for
fifteen to twenty minutes. Or it may be just sprinkled with melted dripping (a brush is used for
this), or it may be coated with beaten egg, part of which may then be used in the mashed potatoes.
As soon as the pie is hot through and brown, it should be served. There are many recipes for this
pie, or variation of it, and in some, directions are given for ptuting the meat in the dish first, and
all the potatoes on the top. The plan above detailed will be found the better, because the meat
being enveloped entirely in potatoes runs no risk of becoming hard, as it wold do it exposed to the
direct heat of the oven. Any other cooked vegetables may be added to the above, but they should
be placed between the meat and potatoes, both top and bottom. If a very savoury pie is desired,
make the mince very moist, and allow longer time for baking. The potatoes will absorb some of
the gravy, and found tasty. In this case, the heat must not be fierce at starting, only at the end for
the pie to brown well. For a richer pie, allow a larger proportion of meat. For a very cheap one,
half a pound of meat will do for two pounds of potatoes."<br>

<b>"Tinned Meat, Shepherd's Pie</b><br>
Required: two pounds of meat, half-a-pint of canned tomatoes, half-a-pound of fried onions, salt
and black pepper, and any herbs preferred, four pounds of potatoes, and some gravy. Cost, 1s. 6d.
To 1s. 8d. First grease a deep baking dish with some of the melted fat from the tin. Boil or steam
the potaotes, mash and season them ...and put them in an inch thick at the bottom and sides of the
dish. Then put the onions all over the potato layer. Mince the meat, add the jelly from it, and the
tomatoes, with a little more stock or plain gravy of any sort; pile this in the centre of the dish; put
the remainder of the potatoes thickly on the top; rough the surface with a fork, and bake until well
browned in a moderate oven about three-quarters of anhour. The potatoes will absorb some of the
gravy and be very savoury. The dish is an excellent one, considering its small cost. If liked, some
pork can be added, and apple sauce used instead of the tomatoes. Tinned ox-tails, ox cheek,
kidney, &c., may take the place of the beef or mutton. Either will provide a hot, cheap meal in a
short time."<br>

"A chocolate pie filling should be [1] smooth and creamy, [2] thick enough to transfer from pie pan to dessert plate

 filling should not be [1] lumpy, [2] starchily stiff, [3] overly sweet, bitter, or gray in cast. A good recipe is half

1 baked 9 inch pie shell <br>
2 egg whites <br>
1/4 teaspoon salt <br>
4 tablespoons sugar<br> 
Add chocolate to milk and heat in the top of a double boiler over boiling water. When chocolate has melted beat it into
 the milk with a rotary egg beater. Mix the sugar, flour, cornstarch, and salt together and add gradually to the milk and 
chocolate mixture, stirring at the same time. Stir constantly and cook the mixture until it is thick enough for the spoon 
to leave a streak or indentation. Then continue cooking 10 to 15 minutes longer, stirring frequently in order to cook the 
starch thoroughly. Beat the egg yolks slightly and vigorously to mix in the egg yolks thoroughly before they can coagulate.
 Cook for two minutes longer. Remove from stove, add butter and vanilla, and cool. Turn into cooled baked pastry shell. 
Beat egg whites and salt until the eggs are foamy. Add sugar a little at a time and continue beating until all sugar is 
dissolved and egg white will stand in peaks. Pile lightly on the chocolate filling from outside to inside, making certain
 that the meringue touches the pastry at the edges. Bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes, or until meringue is well browned. 
A third egg white and two extra tablespoons of sugar will make a higher meringue. Coconut may be sprinkled over the top 
before the browning. Or the meringue may be left off the pie entirely and a sweetened whipped cream topping used instead. 
Chopped dates and nuts and a little vanilla flavoring add interest to a whipped cream topping for chocolate pie."<br>

<b>Chinese Pie, Maine style</b><br>
 The general concensus of our food history books and database searches is that "Chinese Pie"
 also known as "Pate Chinois"  is a regional favorite of New England and Quebec. The recipe is similar to 
<a href="foodpies.html#shepherdspie">Shepherd's pie</a>.
<p>
There is no obvious connection between this dish and traditional Chinese cuisine. Why the name? There are three theories: 
<p>
(1) The name was bestowed by French Canadians who first encountered the dish while living in a tiny town called China, Maine. These
skilled workers were mill employees. When the Canadians moved on (back home or to other New England mill towns), they 
brought their Chinese Pie recipes with them. 
<p>
(2) This dish was made by Chinese workers employed by Canadian railways and was adopted by the locals. 
<a href="http://www42.statcan.ca/smr04/2005/03/smr04_07405_04_e.htm">Chinese immigration to  Canada</a>.
But??? This does not explain why only the French Canadians call this dish Chinese Pie (pate chinois)? 
<p>
(3) Maybe the connection has more to do with the preparation (chopping up several ingredients and cooking them together)
rather than the finished dish.  Think:
<a href="foodasian.html#chopsuey">chop suey</a>.
New Englanders are also famous for their American chop suey (a chopped beef, vegetable, and tomato
casserole). Both dishes are particularly connected with Maine. Chinese pie was a regular entree on Maine public school
 lunch menus in the 1960s; and popular throughout New England in from the 1970s forward. Coincidence? Maybe.
<p>
"China pie. A meat pie named "pate chinois" is found on menus in small, family-style
 Quebec restaurants. It has no connection with Chinese cuisine. It's a French-Canadian
 term for shepherd's pie, the combination of ground-up cooked meat, gravy, and mashed
 potatoes. The name was traced by Quebec food historian Claude Poirier to a town in the
 state of Maine called China. In the late 19th century, thousands of Quebecers migrated

<b>Rappie Pie</b><br>
Our sources confirm Rappie Pie (Pate a la Rapure) is a popular savory pie traditionally associated with Acadia. It 
descends from the same culinary tradition as <a href="foodpies.html#shepherdspie">Shepherd's Pie</a>, combining grated potatoes and minced (leftover) meats. It is
 a thrifty dish that satisfies the belly. 
<p>
"Rapure is anything that has been grated; in the case of this familiar Acadian main course, it's grated raw potatoes. This is yet again a dish of 
necessity, for, in pioneer times, the grated raw potatoes were squeezed dry in a cotton bag, and the 'potato water' was used as 
starch when the seek's laundry was cone. After removal of the 'starch water,' the potatoes were mashed in with whatever meat was being 
used, perhaps salt pork or chicken or seafood, plus onions, eggs, and seasonings like summer savory, coriander, salt and pepper. It goes by 
variant names, like pate rape or chiard, depending on which part of Acadia you're making it in. There are also several distinct 
methods of making rappie pie, another of which involves making a broth of the chicken or clams or mussels or rabbit, and as part of the 
preparation, scalding the squeezed potatoes in this broth. Le Pate in Acadian is the traditional meat pie. The French word pate has an 
interesting etymology. Before 1165, it was spelled paste, stemming from Vulgar Latin pasta, itself from Greek paste 'flour sauce.' ... 
Every region of Acadia has its local meat pie, and not just for supper. Some pates are served for breakfast or even as midnight, after-skating 
snacks. In some places in New Brunswick, variations consisting of miniature, folded pates...are called petits cochons (piggly wigs), little 
lunar crescents of golden-brown crust enclosing juicy bits of pork, chicken, potatoes, and onions." <br>

<p>
<blockquote>
<b>"Pate a la Rapure</b> (Rappie Pie)<br>
Probably the most popular of all the Acadian recipes is Pate a la Rapure, commonly called Rappie Pie. It is still served on 
festive occasions, and in many homes, for Sunday dinner.<p>
You will need a grater; a large pan, measuring at least 17"X12X2"; a cloth bag, preferably a small flour bag, since it must be
sturdy and yet allow the water and starch to be squeezed through<br>
1 peck potatoes<br>
2 chickens, 2-3 1/2 pounds each<br>
2-3 large onions<br>
1/4 pound butter<br>
6 strips bacon<br>
Salt and pepper to taste<br>
Poultry seasoning<br>
Cook chickens in a large pot on top of the stove with plenty of seasoning and onions, before you start grating your
potatoes, so that the juice of the meat will be hot and ready for use. When the chickens are cooked, separate meat from the bones
and cut into pieces. In the meantime, peel potatoes and soak in cold water so they will stay white. Grate about 10 potatoes at
a time and then place in the cloth bag and squeeze until all water and starch is removed. Do all potatoes in this way. Do not discard the 
liquid form the potatoes until it has been measured, for an equal amount of the hot chicken broth must be measured to replace the
potato liquid. When potatoes are all squeezed, loosen them in a large pan, measure the chicken broth and gradually add to the potatoes, 
stirring slowly. When potatoes are cooked enough they will take on a jelly-like appearance. Be sure there are no lumps. Add
seasonings, and stir, stir, stir! Cover bottom of well-greased pan with half of the potato mixture. Arrange pices of chciken, 
chopped onions and pats of butter on top, distributing evenly. Cover with the other half of potato mixture. Then add a bit of chopped
onion, more pats of butter, and a few strips of bacon. This will help to form the crust. Place pie in a hot oven (400 degrees)
for aobut 2 hours, or until a brown crust is formed. This is delicious with apple sauce or cranberry sauce. Serve piping hot.
Will serve approximately 12 persons."<br>

Remove the meat from the broth and break it up with a fork. Peel 12 large potatoes. Grate them and squeeze in a bag, letting the starchy water
drain into a bowl. Allow this water to set. Drain off the clear liquid and add the starch sediment to the potatoes. Pack tightly in a
bowl and cover it for a few minutes with a cold, wet cloth. Place the potatoes and 3 onions, raw, sliced, in a warm dish. Add
the boiling broth gradually, beating constantly, and season with 1/4 tsp. thyme, 1/4 tsp. savory and salt and pepper to taste.
Put in a dish previously greased with hot, melted lard. Place one layer of potatoes, one layer of hot meat and one layer of

Shoofly pie has such an interesting name, it must have an equally interesting history. It certainly
does!
<p>
Many food history reference books attribute the origin of shoofly pie to the Pennslyvania Dutch.
A closer examination of
culinary evidence suggests this group may be able to claim the name, but maybe not the recipe.
This  resiliant sugar-based formula is capable of adapting through the ages according to ingredient
availability and
cook ingenuity. Food historians tell us sugar-filled pastries originated in the Ancient Middle East.
Sweet treacle pies
were popular all over Medieval Europe. Renaissance diners preferred similar compostions made
with fine white sugar.
These recipes were introduced to America by European settlers from several nations. Molasses
was often substituted for
treacle in colonial American recipes. Some folks say the "original shoofly recipe" is descended
from <a

Centennial
cake</a>.  Both desserts
have striking similarities.



<p>

<b>WHY SHOOFLY?</b>
According to the book <i>Rare Bits, Unusual Origins of Popular Recipes</i>,  by Patricia
Bunning Stevens (p. 262)
shoofly pie was created when "the pie-loving Pennsylvania Dutch ...found themselves short of
baking supplies in the late
winter and early spring...all that was left in the pantry were flour, lard, and molasses. From these
sparse ingredients they
fashioned Shoo-Fly Pie and found that their families liked it so well that they soon made it all year
round. The unusual
name is presumed to come from the fact that pools of sweet, sticky molasses sometimes formed
on the surface of the pie
while it was cooling, inevitably attracting flies."  According to the <i>The Encyclopedia of
American Food
& Drink</i>, by John Mariani (p. 293) the term "Shoo Fly Pie" was not recorded in print until
1926. 
<p>
"Shoofly pie.<br>
In American cuisine, shoofly pie is a sort of treacle tart, made with molasses or brown sugar and
topped with a sugar,
flour, and butter crumble. It's name is generally taken to be an allusion to the fact that it is so
attractive to flies that they
have to be constantly shooed away from it, but the fact that it originated as a Pennsylvania-Dutch
specialty suggests the
possibility that shoofly is an alteration of an unidentified German word."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p.
310-1)
<p>
<b>WHAT IS AMISH SHOOFLY?</b><br>
There are two basic variations on the traditional Amish Shoofly Pie recipe."Traditional" Shoo-fly
pies are made with
either a "wet bottom" (soft filling and crumb topping) or "dry bottom" (crumb topping is mixed
into the filling), which is
commonly served for breakfast."
<p>

If you are looking for a Shoo-Fly pie recipe from the early 18th century, try this one from
"<i>The Thirteen Colonies
Cookbook</i>," by Mary Donovan. On page 135 appears this recipe attributed to Magdelena
Hoch Keim of
Lobachsville, Pennsylvania. (1730--?). This recipe has been modernized for contemporary
kitchens:
<p><blockquote>
<b>Wet-Bottomed Shoofly Pie</b><br>

3/4 cup Flour<br>
1/2 cup brown sugar<br>
1/2 tsp cinnamon<br>
1/8 tsp each nutmeg, ginger, and ground cloves<br>
1/2 tsp salt<br>
2 tablespoons shortening<br>
1 egg yolk, beaten well<br>
1/2 cup barrel molasses<br>
3/4 cup boiling water<br>
1/2  tsp baking soda<br>
Piecrust dough for 9-inch pie
<p>
Combine flour, sugar, spices, and salt with the shortening. Work into crumbs with your hands.
Add beaten egg yolk to
molasses. Pour boiling water over soda until dissolved; then add to molasses mixture. Line a
9-inch pie plate with pastry
and fill it with the molasses mixture. Top with the crumb mixture. Bake at 400 degrees until the
crust browns, about 10
minutes. Reduce to 325 degrees and bake firm.
</blockquote><br>
Original recipes for "molasses pie" read like this:<p><blockquote>
Four eggs--beat the Whites separate--one Teacupful of brown Sugar, half a Nutmeg, two
Tablespoonfuls of Butter; beat them will together; stir in one Teacupful and a half of Molasses,
and then add the Whites
of Eggs. Bake on Pastry. <br>

<b>Why are sweet potatoes pies sometimes served with marshmallows?</b><br>
During the late 19th/early 20th century marshmallows were very trendy. Mass-manufactured,
plentiful and
inexpensive, they were agressively promoted by food companies. Campfire Brand is one of the oldest. Marshmallows were incorporated into cakes, pies, gelatin desserts, hot chocolate, candies,  and
the like.
Marshmallows were promoted as a moden whipped cream substitute. About <a
href="foodcandy.html#marshmallows"> marshmallows</a>. The earliest recipes we find
combining sweet
potatoes (& to a lesser extent, yams) with marshmallows date to the 1920s. 
According to
these recipes, marshmallows were layered casserole-style or placed on top of the finished dish for decoration. Candied yams 
were sometimes served with marshmallows.
Coincidentally, many signature dishes of the 1920s were exceptionally sweet. Some food historians hypothesize this was a tasteful
reaction to Prohibition.
<blockquote>
<b>[1921]</b><br>
"I sometimes serve sweet potatoes in this way: Pare and boil medium-sized sweet potatoes until tender and remove and place in a
pan in this way: One layer of the sweet potatoes, sliced; a little sugar sprinkled over the slices, a thin layer of marshmallows 
cut into small pieces, and then another layer of the sliced sweet potatoes--and so repeat the order of these layers till the dish
is full; finish with the marshmallow layer. Set the dish in the oven and let bake until the marshmallows melt and are brown on

"Sweet potato...the most important of the tropical root crops, is the starch tuber of a vine of the
...morning glory family. It is not related to the ordinary potato, although both plants
are of American origin. The sweet potato is the cultivated descendant of a wild plant, the remains
of whose tubers have been found in a cave in Peru inhabited before 8000BC. It was taken into
cultivation during the last centuries BC, well before the time of the Incas, and became a staple
food all over tropical America as far north as Mexico and on the Caribbean islands. It is likely that
it was during the 13th century AD that the sweet potato was taken westward to Easter Island
and Hawaii, and in the next century to New Zealand...The first European to taste sweet potatoes
were members of Columbus' expedition to Haiti, in 1492...Early accounts give various local

<b>Sweet potatoes in China</b><br> 
"It is generally accepted that the sweet potato reached China at the end of the 16th century. There was a famine in Fujian province in 1593 and 
the governor sent an expedition to the Philippines to search for food plants. Next year the ships returned with sweet potatoes, which soon 
became a staple of that part of China. Early in the 18th century the sweet potato passed into Japan. The fact that it is called karaimo 
(i.e. Chinese potato) in the Ryuku Island (Okinawa), ryukyu-imo in Satsuma, and satsumaimo in the rest of the country is said to indicate the
 route by which it arrived."<br>

"China. Ping-Tio Ho writes that two theories exist for the introduction of sweet potatoes into China. The first involves an overseas merchant to brought the plants from Luzon, which were given to the governor of Fukein in 1594 to alleviate a famine...The second claim suggests that sweet potatoes arrived via the southern port of Chang-chou, but no specific date of this alleged introduction is known...Ping-Ti Ho indicates that whereas the former story may be true, the sweet potato was already in China by 1594, having been observed by 1563 in the western prefecture Ta-li, near Burma...Ho concludes that the introduction could have been either overland or by sea via India or Burma, well before the generally accepted date of 1594."<br>

<b>Sweet potatoes in Japan</b><br> 
"Far more important in the history of food than naban cooking and confection, in terms of socioeconomic impact, were the cultivable vegetables of New World origin which arrived during this period. Spaniards and Portuguese brought the new corps to Southeast Asia and China, and they reached Japan through the efforts not only of Europeans but also Chinese traders, as well as Okinawans and Japanese who did business in various parts of Asia. The sweet potato was the most influential of the new crops. Having been introduced by Spaniards to Luzon in the Philippines, it spread to the Chinese province of Fujian in 1593. Potted seedlings were taken from there to the Ryuku kingdom (now Okinawa) in 1605 by a returning envoy, and it was soon put in cultivation all over the Ruyku Islands. The first cultivation of the sweet potato on the main islands of Japan was in a field planted by Richard Cocks, the manager of the East India Company office in Hirado, who brought it from the Ryukyus. Therafter it was widely cultivated in the warm and dry maritime districts of western Japan, and was steamed, boiled or grilled for daily consumption. It became very important as a staple food, particularly in areas geographically unsuitable for the establishment of paddy fields: Okinawa, southern Kyushu, the Bungo Channel coasts of Kyushu and Shikoku, Tsushima Island, and the islands of the Inland sea. In some places sweet potatoes became the source for at least 60 per cent of the food energy intake of the local population...In locals where rice production was low and habitation was sparse, there was perceptible population growth following the introduction of the sweet potato." <br>

"All recipes for potatoes were for sweet, or Spanish potatoes. The white, or Virginia, potato so-called because Sir Walter Raleigh brought it back to England from Virginia, 
or so it was thought, was barely known during Shakespeare's lifetime. Spanish potaotes, introduced by the Spaniards, who found them in South America, were known in 
England around the middle of the sixteenth century. William Harrison mentions them in the 1577 edition of <i>The Description of England</i>, but recipes for them do not 
appear in English cookbooks until the 1580s, when Thomas Dawson offered the recipe, much quoted by social historians of Tudor England, on how 'to make a tart that is 
a courage to a man or woman.' The recipe combines potatoes with the brains of cock robins, among other ingredients, making it clear to Elizabethans that it was a dish 
with aphrodesiac possibilities. The aphrodesiac reputation of cock robbins' brains and sweet potatoes was accepted by educated people as well as by the medical 
profession. Sir Thomas Elyot in his <i>Castle of Health</i>, does not mention robins, but notes that 'sparrowes be hard to digest, and are very hot, and stirreth up Venus, 
and especially the brains of them.' Shakespeare mentions potatoes twice, both times with lecherous connotations."<br>

<b>Sweet potatoes in North America</b><br>
Like their <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/books/kiple/potatoes.htm">white potato</a> [Virginia] cousins, sweet potatoes were introduced to North America via Europe.
<p>
"The sweet potato, Ipomoea batatas, and the white potato, Solanum tuberosum, both plants from the New World were not remotely 
related, yet their identities were hopelessly entangled in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Sources, even highly regarded 
ones, are contradictory, not to say self-contradictory. Turner, in 1548, makes no mention of either potato, but in 1577, Harrison 
speaks of 'the potato and such venerous roots as are brought out of Spaine, Portingale, and the Indies to furnish up our bankets 
[banquets]. By 1586, there appears in Thomas Dawson's The Good Huswifes Jewell, Part 1, a recipe entitled: To make a tart that is a 
courage to man or woman, that calls for Potaton...In 1597, Gerard correctly identified the two plants. (He was by no 
means the first to have done so, but his work was popular and had clear drawings.) He called sweets simply Potatoes, saying that 
they grew in Spain; what he called Potatoes of Virginia are whites...This nomenclature persisted til nearly mid-century. Both kinds grew 
in his garden, Gerard days, but the sweet potatoes 'perished' of damp and cold. Sweet potatoes 'comfort, nourish, and strengthen 
the body...' he claims...The potatoes of Shakespeare were sweet potatoes, and they were frequently sliced and conserved with sugar 
exactly as eryngo roots. Markham, in 1615, mentions potatoes at least twice: in a recipe for Olepotrige, a dish from Spaine, and again 
in discussing a potato pie; they could only have been sweet potatoes. It seems to have take several decades for the Virginia 
potato to make from horticultural displays to general cultivation...The sweet potato was never cultivated in Britain, but trade with Spain 
was lively and continued to flourish; the price was high, but such white potatoes as reached the market, around mid-century, were nearly 
as dear. As for the potatoes in our manuscript...we can only speculate as to what was in the mind of the copyist, possible as late as 
the second half of the seventeenth century." <br>

"On the North American mainland sweet potatoes had long
been grown by the Indians in Louisiana, where de Soto found them in 1540, and as far north as
Georgia. By 1648 the colonists in Virginia were cultivating them. The sweet potato was especially
valued during the war against the British and the Civil War, for it grows quickly and its
underground habit makes it less vulnerable than surface crops to deliberate destruction."<br>

<p>
"Sweet potatoes are mentioned as one of the cultivated products of Virginia in 1648, perhgaps in 1610 and are mentioned
again by Jefferson, 1781. They are said to have been introduced into New England in 1764 and to have comne into general
use. John Lowell says that sweet potatoes of excellent quality can be raised about Boston, but they are of no agricultural
importance in this region. In 1773, Bartram saw plantations of swet potatoes about Indian villages in the South, and Romans refer to their use by
the Indians of Florida in 1775."<br>

<b>About yams</b><br>
"Yams existed at least as far back as the beginning of the Jurassic era, when dinosaurs had not yet
been succeeded by mammals and S. America and Asia were still joined. After the continents
separated at the end of the Cretaceous era, the evolution of American yams proceeded separately,
but they are still not much different from their Old World relatives. The differences between Asian
and African yams, which were separated only in historic times by the drying up of the intervening
land, Arabia, are also slight...Even within the main cultivated species, yams vary to a remarkable
extent in size, shape, and colour...The origin of the word   yam'...story goes the Portuguese slave
traders, watching Africans digging up some roots, asked what they were called. Failing to
understand the question aright, the Africans replied that is was    something to eat', "nyami" in
Guinea. This became "inhame" in Portuguese and then "igname" in French and "yam" in
English."<br>
---<i>The Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford]
1999 (p. 856)
<p>
African yams enjoy a rich and interesting history, figuring prominently in cultural traditions.
"Dioscorea cayenesi"  is the principal species grown in West Africa. The African name for this
vegetable is "allato."
<p>
"While much emphasis had been placed on cereal cultivation, there is increasing evidence that
tubers also played an important role in African diets as well and seem to date back to 18,000 to
17,000 years ago. Yams became so important within the western section of the continent that they
took on mythical proportions. Festivities mark their planting and harvesting in countries like
Ghana and Nigeria...It is generally agreed upon by botanists that certain species of yams were first
protected and later domesticated in the tropical rainforest zone of western Africa..."<br>

"The Yam Spirit was a powerful force present in much of Oceania and in Nigeria as well. Yam
planting in Nigeria, as in the Oceanian lands, was accompanied by elaborate rituals. In Nigeria, the
Yam Spirit, called Ifejilku by some, has a special cult...The yam ceremonies performed in these
cultures are similar to agricultural rites surrounding numerous other crops throughout the
world..."<br>

<B>When is a sweet potato not a sweet potato?</b><br>
17th-18th century English and American cookbooks contained recipes for both white and sweet potatoes. Generally, when sweet 
potatoes are used, the ingredient is spelled out. But? Not all sweet potato recipes employed sweet potatoes. Sometimes the 
word "sweet" was employed as an adjective. Mary Randolph's "Sweet Potato Buns" is a classic example. This recipe used sugar 
to sweeten the mashed white potato. Potato breads (flour, mashed) were popular substitutes for traditional wheaten loaves. The 
starch in the potato produced excellent breadstuffs. Today, potato bread is a regular fixture in most supermarkets. 
Mrs. Randolph was Thomas Jefferson's cousin and contemporary. Presumably, his recipe would have mirrored hers. Of course, it is 
totally possible that he used sweet potatoes instead of white. 
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>[1824] </b><br>
"Sweet potato buns (facsimile) are sweet buns made with white potato. Mrs. Randolph always specified sweet potato when so intended (see 
Sweet-Potato Pudding, for example). Similar rolls made with sweet potato came to be a Virginia specialty, however, so that a case may 
be made for either." <br>

"Sweet Potato Buns. Boil and mash a potato, rub into it as much four as will make it like a bread, add spice an sugar to your taste, with a 
spoonful of yeast; when it has risen well, work in a piece of butter; bake it in small rolls, to be eaten hot with butter, either 
for breakfast or for tea." <br>

<b>Contemporary confusion</b><br>
"The confusion with the true yam came from the habit of slaves calling the American sweet potato
by an African word (either Gullah njam, Senegal, nyami, or Vai, djambi) meaning "to eat." The
word was first recorded in America in 1676."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New
York] 1999 (p. 318)
<p>
"The sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas, not remotely related to either the white potato or true yam)
is
native to tropical America and is mentioned in 1494 as growing in Hispaniola by Chanca,
physician to the fleet of Columbus, according to Sturtevant. The confusion started with potato,
from Haitian batata (<i>OED</i>), came to be applied no only to sweet potatoes but also to
papas, an
Inca name for white potato, thus endlessly entangling their identities in early chronicles. Gerard in
his <i>Herball</i> (1597) correctly identified them: sweets, already well known in England, he
called simply Potatoes, saying that they grew in "...Spaine, and other hot regions."<br>

<a name="tarts">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Tarts</b></font><br>
Food historians tell us tarts were introduced in Medieval times. Like pies, they could be savoury
or sweet. Generally, the difference between a tart and a pie is the former does not contain a top
crust. This made tarts a popular choice for cooks who wanted to present colorful dishes. 
<p>
"The term 'tart' occurs in the 14th century recipe compilation the Forme of Cury [a cook book],
and so does its diminutive 'tartlet'. The relevant recipes are for savour items containing meat. A
mixture of savour and sweet was common in medieval dishes and typical of the elaborate,
decorative tarts and pies which were served at banquets. There was, however, a perceptible trend
towards sweet tarts. These usually contained egg custard and fruits of various kinds, which could
be used to provide the brillant colours of which medieval cooks were fond: red, white, and pale
green from fruits; strong green from spinach, which was used in sweet tarts; yellow from egg,
with extra colour from saffron; and black from
dark-coloured dried
fruits. There are many 16th century recipes for coloured  tartstuffs'."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
785)

<p>
"Tart...In America, the word tart tends to indicate a small individual open pastry case with a
sweet, usually fruit filling. In Britian, this usage survives in the particular context of jam tarts, but
on the whole tart refers to a larger version of this, with jam, fruit, or custard filling, that is cut into
slices for serving, or to a similar fruit-filled pastry case with a crust--in other words, a fruit pie."

Savory (meat, vegetables) and sweet (fruit, cheese, custard, jam), dozens of  recipes are offered to

<blockquote>
<b>[1747]<br>
"To made different Sorts of tarts</b><br>
If you bake in tin Patties, butter them, and you must put a little Crust all over, because of the
taking them out: If  in China, or Glass, no Crust but the top one. Lay fine Sugar at the Bottom,
then your Plumbs, Cherries, or any other Sort of Fruit, and Sugar at Top; then put on your Lid,
and bake tem in a slack Oven. Mince-pies must be baked in Tin patties; because of taking them
out, and Puff-paste is best for them. All Sweet Tarts the beaten Crust if best; but as you fancy.
You have the Receipt for the Crusts in this Chapter. Apple, Pear, Apricock, &c. Make thus:
Apples and Pears, pare them, cut them in Quarters, and core them; cut the Quarters a-cross again,
set them on in a Sauce-pan with just as much Water as will barely cover them, let them simmer on
a slow Fire just till the Fruit is tender; put a good Piece of Lemon-peel in the Water with the Fruit,
then have your Patties ready. Lay fine Sugar at Bottom, then your Fruit, and a little Sugar at Top;
that you must put in at your Discretion. Pour over each Tart a Tea Spponful of Lemon-juice, and
three Tea Spoonfuls of the Liquor they were boiled in; put on your Lid, and bake them in a slack
Oven. Apricocks do the same Way; only don't use Lemon. As to Preserved Tarts, only lay in your
preserved Fruit, and put a very thin Crust at Top, and let them be baked as little as possible; but if
you would make them mice, have a large patty, the Size you would have your Tart. Make your
Sugar-Crust, roll it as thick as a Halfpenny; then butter your Patties, and cover it; shape your
Upper-crust on a hollow Tin of purpose, the Size of your Patty, and mark it with a Marking-iron
for that purpose, in what Shape you please, to be hollow and open to see the Fruit through; then
bake your Crust in a very slack Oven, not to discolour it, but to have it crisp. When the Crust is
cold, very carefully take it out, and fill it with what Fruit you please, ay on the Lid, and it is done;
therefore if the Tart is not eat, your Sweet-meat is not the sorse, and it looks genteel."<br>

<b>ABOUT APPLES IN ENGLAND</b><br>
"The Romans introduced new economic plants. The had already developed several apple varieties,
with fruits smaller than those of today but larger and sweeter than those borne by Britain's
indigenous wild crabs...Their apple varieties included types for good keeping, and villa owers
stored them spread out in rows in a dry, well-ventilated loft...Apples were sliced into two or three
pieces with a redd or bone knife (since metal stained the fruit), and were put to lie in the
sun."<br>

[Academy Chicago:Chicago] 1991 (p. 325-6)
<p>
<b>ABOUT ORANGES IN ENGLAND</b><br>
"The first Englishmen to enjoy oranges, lemons...were probably the crusaders who wintered with
Richard Coeur-de-Lion in the fruit groves around Jaffa in 1191-2. About a hundred years later
citrus fruits had begun to arrive in England itself. Fifteen lemons and seven oranges, together with
two hundred and thirty pomegranates and some dried fruits were brougth from a Spanish ship at
Portsmouth in 1289 for Queen Eleanor...The Southern fruits were very expensive at that
time...The oranges that reached England in those days were always bitter, of the type of the
Seville orange. From the end of fourteenth century the consignments became more frequent,
coming in from Spain or Portugal, or on the Italian spice ships. Not only were citrus fruits
themselves imported, but also confectionery made from them."<br>
---<i>Food and Drink in Britain: From the Stone Age to the 19th Century</i>, C. Anne Wilson
[Academy Chicago:Chicago] 1991 (p. 332-3)
<p>
"The same ships that carried spices also tended to carry fruit, such as oranges, of which a
surprising number were brought to England. These were frequently imported in the tens of
thousands per ship, and occasionally as many as a hundred thousand (in March 1480). These
oragnes were probably always a bitter variety. For customs purposes they were declared at about
ten for 1d."<br>
---<i>Food and Feast in Medieval England</i>, P.W. Hammond [Wren's Press:Gloucestershire]
1998 (p. 11)
<p>
"Besides the food associated with certain occasions there was luxury food which was served
whenever it could be obtained and which was intended to delight and impress. One such food was
fruit. A better-off person's meal in the sixteenth century finished with fruit...Henry VIII's meals
also ended with fruit, although exactly what fruit is not specified apart from the fact that oranges
and pippins (a variety of apples) are often included on the menu. Ordinary people could also enjoy
the fruit they grew in their own gardens, but imported luxuries like oranges were far beyond their
means."<br>

<b>About pear tarts</b><br>
Baked pears (in syrup/wine/spices) were recorded in Anient Roman texts. They were also quite
popular in Medieval Europe. Sample  <a

<p>
Likewise? Tarts (generally pies-like recipes without top crusts) were known during these
times. The earliest printed evidence we find for pear pie in an English cookbook  is from
1615. Gervase Markham's English Huswife contains a recipe for "A warden pie." Wardens
were a particular kind of pear. Robert May's <i>Accomplisht Cook</i> [1685] contains
this recipe:
<blockquote>
<b>"To make a Warden or a Pear Tart quartered.</b><br>
Take twenty good wardens, pare them, and cut them in a tart, and put to them two pound of
refined sugar, twenty whole cloves, a quarter of an ounce of cinnamon broke into little bits,
and three races of ginger pared and slic't thin; then close up the tart and bake it, it will ask
five hours baking, then ice it with a quarter of a pound of double refined sugar, rose water,
and butter."<br>
---<i>The Accomplisht Cook</i>, Robert May, facsimile reprint of 1685 edition [Prospect
Books:Devon] 2000 (P. 244)
</blockquote>
<p>
18th century cookbooks often contained recipes for puddings that would be classed today as
tarts:<br>
<blockquote>
"<b>An orange pudding.</b><br>
Boil the rind of a Seville orange very soft, beat it in a marble mortar with the juice. Put ot it two
Naples biscuits grated very fine, half a pound of butter, a quarter of a pound of sugar, and the
yolks of six eggs. Mix them well together, lay a good puff paste round the edge of your china
dish, bake in a gentle oven half an hour. You may make a lemon pudding the same way but
putting in a lemon instead of the orange."<br>

<b>About Tart Tatin</b><br>
Arguably, the most famous of all French tarts! Happy accident or stroke of genius? You decide...<p>

"Tarte Tatin, an upside-down French apple tart. The <i>Larousse Gastronomique</i> explains that the
name commemorates the Tatin sisters, who popularized it in their restaurant at Lamotte-Beuvron,
to the south of Orleans, in the early 20th century. Later in the century, chefs devised variations,
using pear, pineapple, or rhubarb, to give but three examples."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 785)
<p>
"Tatin. The name given to a tart of caramelized apples that is cooked under a lid of pastry and
then inverted to be served with the pastry underneath and the fruit on top. This delicious tart, in
which the taste of caramel is combined with the flavour of apples cooked in butter under a golden
crispy pastry crust, established the reputation of the Tatin sisters, who ran a hotel-restaurant in
Lamotte-Beuvron at the beginning of the 20th century. However, the  upside down' tart, made of
apples or pears, is an ancient specialty of Sologne and is found throughout Orleanais. Having
been made famous by the Tatin sisters, it was first served in Paris at Maxim's, where it remains a
specialty to the present day."<br>
---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, Completely Revised and Updated [Clarkson Potter:New York] 2001
(p. 1198)<br>
[NOTE: The original Larousse Gastronomique (1938) contains information on apple tarts but
does not make reference to Tarte Tatin.]
<p>
"...How these Tatin girls accidentally inventd the famous tart involves a small sally into French social history. The Solognes region
is the paradise of French hunters, a wild, forested area along the upper reaches of the Loire River, near Joan of Arc's City of 
Orleans...The hunters come with dogs and guns to spread out along the forest roads that pass isolated villages where they stay
in small hunting auberges. Most of these tiny inns are owned and run by women who are also superb game cooks...
In one of the villages, Lamotte-Buevren, about 24 miles from Orleans, the Auberge Tatin has been owned by the Tatin family for almost
70 years. The most famous cooks in the family were the Tatin sisters Marie and Jeanne, who ran the auberge about 40 years
ago. As well as their game specialties, they had a dessert that was quite popular with regular visitors. You might call it a kind
of deep-dish one-crust fruit pie. They made it in a copper pan about 9 inches across and 3 inches deep. They neatly filled it with
circles of fruit cut, covered it with a single pastry crust, put a lid and baked it by sliding it under the glowing wood embers in 
the huge hearth. When the crust was golden brown, they carried the pie in its pan to the table. One day, just as she stepped into 
the dining room, Marie Tatin dropped the pan. The pie stayed in the pan, but the crust cracked badly right across its center. In 
a flood of tears, Marie scooped up the pan from the floor and rushed it back to the kitchen. It obviously could not be served 
with the big crack. There was no time to bake another. What could be done? Jeanne had the brilliant idea that was to make them 
famous. Quickly she ran a knife around the edge of the crust and overturned the entire pie onto a serving platter with the cracked
crust underneath. The fruit, now on top, looked very neat, but a bit pale. In a heavy iron skillet Jeanne quickly caramelized some
butter and sugar, then dribbled the shiny golden syrup over the fruit. When Marie carried the newly invented upside-down tart into
the dining room, it we recieved with acclamation. Within a few months, it was being copied all over the Sologne region. Within a 
few years, it was a favorite all over France. For the rest of their lives the Tatin sisters basked in the glory of their tart. 
Thousands of visitors came to their tiny auberge, not to hunt but just for the pleasure of meeting the sisters and looking at the 
circle painted on the floor to mark the spot where the tart fell. Yet the Tatin girls deeply resented all the imitation of their
tart. They struggled for the rest of their lives to keep their recipe a secret. They never published it or even wrote it down, so 
an "authentic recipe" does not exist, only hundreds of different interpretations by other cooks."<br>
---"One Great Dish,"  Roy Andres de Groot, <i>Washington Post</i>, October 14, 1979 (p. K1)

<a name="timbale">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Timbale</b></font><br>

Defining the term "timbale" is a complicated exercise in culinary context. Ingredients, method, purpose, and presentation are period and place dependent. In the
 most basic sense, timbales are fancy molded compositions combining an outer layer of starch (grain, pasta, rice) with fillings (meat, vegetable, fruit). Some are 
layered (similar to contemporary lasagne); others are vertical presentations (similar to vol-au-vent). Timbales can be savory or sweet and served at almost any 
course. The ultimate flexible food application. 
<p>
"Timbale. By definition this word (which comes from Arab <i>thabal</i> meaning drum) means a small metal receptacle, round in shape and mostly intended to hold a 
beverage. Timbales of this kind are chiefly made of silver, sometimes of gold, or sometimes of silver plate, and are of many kinds. Some are simple; others are ornamented.
The word timbale, which in the early days was only applied to individual drinking cups, has taken on a much wider meaning, and is used to describe all sorts of bowls,
of metal, earthenware and china, lagrer than those that our fathers used at table, which were of a size to serve two guests together ...These timbales of the new type were used
chiefly to serve vegetables and food in sauce. In French culinary parlance today the same word is still used in the phrase dresser en timbale to describe the serving of
some preparation in a large bowl, which may be a vegetable dish or leguimier, although used for many other foodstuffs than vegetables. Thus in these timbales-legumiers are served scrambled
eggs, food in sauce, purees, custards and othe prepartions, all to some extent liquid. Dresser en timbale in modern culinary parlance often means to heap the food on a
platter in a pyramid shape, usually garnished. Culinarily the word timbale means a preparation of an kind cooked or served in a pie crust. Timbales of this kind are simply a
sort of hot pie, which instead of being made in a special mould or dish, usualy inged, are made in plain round mould with high sides. These moulds are sometimes
embellished...their sides are either goffered or decorated with motifs or [sic] different kinds. These timbales are filled before cooking with forcemeat and meats of various
sorts...Ther eare many...kinds of timbale which are not filled until after the crust has been cooked...To meet the needs of the ordinary housewife, timbale cases are made
in fireproof porcelain in the same shape and colour as the real pie-crusts. But the true gourmand, is not satisfied with a timbale whose crust is not edible; when served
with a real timbale, this gourmand enjoys not only the contents but the container too."<br>
---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, Prosper Montagne [Crown:New York] 1961 (p. 959) 

<p>
<b>English/Anglo definition</b><br>
According to the [online] <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> the word timbale, in the culinary sense, appeared in in English print in1824:
"2. Cookery. A dish made of finely minced meat, fish, or other ingredients, cooked in a crust of paste or in a mould: so called from its shape. 1824 BYRON Juan
 XV. lxvi. 38 Then there was God knows what ‘à l'Allemande’,..‘timballe’, and ‘Salpicon’. 1866 MRS. GASKELL Wives & Dau. I. xv. 178 Mr. Gibson had to
 satisfy his healthy English appetite on badly-made omelettes, rissoles, vol-au-vents, croquets, and timbales. 1880 ‘OUIDA’ Moths I. 25 Eating her last morsel of a
 truffled timbale. 1899 Westm. Gaz. 16 Sept. 1/3 ‘If I could only have a little sweetbread timbale’, she said longingly. 1908 Daily Chron. 10 Apr. 7/5 Chicken 
Timbales with Sauce." 
<p>
 "Timbales are part of classic French cuisine, and there are numerous specialized recipes...by the end of the nineteenth century it was firmly in place on the best 
Victorian and Edwardian tables."<br>

<p>
<b>Italian applications</b><br>
<p>
"Timballo. Timbale. A dish, often with pasta or rice, made in a form and unmolded. Timballini are small molds. From the Arabic at-tabl (the drum). The most famous
 timballo is the Sicilian timballo di anellini, made with ring-shape dried pasta, balsamello, ground beef and chicken, peas, and vegetables, all wrapped in lettuce
 leaves and baked in a mold. Timballo di crespelle is crepes layered with spinach, ground meat, giblets, mozzarella, and parmigiano, from Abruzzo."<br>
 ---<i>The Dictionary of Italian Food and Drink</i>, John Mariani [Broadway Books:New York] 1998 (p. 257) 
<p>
"Timballo di riso is very simply made, with butter stirred carefully into the rice until each grain is glistening, the timbale then being served with meat, fish, or 
vegetable sauce."<br>
---<i>The Food of Italy</i>, Waverly Root [Vintage Books:New York] 1991 (p. 440) 
<p>
"...popular Abruzzi dishes are...Timballo...based on pancakes, built up in layers with fillings between each two pancakes, built up in layers with filling between each
 two pancakes of previously fried tiny meat balls, small pieces of chicken, peas, mushrooms which have been pre-fried in butter, diced milk with beaten eggs in it,
 meat-and-tomato sauce, and nutmeg..."---<i>ibid</i> (p. 532) 
<p>
"There are homemade dishes, but for holidays and other festive occasions the family may resort to store-bought macaroni, the nearest baker's oven and perhaps 
even to a professional cook for a mess of maccheroni al forno, oven-baked macaroni, for which the pasta is combined with buffalo cheese, sausage and meat balls
 into a sort of pie. This is a festive dish in all three of the southern-most provinces, sometimes under the alternative name of timballo di maccheroni."---<i>ibid</i> (p. 554) 
<p>
"Rice is...the protagonist of tummala [timbale], an elaborate casserole from eastern Sicily, which is said to derive its name from that of Mohammad Ibn Thummah, 
an empire of Catania during the Saracen occupation."<br>
---<i>Pomp and Sustenance: Twenty-Five Centuries of Sicilian Food</i>, Mary Taylor Simeti [Ecco Press:Hopwell NJ]1998 (p. 72) 
<p>
"...Lampedusa's timballo is perhaps the summa of an ancient tradition rather than the product of a single recipe. It is curiously reminiscent of the patina apiciana from
 classical Rome, in which layers of laganum, an early version of lasagna, alternate with layers of chicken, fish, or songbirds. The sugar and the cinnamon recall the
 timbales and the torta described in fourteenth-century Tuscan cookbooks; the ham and truffles sound a note of nineteenth-century France. Its presence on a
 princely table in the middle of the nineteenth century, albeit as a provincial alternative to consomme, speaks volumes about the evolution of the Sicilian 'baronial 
cuisine'."<br>---<i>ibid</i> (p. 182)

<b>Vinegar pie crust?</b><br>
While food historians confirm Vinegar Pie originated in the American midwest, they are curiously silent about Vinegar Pie 
Crust. It is possible the two are connected. Crisco is sometimes cited as an ingredient. We do not, however, find the recipe in 
Crisco's cooking brochures. It is unlikely this was a "corporate kitchen" product.
<p>
The earliest print reference we find in an American newspaper was published in 1968:
<blockquote>
<b>"Vinegar Pastry</b><br>
4 cups sifted flour<br>
1 tbsp. sugar<br>
1 1/2 tsp. salt<br>
1 1/2 cups lard or solid shortening<br>
1 egg, well beaten<br>
1 tbsp. vinegar<br>
1/2 cup cold water<br>
Blend flour, sugar and salt. Cut in lard until particles are the size of small peas. Combine egg, vinegar and water. Sprinkle
over flour mixture, a tablespoonful at a time, mixing in with a fork. Form dough into a ball, divide and roll out as usual. Makes 
two 9-in. crust pies and a pie shell or five 9-in. pie shells."<br>
