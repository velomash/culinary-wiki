The origin & evolution of cookbook clubs (in the UK/USA)  begins in the 18th century and is very much alive today. What makes this topic fascinating is research 
indicates there are 5 distinct definitions of this term, each serving a unique focus and special purpose.

<p>
<b>1. Cook book subscriptions</b><br>
...popular in the 18th century. "Subscribers" were private donors funding the publicaction of the book. They were typically acknowledged
in the beginning of the book by having their names printed. Presumably, part of their investment return was a complimentary
copy of the book.
<p>
"Subscription lists at the front of books, like this one from Hannah Glasse's Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy, named the 
individuals who contributed to the cost of printing the book. Subscription was a common eighteenth-century strategy for writers to get into 
print, and some one hundred individuals contributed to the cost of printed books during the century. Prominent names vouched for the 
quality of the cook and the book. Other books printed by subscription included Vincent La Chapelle's The Modern Cook (1733). In France, 
subscription publishing was called la maniere d'Angleterre. The first edition of Diderot and Alembert's Encyclopedie in 1751 
had four thousand subscribers, despite its high price (1,000 livres)."<br>
---<i>The Cookbook Library</i>, Anne Willan with Mark Cherniavsky and Kyri Claflin [University of California Press:Berkeley CA] 
2012 (p. 210)
<p>
<b>2. Grocery store encyclopedia promotions</b><br>
...selling sets of books on a modified "installment plan" was popular in post WWII America. Books were typically sold in grocery store and other
popular middle-class shopping locations. First volumes (Book 1) were typically free or deep discounted. Subsequent volumes were released on a 
regular schedule for modest sums. This made purchasing large sets of books affordable for average Americans. Funk and Wagnalls
Encyclopedia was sold this way. Food encyclopedias followed with great success. Think: <i>Woman's Day Encyclopedia of Cookery</i> and <i>Family Circle Illustrated 
Library of Cooking</i> (1960s-1970s). 
<p>
"A week ago, Woman's Day Encyclopedia of Cookery finished up the newspaper, television and radio promotion that began on March 
20 to push volume oned of the set of 12 off the shelves of 3,100 Midwest supermarkets. 'The key to the whole continuity book program is to 
get the consuer hooked on number one,' said Ted Barash, 'and they sold more books than they ever had before...The encyclopedia had already been 
sold in New England and the New York area but this would be its introduction to the Midwest...The ads as show are (A) the tried and 
true 'testimonial' approach, (B) what they called the 'heritage' ad, stressing the books' quality that can hold up and be passed on 
from generation to generation, and (C) 'value.'...Each of the three ads would have a coupon with a different return address so that they
could tell which had the greatest pulling power...90 per cent of [consumers] went for the (A) the good old testimonial."<br>
---"Advertising: Selling Sets of Encyclopedias," Philip H. Dougherty, <i>New York Times</i>, June 11, 1967 (p. 170)<br>
[NOTE: This article includes photos of the three ads.]
<p>
<b>3. Book-of-the-Month-Club" special cook book promotions</b><br>
...In 1968/9 the Book-of-the-Month Club promoted five "indispensible cookbooks" for $2.00 a volume. They were:
The New York Times Cook Book/Claiborne, Joy of Cooking/Rombauer & Becker, Mastering the Art of French Cooking/Beck, Berthoolle and
Child, The Spice Cook Book/Stuckey, Day & Spier, Larousse Gastonomique/Mongagne, translated by Turgeon.

<p>
<b>4. Cooking and Crafts Club, "an arm of the Book of the Month Club"</b><bnr>
...In the 1970s, commercial "book clubs" promoting direct sales to consumers flourished. Some major operations expanded sales
by offering topical "clubs" to niched demographics. 
<p>
"Book-of-the-Month Club Inc. marks its 50th anniversary this year and seems likely to celebrate it with record high earnings...There are
over 150 individual book clubs operating in the United States. The company's ability to consistently operate profitably in this 
specialized are of book selling reflects a high degree of expertise in tapping the market of potential new members...The company's
 operations have reflected a flexible approach to the introduction of new clubs and the phasing out of others that are slated
to fade. The roster of special cluns includes Cooking and Crafts Club, purchased from McCall's in 1971 as the Cookbook Club and 
expanded three years later to include crafts."<br>

<i>Barron's National Business and Financial Weekly</i>, March 8, 1976 (p. 61)
<p>
<b>[1971]</b><br>
"Book-of-the-Month-Club...new members...The smaller clubs include the Cookbook Club, acquired last July."<br>
---"Stockholder Meeting Briefs," <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, November 18, 1971 (p. 37)
<p>
<b>[1973]</b><br>
"An invitation for everyonewho lobes to cook: The Cookbook Club, a new service of the Book-of-the-Month Club...What a perfect time to gie yourself
fresh inspiration and a repertoire of exciting new recipes! With this new introductory offer from The Cookbook Club, you can choose up to

<b>[1986]</b><br>
"Cookbook overkill?...Pat Adrian, director of Cooking and Crafts Club, an arm of the Book of the Month Club with more tha 
200,000 members...our members are a mixed bag of adventurous cooks who want help for entertaining."<br>
---"More than More Recipes: Cookbook fantasies of Upscale Life Styles," Bernadette Wheeler, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, December 4, 
1986 (p. Q40)

<b>Competing cookbook clubs</b><br>

<b>[2008:Gourmet]</b><br> 
"In an attempt to help its readers "cut through the clutter" of the 24,000 cookbooks published each year, Gourmet magazine is launching the Gourmet Cookbook 
Club, which will select one book a month. The magazine's editors will choose books that offer "imaginative insight and delicious results." The club's inaugural 
selection is Fish Without a Doubt by Rick Moonen and Roy Finamore, which Houghton Mifflin will publish May 21. Gourmet 's June issue, which goes on sale 
May 20, will announce the selection, and a simultaneous feature will run at Gourmet.com. Selections will be marked with a Gourmet plate-shaped seal to indicate 
they are official selections."<br>

<b>5. Culinary discussion groups focused on cook books as a literary genre.</b><br>
...Hosted by private citizens (cook book authors, recipe bloggers) in homes; cooking central to the meeting.
<p>
"While eating inadvertently becomes the focus of many book clubs, there are also those founded with precisely that in mind. Cookbook clubs tend to function like structured, recurring potlucks. Everyone contributes a dish from a title agreed upon in advance; some members buy the book, others check it out of the library, still others get scanned pages via email from fellow members. Between meetings, groups stay connected through social media as they try out recipes. Among those used to documenting and sharing (in the Facebook sense) most every meal, it's the logical extension of the Internet-enabled foodie zeitgeist -- only with a crucial face-to-face component. 
Through a friend I connected with Steven Wade, 27, a recent graduate of New York University's Food Studies masters program who started a cookbook club last year. "We responded to a need within our group of friends who wanted to cook more, but were unsure how to begin," Mr. Wade said. They agreed to share recipe results on an invite-only Facebook group. 
Prior to the next meeting, focused on "Edible Brooklyn: The Cookbook" (Sterling Epicure, 2011), I logged on to the group's page and found evidence of feverish cooking. "Tried the steamed buns with Chinese sausage," wrote novice cook Chris Fay, under a photo of deflated dough. "A LOT of work, not a lot of payoff." I cooked dinner from the book -- kale salad and clams with chorizo -- and photographed it. Two people "liked" my photos, and the dinner was great. 
The meeting, at the Bronx apartment of member Michael Roberts, was like a college seminar, except with sangria. Mr. Wade suspected, based on his results, that 
the zucchini cake recipe mistakenly called for baking soda instead of baking powder, while Mr. Fay reported he'd gained confidence. "I'm teaching myself how not
 to be scared in the kitchen," he said. Mr. Wade beamed."<br>
