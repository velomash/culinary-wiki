"Hundreds of poor Hebrews, 90 per ceent of them women, waited outside 188 East Broadway yesterday from a early hour to get free
tickets for the matzoths, Passover bread, meat, and groceries which are given away every year by the United Hebrew Communities
Charity. There is no limit to the number of tickets that are distributed, as the office keeps open so long as the funds last. From 
8 o'clock yesterday morning until 8 o'clock last night 50,000 pounds of mazoths were given away...In additon to the matzoths, the
tickets call for a liberal allowance of meat, coal, vegetables and groceries."<br>---"Hebrew Charity Aids Thousands," 
<i>New York Times,</i>, April 10. 1908 p. 8)

<b>[1916]</b><br>
Charities ensure food for 
all at Passover: refugees, Ellis Island, prisons and soldiers "Jews throughout the world have always made it a point of 
honor to care for their poor, specially around the Passover season, seeing to it that none should lack the matzoth and 
Passover foods. Relying on this,
special appeals have been made by Jewish relief and charitable organizations this year, particularly for the homeless 
Jewish refugees in the war-torn lands of Europe and Asia...In preparation for the
Passover, the United Hebrew Community with the co-operation of the Muskel Al Dol Society, has distributed among the poor
 50,000 pounds of matzoth, 5,000 pounds of meat, 300 pounds of tea and 10 barrels of sugar. 
The food will feed 3,000 families. It is estimated the East Side Matzoth Fund has also purchase 3,000 pounds of matzoth 
for the poor. The poor of the Oriental Jewish Colony have been also been 
provided for the Jewish inmates of prisons and correctional institutions in the State by the Jewish Protectory and Aid 
Society. ...The Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society...will celebrate the opening of the 
Passover season tonight with a Seer at its home where 1,200 Jewish immigrants and poor wil be fed, with another Seder on
 Elliz Island, where all of the Jewish immigrants detained there will sit down to table. Rabbi Barnott Siegel will preside 
at the home and ex-Judge Leon Sanders, President of the Society will preside at Ellis Island...Jewish soldiers and 
sailors from the forts and battleships in the vicinity of New York will be provided with a Seder this evening at the Young 
Men's Hebrew Asspciation, Lexington Avenue and Ninety-second Street."<br>---

"Owing to the wheat conservation rules of the United States Food Administration, Albert Kruger, executive director of the 
Maskel-el-Dol, a relief society on the east side, said yesterday that the Jewish population of the country will have its supply of
matzoth for the Passover season reduced by at least 30 per cent...Mr. Kruger asserted that a greater amount of potatoes will be
used to fill in the want created by the reduction of the matzoth suppy...The substantial rise in the price of mutton over that
of last year will also have its effect on the festivities. A large amount of mutton is consumed during the celebration. A year 
ago mutton sold at 6 to 7 cents a pound. This year it costs aobut 11 1/2 cents a pound."<br>---"Matzoth Will Be Scarce," <i>New

"For the first time since the war broke out in 1914 about 100 Orthodox Jews from Russia and other parts of Eastern Europe
detained on Elliz Island were enable to observe the Feast of the Passover last night through arrangements made by the Hebrew
Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society of 229 East Broadway. M. Kley, agent of the society on the isalnd, and his secretary, Miss
Sonia Moonitz had prepared motzoths, Wine, fish, horseradish, bitter herbs and other accompaniments of the seder were served, and ofe of
the rabbis on the island read the Passover ceremony. The fog forced the society's delgation to reamin on the island
over night."<br>---"Passover at Ellis Island," <i>New York Times</i>, April 3, 1920 (p. 3)

thousand cartons were supplied to Jewish families for Passover...The allotment to orthodox Jewish families contained the
usual supply of potatoes and vegetables, and in addition ten pounds of matzoths, two pounds of vegetable fat and five pounds
of matzoth meal."<br>---"Jobless Here Get 40,000 Food Cartons," <i>New York Times</i>, April 4, 1931 (p. 17)

Leah W. Leonard's <i>Jewish Cookery</i> offers extensive notes, recipes & suggested menus for every meal: "Passover Foods. 
During the eight days of Passover meals vary form those of the rest of the year. The same foods are used with these 
exceptions: all leaven is omitted; dried beans and peas, legumes and grains may not be used; baking powder, baking soda 
and yeast are not permitted. The customary flour for baking and cooking is replaced by matzo meal, potato flour and matzo
 meal cake flour (finely ground matzo meal). All other foods may be used in the same manner as at any other time of the 
year...In some families it is customary to limit the menus to fleishig and pareve foods during Passover week in order to 
eliminate a double set of dishes and kitchen utensils used exclusively for Pesach. Various package foods, canned goods and 
sweet meat, as well as dairy products, are available and labeled Korshe Shel Pesach (for Passover use). Wines, whisky and 
carbonate water for Passover are also marked in the same manner. Meats, poultry, fish, fresh fruits and vegetables are 
used extensively for Passover meals. These meals are further enhanced by specially prepared and packaged dried fruits, 
shredded cocoanut, almonds and other nuts. Salad oils as well as vegetable shortening are also available for Passover use. 
Rendered goose fat (schmaltz) has been a favorite shortening for centuries. Schmaltz of goose fat and chicken fat is 
usually prepared and stored for Passover use long in advance of the holiday in modern Jewish homes. The Passover menus are 
only slightly varied because of the above traditional prohibitions. Specimen menus and substitutes are suggested in the 
following pages. However, as in all meal planning, individual nutrition needs, tastes, preferences and prejudices must be
 taken into consideration. With a little ingenuity the kitchen engineer should have no difficulties in serving 
well-balanced, nutritious and attractive meals during Passover."<br>---<i>Jewish Cookery</i>, Leah W. Leonard [Crown Publishers:New York] 1949 (p. 37-38) [NOTE: Instructions for rendering schmaltz appear on p. 42-43.]

Newest products feature trendy frozen foods: "Although commercially packaged foods now figure prominently in  Passover meus,much cooking is preparation for the holiday still is done at home. This year two leding manufacturers of kosher foods are introducing
new recipes, one for a roll leavened only by steam [I. Rokeach & Sons] , another for an easy-to-do fruit fluden [B. Manischewitz Company; both recipes included]...This year the National Jewish Welfare Board, a Government-authorized agency for serving the religious and morale
needs of Jewish veterans' hospitals, is sending to service men at Fort Hood, Tex., 2000 frozen packaged seders. The packages, preapred by Borenstein Caterers of Cedarhurst, L.I., include matzoh ball soup, gefuilte fist, 
roast chicken and dessert. Similar frozen dinners were sent out last year but the shipments were small. The packaged seders are shipped via American Express in special refrigerated containers that are 
replenished with dry ice along the route. On arrival, they will be stored in frozen food lockers until twelve hours before the Seder, when they will be removed and allowed to thaw. On the seder evening, Jewish Welfore Board volunteers will heat the foil-wrapped chicken in an oven and serve the meal...
Welch's Wine Company has produced a special kosher wine that is offered in a decanter-type bottle for Passover. The concern which makes 'Sweet 'N Hearty' grape wine has produced its new version under
traditional orthodox supervision. New this year at the Lichtman bakeries [Parkchester]...are frozen matzoh balls prepared especially for Passover. Packed six to a box for 48 cents, they require defrosting
 for about an hour before they are ready to pop into boiling water. In Barton's candy shops, Passover specialties include chocolate seder eggs ($1 for a box of ten) and nut-flavored Continental chocolate spread (65 cents) that may be used for topooing cakes and frosting
matzohs."<br>---"Food News: Passover Dishes Reviewed," June Owen, <i>New York Times</i>, March 28, 1952 (p. 29)

<b>[1958]</b><br>
Mildred Grosberg Bellin's <i>Jewish Cook Book</i> chronicles changes in commercially available products: "Until a short 
time ago, the preparation of balanced, nutritious, and varied meals during Passover was a task of genuine difficulty. So
 few of the foods which are permitted during Passover were available that the housewife made up her menus of the same
 dishes, served over and over again. These dishes were traditional ones, varied somewhat in each home by family favorites
 and the personal touch of each cook, but basically composed of the same few ingredients. This was so because during 
Passover, many foods, called chamtez, are forbidden. All breads and any other products made with baking powder, baking
 soda, or yeast, or even with regular flour, are not permitted. Any food prepared with utensils which have touched 
ingredients not permitted during Passover may not be used. (Certain utensils may be kashered for Passover use.) Legumes, 
such as peas and beans, are not eaten by Ashkenazi Jews. Milk and its products may not be served unless the production is
 under rabbinical supervision. Most canned goods are not considered kosher for Passover unless they carry a special seal 
of approval to indicate they were prepared under proper conditions and rabbinical supervision. Also, in former years, 
during the early spring few fresh vegetables and fruits were available. Until recently, all these foods were eliminated
 during Passover. Today this has changed, and so many foods are being prepared especially for this holiday that the choice 
is limited only by the budget. Canned fruits, a variety of spices, pudding mixes, mayonnaise, chocolate, macaroons, cakes, 
cheese of many types, dried fruits, coffee, and tea are among those easily secured. In addition the markets are filled
 with all sorts of fresh fruits and vegetables. Milk can be secured in most communities. Eggs are permitted and abundant. 
With a plentiful supply of meat and fresh fish added, the menu for the entire holiday could be planned with only the 
absence of bread to indicate that it was Passover. However, since much of the spirit of the festival would be lost without 
traditional dishes, these should by all means be included, and combined with others in such a way as to make Passover
 meals distinctive, yet well-balanced. The recipes given in this chapter are those specifically related to Passover, 
either through the use of special Passover ingredients, or through tradition. Any other recipes which do not require 
prohibited ingredients may also be used."---<i>Jewish Cook Book</i>, Mildred Grosberg Bellin [Tudor Publishing 
Company:New York] new and revised edition 1958 (p. 391) <p>

<b>[1969]</b><br>
"How many times have you heard, 'Passover isn't kept the way it's supposed to be anymore,' or 'If this continues, we'll be buying 
everything for {esach'? Of coruse neither of these statements is vald but perhaps an explanation is in order. In the shtetlach (small towns)
 of Europe and in the many ghettos of the world where Jews were segregatd during the almost two-thousand-year Diaspora, keeping a
kosher home was an exercise in self-discipline and devotion. To keep the food regulations of Passover in these alien surroundings
has been even more difficult. The byword has always been, 'When in doubt, don't use it.' Thus, until very recent times the 
observant homemaker was forced to forgo many foods that might have brightened her menus. To make sure that no food contained
chometz, she limited her selection to simple basic foods, the origin of which were beyond doubt...Today it is possible to have
Rabbinical supervision over many Passover foods. The homemaker can choose from a resplendent variety of products providing not
only traditional dishes like ready-to-serve gefilte fish, borscht, soups, and matzos, but also and array of cake mixes, prepared
cakes and cookies, pareve margarine, catsup, mayonnaise, cranberry sauce, potato-pancake mix, pickles, processed herring products,
canned fish like salmon and tuna, ice cream and sherbet, candies, potato chips, and many others...So do not let yourself be shaken
and doubtful...Pasover is not a sacrifice--it is a celebration. And the meals served should reflect the festive mood. Take 
advantage of the food variety at your disposal, use imagination in planning menus, and follow the same rules of good nutrition
that apply during the rest of the year. Never serve the same food more than once in a meal. If you plan tomato juice as an 
appetizer, do not use tomato sauce on the meat. A well-constructed meal should have a variety in texture, flavor, color, and 
temperature. A meal in which everything is baked, or broiled, or boiled, or fried is dull and uninteresting."<br>---

B. Manischewitz Company) [Walker and Company:New York] 1969 (p. 24-25)[NOTE: This 186 page book offers dozens of suggested
menus for all meals (Seder, lunch, dinner, breakfast) accompanied by recipes. The company subsequently offered free Passover 
Recipe Guides containing some of these items.]

<b>[1970]</b><br>
Gourmet twist on traditional fare: "Passover, with all its dietary restrictions, poses a challenge to many Jewish homemakers. Mrs. [Bessie] Feffer 
has developed several recipes ovr the years for dishes that are different but still kosher. Her first seder meal witll include gefilte fish,
chicken soup with marrow-bone matzoh balls, potted cornish hens with shallots and white wine, asparagus, beets in 
lemon sauce with slivered almonds and a seven-layer chocolate cake...For the second Seder, Mrs. Feffer is planning a menu of salmon with lemon sauce, borsct,
meat-stuffed veal, new potatoes, string beans, mixed salad and baked apples with apricot glaze. A special spinach and 
cheese dish will probably be on the luncheon menu several times during Passover."<br>---"Seder Menu: Traditional but
