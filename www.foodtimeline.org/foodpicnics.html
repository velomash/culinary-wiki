<b>What is a picnic?</b><br>
Food historians tell us picnics evolved from the elaborate traditions of moveable outdoor feasts
enjoyed by the wealthy.  Medieval hunting feasts, Renaissance-era country banquets, and
Victorian garden parties lay the foundation for today's leisurely repast.  Picnics, as we Americans
know them today, date to the middle of the 19th century. Although the "grand picnic" is generally
considered a European concept, culinary evidence confirms people from other parts of the world
engage in similar practices.
<p>
"Picnic. Originally, A fashionable social entertainment in which each person present contributed
a share of the provisions; now, A pleasure party including an excursion to some spot in the country
where all partake of a repast out of doors: the participants may bring with them individually the
viands and means of entertainment, or the whole may be provided by some one who 'gives the
picnic'. "<br>
---<i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> [Clarendon Press:Oxford], 2nd edition, Volume XI (p.
779)<br>
[NOTESS: (1)The <i>OED</i> traces the oldest print evidence of the word picnic in the English
language to 1748. The word was known in France, Germany, and Sweden prior to becoming an
English institution. (2) Meals where participants contribute food are also sometimes called 
<a href="foodfaq7.html#potluck">pot luck</a>.]
<p>
"The earliest picnics in England were medieval hunting feasts. Hunting conventions were
established in the 14th century, and the feast before the chase assumed a special importance.
Gaston de Foiz, in a work entitled <i>Le Livre de chasse</i> (1387), gives a detailed description
of such an event in France. As social habits in 14th century England were similar to those in
medieval France, it is safe to assume that picnics were more or less the same. Foods consumed
would have been pastries, hams, baked meats, and so on...Picnicking really come into its own
during the Victorian era, and enters into the literature of that period. Dickens, Trollope, Jane
Austen all found pleasure in introducing this form of social event into their fiction. One can see
why: a rustic idyll furnished an ideal way of presenting characters in a relaxed environment, and
also provided an opportunity to describe a particularly pleasant rural spot. Painters have also
been
drawn to the subject...Monet, Renoir, Cezanne..."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999
(p. 602)<br> [NOTE: This passage sites several sources for further study, including one for Japanese
picnic customs.]
<p>
"The French might have invented the word "picnic," pique nique being found earlier than "pic
nic." (The meaning, aside from the probably connotation of "picking," is unknown.) It originally
referred to a dinner, usually eaten indoors, to which everyone present had contributed some food,
and possible also a fee to attend. The ancient Greek "eranos," the French "moungetade" described
earlier, or modern "pot luck" suppers are versions of this type of mealtime organization. The
change in the meaning of the term, from "everyone bringing some food" to "everyone eating out
of doors" seems to have been completed by the 1860s. The impromptu aspect, together with the
informality, are what the new meaning has in common with the old; there is a connotation too of
simple food, which may be quite various, but which is not controlled, decorated, or strictly
ordered into courses. Picnics derive, also, from the decorous yet comparatively informal
sixteenth-century "banquets" mentioned earlier, which frequently took place out of doors...Not
very long ago, picnics were rather formal affairs to our way of thinking, with tables, chairs, and
even servants. But everything is relative: what was formal then made a trestle-table in the open
countryside seem exhiliaratingly abandoned. The general feeling of relief from normal
constraints..."<br>
---<i>The Rituals of Dinner: The Origins, Evolutions, Eccentricities and Meaning of Table
Manners</i>, Margaret Visser [Penguin:New York] 1991 (p. 150-1)
<p>
"Picnic.  An informal meal in which everyone pays his share or brings his own dish,' according to
the Littre dictionary. That was probably the original meaning of the word, which is probably of
French origin (the French piquer means to pick at food; nique means something small of no
value.) The word was accepted by the Academie francaise in 1740 and thereafter became a
universally accepted word in many languages. From the informal picnic, the outdoor feast
developed. In Victorian Britain picnics may not have been as formal as country-house dinners,
but
they were often elaborate affairs. Weekend shooting parties and sporting events were occasions
for grand picnics, with extensive menus and elaborate presentation."<br>

<b>What is an American picnic?</b><br>
A celebration of human spirit, culinary diversity, and adventure. Picnics are personal. We choose
the foods we serve, our dining partners, and the venue. Planned or impromptu, they are very
different from public outdoor dining events: community feasts (New England clambakes, Texas
barbecues, New Orleans shrimp boils), al-fresco dining (trendy waterfront bistros, central city
cafes), and fair food.  
<p>
What do we eat? That depends upon who we are. As true with most holiday meals, family
favorites reign supreme. Impromptu picnics are meals of happenstance. Thus defined: a
American
picnic can be: <ul>
<li>"traditional American foods" prepared at home and served on a blanket in a local park
<li> ethnic cuisine celebrated by an extended family in an urban riverfront location
<li> an artfully presented basket of gourmet delights served on fine linen and china
<li> box lunch obtained from a convenience store consumed at the beach
<li> bread, cheese, and grapes shared by best friends in a canoe
<li> a family passing peanut butter crackers and bottled water at a highway rest stop
<li> a child serving imaginary cakes to stuffed animals beneath the protective branches of the
family's backyard tree. 
</ul>
It's the spirit, not the food, that makes this meal special.
<p>
Suggested outdoor menus printed in cookbooks and magazines  are good markers for period
preference but cannot possibly convey the full depth of true American picnic fare. People living
in
the same place and period may set very different picnic tables. To wit? Newly emigrated peoples
historically dine on old world favorites while wealthy folks fuss over professionally prepared
hampers. The fine line between traditional picnic (fully-prepared transported meals) and outdoor
cooking (grill-ready foods) is often obscured. Many outdoor meals combine the best of both
traditions.
<p>
<b>Observations on "old fashioned picnics" c. 1912:</b><br>
"'It may be a sacrilege,' spoke up the youngish man with the fuzzy hat, 'to associate Decoration Day
with anything outsied of the heroes who fought, bled, and died for their country's cause, but do you know what I
always think of in connection with the approach of Decoration Day? Picnics! Yep, picnics come to my mind whith thoughts
of Memorial Day just as I see stockings hanging by the fireplace at the mention of Christmas. When I was a youngster we went on 
a picnic every May 30, regardless of anything short of a cloudburst. It was the first holiday that came along after
picnics got ripe enough to pick each Spring, and we invariably went forth on that day to eat things off a tablecloth spread
on the ground. Say, do you think the American picnic is what it used to be? I have often thought that trolley cars would eventually
make the modern picnic such a sorry variation of the old-fashioned style that yound people will get so they don't care whether
they're going to a picnic or to a moving picture show. Who ever heard of going to a picnic in a trolley car when you and I were kids?
In those days they have picnic wagons with seats running along the sides. There was some class to them. Mebby you knew them as
carryalls, but we called them picnic wagons, and that's what they were. They were built to accomodate about twenty people besides
the driver, and there was space on the driver's seat for the young man who lost out with his girl in the course of the day and 
desired to be away from the light-hearted crowd on the drive home while he planned out his future. It's been some fifteen years or
so since I was to one of those old-fashioned picnics in a picnic wagon with a bunch of young men in duck trousers and young
women in their jaunty little shirtwaist outfits...The first step after we had made up a crowd of congenial spirits was for two 
or three of us to adjourn to a livery stable where we would endeavor to reach an agreement with the man who owned the picnic
wagon as to how much his outfit meant to him for one day. My memory is a little hazy, but it seems to me that we usually got out for 
somewhere around one iron man apiece. There was no further expense because, according to tradition, all eatables were provided
by the feminine portion of the party. We weren't hard to please. A few cold fried chickens, some peanut sandwiches, a big paper sack
full of Saratoga chips, some potato salad in a fruit jar, two or three kinds of jelly and bread and butter, a couple of chocolate cakes
and a cocoanut cake and a freeze of strawberry ice cream and a few accessories were practically all we expected at a picnic dinner in those
days...It was customary for people who went on picnics to go a certain spot where there was a small river the size of a creek,,
with some right respectable-sized cliffs on both sides. The advantages of this place were that it was twelve miles away, which meeant
a long drive home by moonlight or starlight as the case might be--it didn't matter much--and there were a lot of rocks in the creek
where the girls could cross over to the other side to make anybody desire to be there...One of the great problems in making
arrangements for a picnic was the selection of a chaperon. We usually succeeded in getting hold of somebody only about four or
five years older than ourselves, and then one of the boys would fix it with an older brother to go along and look after her and
keep her mind occupied...The day after the picnic the local paper would write it up, and close by saying that 'a delightful time
was had'--and that was the truth."<br>

"Picnics</b><br>
If the party is to drive or ride, let not the distance be too great. There should be a stream or spring of pure water, materials
for a fire, shade intermingled with sunshine, and a resonable freedom from tormenting insect life. Charming as is the prospect of
picnicing in some grand dell, some some lofty peak, or in some famous cave or legendary ruin, there are also other considerations 
which whould not be fortotten. One does not feel too comfortable when banqueting in localities where Dame Nature has had her queer
moods, and has left imprinted certain too observable evidences of her freakiness. Such places may be included within the 
excursion itself, but let the feast and the frolic take place where weird effects are not the prevailing characteristic of the
locality.
<p>
"Be careful to dress for the entertainment, after consulting the barometer and the thermometer, and after learning the geography of
the objective point of the day. A woolen dress that is not too heavy nor yet too new, or a cotton one that is not too think, whith short, trim skirts,
solid, easy shoes, that have a friendliness for the feet because of prolonged intimacy with them; pretty, but not too fine or thin
stockings; a hat that has a broad brim; a large sun-shade or a sun-umbrella; at least two fresh handkerchiefs; some rings, and needle and thread
stowed away in ones portemonnaie or chatelaine-pocket; easy gloves, with ample wrists; a jacket to wear when returning home;
and a rug or traveling-shawl to spread upon the ground at dinner time, are among the requisites of personal comfort and
prettiness.
<p>
"Two or three hammocks, providing the picnic be in a forest; a few closely-folding camp-chairs, and a spirit-lamp or two for extra
tea or coffee, are comforts that require no space worth considering, and only a little remembrance when packing up, while they
really increase to a large degree the agreeable flavor of a day in the woods. Don't forget two or three books that have brief, 
bright poems or narratives in them, for inactive or half-dreamy members of the party, upon whom the spirit of romance and
rhythm is sure to fall after dining, provided they do not drop asleep entirely. When providing food for the party, pray do not
forget to supply at least double the quantity which would be served at home for the same number of people, and then be sure to add
a little more. To be hungry, ravenously hungry, while in the woods, proves to us that fresh air is wholesome and that nature 
encourages vigorous appetites. Therefore, even if they were convenient of transport, soups would not be a necessary stimulant to
digestion.<p>
"Of fish, cold boiled salmon, upon which a mayonnaise may be served at pleasure from a wide-mouthed bottle; or sardines, accompanied by
sardine-scissors, are the easiest to manage, and althogether the most satisvactory--but don't forget their intimate friends, the
lemonds. About meats, there are many varieities that may bes ered in the woods, but they should always be sude as can be 
arranged for finger, rather than fork eating. Nature did not make forks, as is frequently asserted; and, therefore, a picnic
is just that agreeable sort of free and easy entertainment that is the most charming to people who are already wearied with pomps and 
forms, ceremonies and things generally spectacular, and who fleeto the woods in print dresses and plain uniforms, in order to
escape such exactions for a little while. In fact, they long to eat food by the aid of their fingers. Tiny lamb or veal chops, 
closely and carefully trimmed, dipped in egg and then in crmbs and delicately browned, after which their stems are ruffled with
paper are delicious when cold, and are easy to manage. Chickens, cut up after roasting or broiling, are excellent and appropriate, 
but they are not so dainty nor so convenient to handle as the papered chops.
<p>
"The best and most convenient of all out-of-door edibles, is the sandwich. Not the one with slips of meat laid between slices of buttered
bread, so that when a bit of bread is taken, all the enclosed meat is dragged out, unless a serious contest takes place in its
behalf between the teeth and fingers, which, to confess the truth, is not an attractive conflict...To make sandwich that leave none but
pleasant memories and provoke no temper while in transit from the basket to the gastric regions, always grind the meat or chop it whne cold to
very nearly a pulp. Make a thick mayonnaise, and mix it with the meat until it is about the consistency of marmalade. Store and
carry this most agreeable preparation in a covered dish or close jar. If it be rich with good oil, no butter is needed. Sometiems, however, butter is
beaten in with the meat before it is married to the mayonnaise, which gives to the sandwich a delicious flavor. Carry along with the meat biscuits
or uncut loaves of good bread, with sharp knives to slcie them evenly and thinly; and don't fail to remember what intensity
the appetite may posses by mid-day, nor yet that, when it is appeased at that hour, it frequently renews its strength and comes back again about
4 o'clock in the afternoon and is as exacting as if it had not been appeased for a whole week. These best-of-all sandwiches are made ready when they
are wanted. They are thus preserved from that taste of staleness that comes over them when they have been made a journey after the
meat was joined to the bread. Cold tongue, cold roast veal, cold roast beef and cold ham are all of them excellent for sandwiches, 
but the flavoring of salt, mustard, etc., is varied to suit the peculiar qualities of each. Tongue and ham possess decided qualities
of their own, but the other two meats require toning-up to suit the palate. Grated pine-apple-cheese, mixed with a thick 
mayonnaise and placed between very thinly cut slices of bread, is very much liked by gentlemen. Olives, pickles and jellies are
easily carried, and prove agreable additions.
<p>
"For desserts, there are many things, but beware of articles that will not bear traveling without lookng dejected and sullen. 
Candied fruits with macaroons, sponge or pound cakes, are about the most agreeable of all the sweets which are adapted to 
journeys. Small sugared fruits may be purchased of the confectioner, but grapes, currants and oranges are easily prepared at home...
Fresh fruits are also agreeable at an out-door feast, without coating them with sugar. For drinking, tea that has been made, 
seasoned while hot and then bottled directly, is delicious; so, also, is coffee; but both these liquids may be made fresh by
the fire if one is made in gypsy fashion. For lemonade roll the fruit in granulated sugar that is spread upon a marble or other hard
survace, then squeeze them over the sugar and remove their seeds; the juice, thus obtained, may be bottled for the journey and added to water at
pleasure. If ice must be carrried, select, a clear solid piece, and wrap it in a heavy flannel. Carry an ice-pick with it, so that it may be 
broken up when needed, with a little waste as possible. One really requires no wine at an al-fresco feast, even if
accustomed to use it at a home dinner. The exhilaration of the air is quite sufficient for the needs of digestion. If wine must
be carried, claret is vest, because it is never served with ice, the most fastidious of wine-tasters insisting that its flavor is
injured if it is not drank while of the same temperature as the atmosphere.
<p>
"For the feast, forget not the napkins, forks, spoons and the luncheon-cloth. Also carry tumblers, plates, salt, pepper, sugar and a bottle
of cream or can of condensed milk. Cups with handles, but no saucers, are desirable for tea and coffee...The following bill of are may be selected
from, with such changes as suit the locality or general surroundings. <b>Bill of fare for a spring picnic</b>. Cold Roast
Chicken. Sandwiches of Potted Rabbit. Bewitched Veal. Small Rolls with Salad Filling. Cold Baked Ham. Egg Salad. Buttered

"Suggestions for School, Picnic, or Travelling Lunches.</b><br>
In boxes, or pretty baskets of suitable size and light weight, may be found in our stores; some of them fitted with compartments and
receptacles for the various articles which are usually prepared for such occasions...For a travelling or picnic party of any large
number, and particularly if there is to be some conveyance to and from the place  for luncheon, it might be advisable to provide
one's self with a hamper elegantly fitted with every needful or imaginary article. They are marvels of convenience and help greatly in 
keeping everything separate and in perfect condition and really tempt the appetite. Their cost is generally equal to their convenience,,
but for those whose purses will not permit such a luxury, a steamer cooker with its various compartments will be found a fair
rival, as far as convenience goes. For the traveller on a short journey, and where dining cars are not to be found or patronized,
there is nothing better than a paper box and some bottles or jars of convenient size, which may be left when their usefulness is
ended, in some waste bin by the way. There will be but few ounces of extra or useless weight, which is not the case with the
imported hampers. These often weigh, when empty, more than some persons could well carry. The following menus will show the great 
variety one may arrange for either of the occasions when such meals are needed:<br>
No. 1. Spiced beef sliced, rye muffins, cup custard, bananas.<br>
No. 2. Roast beef or cold steak sandwiches, canned fruit, hermits.<br>
No. 3. Stuffed eggs, buttered rolls, oranges.<br>
No. 4. Chicken sandwiches, tiny rice puddings, peaches, milk.<br>
No. 5. Cheese sandwiches, gingerbread, prunes.<br>
No. 7. Fishballs, Graham bread and butter, prune whip, lemonade.<br>
No. 8. Baked bean sandwiches, potato salad, apples, gingersnaps.<br>
No. 9. Jelly or jam sandwiches, sliced ham, little plain cakes, milk.<br>
No. 10. Lettuce sandwiches, stem strawberries with sugar, cream cheese balls, cookies.<br>
Formerly such lunches were confined to sandwiches, cakes, etc., with perhpas a bottle of cold coffee or lemonade; but as cakes and rich
sweets are often the things least to be desired, it is wise to provide some receptacle in which a greater variety of foods may
be carried. Small fruit jars, with glass covers and rubbers, which may be tightly sealed,--tiny tumblers for a small portion of
stewed fruit, or soft pudding, tiny custards, puddings and timbales, meat or fish, salads and many other foods, will all find
a place in the luchh box prepared by one who is willing to give some thought and time to this duty. Waxed paper is almost a
necessity, if things are to be kept separate and in attractive condition. Plates made of wood as thin as pasteboard are cheap
and especially convenient for picnics and travellers, where no table is procurable; and a cheap knife, fork and spoon add little to
the weight, but much to one's comfort."<br>

<p>
<b>[1908]</b><br>
"Picnic menus. Many a housewife who finds no trouble in devising dainty and attractive menus
for
the home table declares herself feazed when it comes to the preparation of the picnic basket. Yet
it is not a difficult undertaking when one gets on to the "pull of the ropes." Even in the home
meals there must be forethought to see that all necessary materials are on hand. Even more so is
this essential in putting up luncheon for half the pleasure of a picnic depends on the efficiency of
its commissary department, and any serious oversight when one is twenty miles from a lemon or
any other desired edible is a misfortune hard to bear. Picnic luncheons should vary according to
the prospective stage setting and the mode of journey thither. If the party is to motor, sail or drive
to its destination, with pleny of room for hampers and accessories, the bill of fare may be much
more varied and comprehensive than when one goes on trolley or wheel or expects to tramp to
the picnic ground. In the latter case it is necessary to go in light marching order, everything as
compact as possible, and things must be stowed away in boxes instead of baskets, that may be
thrown away when the meal is finished. Individual drinking cups should be included in every
luncheon outfit, and the new paper collapsible cups that now come for three or four cents apiece
solve the question that was erstwhile a perplexing one. Paper napkins and table cloths, a whole
set
of the latter consisting of fancy cloth 42X56 and a dozen napkins to match, put up in stout
envelope cases, may be bought at ten cents for a set.
<p>
    "Picnic sandwiches. It goes without saying that sandwiches are the backbone of all
out-of-door luncheons, and the roster of delightful ones is long. The "binding" may be a light
tender
wheat bread, at least twenty-four hours old and cut wafer thin; may be brown bread or whole
wheat bread cut thicker; may be a two story affair, with both white and brown bread in amicable
relations; may be substantial slices of rye or pumpernickel, a tender baking powder biscuit, a
fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth roll, or conbread or gems that are not too crumbly. The filling must
accord with its binding and its name is legion. With the dainty slices of wheat bread comes first a
spreading of sweet butter applied with a light hand. Then comes a the heart of the sandwich,
which may be caviar mixed with a little lemon juice, anchovies pounded to a paste and mixed
with
equal quantities stoned and chopped olives and a sprinkling of minced parsely, a slice of chicken
breast salted and prepared with a protecting leaf of crispy lettuce moistened with mayonnaise,
nasturtium leaves, blossoms and stems lightly salted, sprigs of watercress seasoned, minced
chicken moistened with own stock, gravy or mayonnaise, equal quantities chopped chicken and
ham, with a few minced truffles thrown in a mince of ham and veal in combination, of tongue
and
veal, wafer thin slices of boiled tongue, or tongue in aspic cut in delicate slices and laid with
equally thin slices of tomato salad and peppered between rounds of buttered bread.
<p>
    "Tasty additions to the luncheon. Tasty additions to the luncheon are a souse of pigs' feet, veal
loaf, broiled chicken, smoked salmon sliced thin, boned herring, baked beans, chicken salad, put
up in little individual paper cases, then packed in a large box and carried "right side up with
care."
Swiss cheese sliced thin never goes begging. Saratoga chips are tasty and easy to carry and serve.
A pigeon pie is extrememly English and extremely nice, as also lamb cutlets in aspic jelly.
<p>
    "Relishes for the picnic basket. Among the tasty relishes for the picnic basket are olives
(opening the bottle and pouring off the liquor before packing), pickles, salted peanuts, radishes
(not forgetting to put in the salt shaker), popcorn, young onions for those who are especially fond
of them and tomatoes.
<p>
   "Sweets for topping off. Among the sweets best for topping off the luncheon are currant tarts,
carrying shells and jelly separately and putting together before service; apple or berry tunovers, a
glass of bar-le-duc or other jelly, chocolate and sponge cake, cookies and crullers, preserved
ginger, crystallized fruits, and if there is to be a camp fire plenty of marshmallows for toasting.
<p>
    "Liquids. As a large amount of liquid is awkward to carry it is usually better to take a small
bottle of something concentrated that may be diluted with cold water when ready to serve the
lunch. The juice of lemons may be squeezed out and made as sweet as desired; then bottled.
Raspberry of cherry shrub is refreshing, allowing a couple of tablespoonfuls to each glass of cold
water. Team may be made quite strong, so as to bear reducing, carrying along lemons and block
sugar to be added when serving. Grape juice is always appreciated. Ginger beer has its adherents,
and a couple of bottles of claret add cheer and refreshment. If coffee is carried, it is better
sweetened and "creamed" before starting, then poured into bottles with patent stoppers.

"Picnic and Travelling Lunches</b><br>
 Collect boxes of different sizes as you have opportunity. Save waxed paper from cracker boxes and other sources and have a certain place for it so as to know 
just where to find it. Quite a large roll can be bought in the stationery stores for five cents. Keep small tin boxes for packing strong flavored sandwiches, and 
vaseline bottles and cold cream jars for salad dressings, or for sandwich fillings which must be spread upon the bread the last thing. For a picnic or a long journey, 
be sure to take everything that may be needed, corkscrew, can opener, nut picks, paring knives, spoons, a case knife, a knife large enough and sharp enough to cut 
bread, cups for drinking, and a small saucepan or large cup for heating drinks or anything necessary. As far as possible, carry dishes that may be thrown away, as 
wood or paper plates and cups. A spirit lamp is very desirable. Rich cakes, jellies and all sweets are especially objectionable for travelling. Be sure to take plenty 
of lemons and other fruits, as the trains will not often stop long enough for one to buy them at the stations, and they may not be at the proper stage of ripeness and
 the price will be high. Carry salt in a vaseline bottle, or if in a salt shake, screw a piece of thick paper under the top and wrap well. Have sugar in a wide-mouthed
 bottle or jar, also ripe olives. Rice or custard puddings can be carried in cups. Bottled fruit juices are invaluable. Lemon juice sufficient for one day may be
 bottled. A jar of cold cereal coffee or of tea-hygiene with cream would be highly prized by many. Trumese in Tomato or Sauce Imperial, well dried in the oven, is
 excellent. Fruit buns retain their moisture nicely. Wrap sandwiches, buns, cakes, eggs and nut foods in waxed paper, and if there are different kinds of sandwiches
 mark them. For a simple luncheon without a knife or spoon, pare oranges and break them into sections, and pare, quarter and core apples, and wrap all in waxed 
paper. These fruits with a trumese and egg sandwich (p. 472) make an ideal midday luncheon when spending the day in the city on business. One lady who has 
travelled a great deal tells me that she has found a small white apron with a pocket a great convenience in serving and eating lunches on trains, and a gentleman
 suggests that a short apron with a bib and strap and a pocket for the napkin would be a great convenience for those of his sex. Some of the strong pasteboard 
boxes that package foods come in, make good lunch boxes. We have one about 22 in. long, 9 in. wide and 6 in. deep that we can carry in a shawl strap, which we
 prize. The dining car has no attractions campared with the comforts of a nice home luncheon for travelling."<br>

"Outdoor meals.</b> From time immemorial the outdoor meal has been a real fete; probably because
in the earlier days there were not so many large buildings as now, so when groups were to get
together it was necessarily to occupy the out-of-doors. It was undoubtedly because of this that
barbecues became so popular, and because a real outdoor fete is nowadays a rarity, that they are
so popular...There is no reason why the outdoor meal should not become a habit with everyone
except in very stormy weather; children should be encouraged to take their luncheons outdoors
on
Saturdays. There is nothing so wonderful as the adventures of playing "camping out" in the
spring, summer, or late fall...During the warm weather the family can frequently eat outdoors, on
the piazza, roof, in the backyards, or in a near-by park. A delightful way for a city woman to
entertain her city friends in the summer is by means of a picnic lunch in the park, because it is a
novelty, and because, after all, everyone loves the out-of-doors."

"The Meal Out-Of-Doors</b><br>
We have left the discussion of camp cookery to the books on that subject. Here we shall be concerned only with the meal that is prepared
indoors and eaten outdoors--on the porch or at a distant picnic spot. The most important point to remember in planning for this type
of meal is that the same principles of good menu combinations hold indoors and out. The 'iron rations' of the traditional picnic, 
with their aftermath of adult discomfort and juvenile outbursts of temper, may have been inevitable before the invention of the 
automobile and the vacuum food container, but they are not easily justified today. It is a simple matter to prepare, transport,
and serve as normal a meal as the family is accustomed to around the home dinner table. Nevertheless there are a few
limitations in the choice of foods for the meal to be served out-of-doors. We are listing these considerations which seem most
important to us: (1) The foods must retain a palatable temperature with the faciltiies available. Vacuum bottles will take care of 
bevereages; a wide-mouth vacuumn container will keep salad ingredients refreshingly cool and crisp. Foods in baking dishes taken
from the oven keep hot for a surprisingly long time. (2) The foods should withstand rough handling in transportration. Although 
pies and cakes may be carried safely in the pans in which they were baked, a meringue or fluffy frosting is always a 
hazard. (3) The foods should lend themselves to the simplest form of service. For the meal at a distance from home, not more than one
plate per serving should be required. Paper plates divided into compartments help the component parts of the meal to retain their
identity, Demands on cultery should be reduced to a minimum. The following out-of-door menu includes combinations which might be served
equally well at home: Cold Sliced Beef of Lamb, Potatoes au Gratin, Sliced Tomatoes, Cucumber Strips, Bread and Butter 
Sandwiches, Fresh Pineapple Wedges with Powdered Sugar, Sponge Cake, Coffee, Milk."<br>

<b>[1940] Picnic Lunches or Suppers</b><br>
"The question what to eat at a picnic meal depends entirely on where the picnic is to be given.
Should it be on the beach, a fire adds to the charm of the occasion: Steaks or chops can be
broiled
or eggs and bacon can be cooked in a frying-pan. Morever, all trash can be burned up afterwards,
as one of the first lessons a good picnicker learns it to leave no trace of his visit behind him. On
the other hand, if the picnic is to be given in the woods, a large fire is extremely dangerous.
Therefore all the hot food should be carried in Thermos bottles and jars.

sandwiches, a refreshing salad in covered watertight cartons, a tasty hot creamed dish, baked
beans, or soup in a vacuum jug, plenty of fruit, cake or cookies, and coffee and milk in vacuum

make
his or her own sandwiches. However, if men were given a choice, most of them would probably
vote for the picnic where they can cook at least one dish over the open fire. Folding portable

which burn charcoal of briquets can be purchased for a reasonable sum. These work easily and
efficently not only on picnics and motor trips where you camp out, but in the living room
fireplace
as well. More and more too, we find brick and stone fireplaces being built in backyards of homes,
with the result that grill suppers in which the host presides over the cooking of the meat, while
the
hostess takes charge of the rest of the meal indoors, are much in vogue. The complete meal is
served either buffet or sit-down stype from a table set up on the lawn.<p>

<b>[1954] "Picnics, Clambakes & Big-party dishes</b><br>
I was brought up in a household famous for its fabulous cooking, and the memories of my
childhood are full of one fine meal after another. But the most exciting of all were the
magnificent
family picnics. Huge hampers and baskets were filled with an endless array of delectable tidbits
to
be consumed in the great outdoors--on a wide sandy beach by the Pacific, or high in the
mountains where blue and red huckleberries grew in abundance, or along some winding road
deep
in a canyon beside a rushing stream. For the cold food and drink, we stopped at an ice-house and
picked up a large cake of ice which sat on the floor in the back of the car with the perishables on
top. If we wanted anything hot, and we usually planned on coffee at least, we'd build up a fire in
the open or if we were near woods that might catch from fire, we'd manage with a little alcohol
stove...Today's picnicker has no such problems. He can take along a small portable cooking grill
that is easy to set up and use. The Skotch Grill...serves as a container to carry its own
charcoal...or some of your picnic supplies....Then there is the old reliable portable gasoline stove,
the Coleman, which has served campers and outdoor enthusiasts for years. For heating coffee or
soup, a little folding Sterno stove can be used wherever you stop. And if you're heading for one
of the wayside picnic groves that are found along many of our great highways, you can usually
find an outdoors fireplace...Carrying hot or cold food and drink is a simple matter today. There
are small portable ice boxes which will hold about 12 pounds of ice, and large Thermos jugs for
hot or cold food or drink. Or you can use one of the handy Skotch Koolers packed with ice cubes
and your food and it will keep cold for hours...If you use paper plates and cups for serving, be
sure they're the kind that don't get soggy. Plastic dishes are much more serviceable, though of
course not so easily disposable. If you do any amount of picnicking, it will be worth your while
to
invest in one of those wonderful picnic baskets that are equipped with a Thermos bottle or two,
plastic dishes, stainless steel cutlery, and salt and pepper shakers, all held in place and with room
left for sandwiches and other supplies. You might also look into the many sets of portable
cooking equipment designed for campers and for the use of the armed forces, available
respectively at sporting-good stores and war-surplus dealers...In planning your picnic meals,
you'll do well to plan a simple menu of hearty grub that will satisfy appetites sharpened by fresh
air and the tang of woodsmoke. Stick to three or four items, have them of the best quality, and
serve plenty of  em...One classic dish for a picnic is fried chicken, cooked beforehand and
reheated or eaten cold. It has a superb flavor and goes wonderfully well with the other traditional
picnic foods: stuffed eggs, potato salad, baked beans and chocolate cake."<br>

"Outdoor Meals</b><br>
If you like outdoor meals, you begin the picnic season as soon as weather permits and carry on through the cool, crisp days
of fall. The simplest type of picnic meal calls for the making of a varity of hearty sandwiches and hard-cooked or devlied eggs
which, accompanied by a thermos bottle of coffee and bottles of milk, needs only fruit or cookies for dessert. The children will be
satisfied with a meal of this type just so they can eat it outdoors. For a more elaborate picnic, cold fried chicken may be
served. There are many picnic kits obtainable on the market, containing silver, cups and plates, salt and pepper shakers, and 
vacuum jugs. The latter will keep food hot or cold for some time. The men of the household, generally prefer a cooked meal and will
gladly do their part in making the fire and superintending the cooking of hamburgers, hot dogs, ham, or steak. A charcoal stove
which can be purchased for a small amount of money is a good investment as in this case you are independent as far as fuel is
concerned and anyone can get a bed of glowing coals in a short time. A folding stove with a bag of charcoal or briquets can be 
kept in the luggage compartment of the car ready for use...

"Picnics and Trips</b><br>
Watteau's paintings of the French court at play establish very nicely, I think the air of carefree elegance that produces a
memorable picnic. Every outing, however small, would have one or two luxurious touches, an echo of the formal dining room in a 
pastoral setting. Among the warm memories of my childhood are the beach breakfasts and picnic suppers we used to have in the 
West. Some were small fmaily outings, but the memorable ones were the great repasts for 20 or more. The ladies brought salads, or 
desserts, or cuts of meat to be cooked. The men toted the hampers and buckets and camp chairs; they gathered the wood and built and tended
the fire. Somehow my mother was always the cook--probably because she was acknowledged to be a great one. Her outdoor pancakes, with ham and
sausage, were notable. Her clam fritters superb. Her hamburgers--I'm sure she used a half-pound of meat in each one-were pan-broiled to ]
perfection in a huge iron skillet over the hot embers of a driftwood fire. The salt breeze freshened the appetite--or the coll pine
forest half off the midday sun--or the scent of summer lay on the meadows, and in all these places and times the food and drink 
was beyond compare. Today, of coruse, the same opportunities offer, although it may be harder to discover the private, untouched glade or
stretch of beach than it used to be. The picnic may be a romatic dejuener sur l'herbe for two, or a gathering of the clan; it may be simple as a sandwich
in wax paper, or as elaborate as appetite, inclination, and purse will allow. In the Edwardian era, at the turn of the century, the
landed gentry thought nothing of sending servants on ahead to the picnic site to establish an outdoor drawing room. By the time the picnickers
arrived, rugs had been spread, tables set, flowers arranged in vases, the gramophone was playing, and the food was ready. And what 
food! Caviar, foie gras, quenelles, larks, grouse, pheasant, several salads, red and white wines, molded desserts, coffee, congnac, 
and champagne were the least the well-to-do picknicker could expect. Surely, this was overdoing it, but the impluse was a gay
one. Even today I feel strongly that picnics should have touches of luxury and elegance. For my own picnics I always take the largest linen 
dinner napkins I have. I prefer good china plates to paper ones. And if wine is to be served I take the Baccarat. Few things are more detestable
than good wine in  paper cups. Let the circumstances of your picnic be your guide, but include the quality touch wherever you can.

will need folding tables and folding chairs, protable ice boxes, champagne coolers, good cloths and napkins, good silver, china and
crystal, and the back of one or two of the station wagons for serving the buffets. Rigorous attention to these niceties will 
recreate great Edwardian picnic with perfect service and perfect food--and the discreet music from a good FM station in the background.

Baked Ham in Crust, Asparagus Vinaigrette, Tiny French Rolls, Frozen Raspberry Mousse, Small Cakes, Demitasse. It is my feeling that
if you are going to serve caviar you might as well go deeply into debt and have a lot of it-on ice. Serve it with toast or melba
toast, or dark bread. I like mine with lemon juice only, but you had better have some chopped onion, chopped egg, and sour cream for those who
think otherwise. Naturally, serve champagne or chilled vodka. Do not rush. Relax. Enjoy yourself. Take your time. When the caviar is cleared,
small cups of hot, double-strength consomme with chopped parsley and more melba toast will give a pleasant contrast."<br>

"Special Picnics:</b> The Picnic menus we remember best were highly repetive and reassuring. There was plenty of cold fried
chicken, potato salad, piclkes, several kinds of bread, oranges, bananas, cold lemonade, cake and watermelon. If we built a
fire, there would be weiners and baked beans. This chapter does not belittle such ceremonial food. Here, however, we divorce ourselves form 
the expected and report the discovery that food which is generally associated with snow white linen, silver, candlelight, and faultless service
tastes even better in forest shade beside a brook. Why not toast the scolding jay with champagne? Why not an epicuran picnic? Preparation for
such special events is but little more demanding than if menus were prosaic. Your special picnic might be planed around a foreign
theme--a Cantonese Picnic prepared over a hibachi, served in baskets on straw table mat, and brough to a pleasant close with
Chinese fortune or almond cookies, litchi nuts, and Chinese tea; or a Mexican Fiesta Picnic set against a gay Mexican cloth and 
featuring Taquitos and Chili Beans. Or it mahy be a spicnic served on the tailgate of a station wagon en rout to a football game or a week end
in the snow. It is to be noted that if a picnic is not on your calendar, the food ideas here are worthy of many backgrounds.

<b>[1965] "Picnics</b><br>
The English are the greatest of picnickers and have led the field for hundreds of years. They have hampers for the races, outdoor
teas for the amusement of children, and all sorts of occasions for sitting and eating in the countryside. In France along the roads
one sees families seated in collapsible chairs around a collapsible table eating and drinking with gusto. In Japan elaborate
picnic boxes may be purchased to be take to the football field or to a spot beside a placid pool. Here in America there are picnic
tables along the roadside where one may set up a simple meal or sandwiches or do a barbecue. Wherever it is done, picknickng can be
one of the supreme pleasures of outdoor life. At its most elegant, it calls for the accompaniment of the best linens and 
crystal and china; at its simplest it needs only a bottle of wine and items purchased from the local delicatessen as one passes through
town...The color and charm of the countryside can make the most modest meal taste superb. Have a picnic at the slightest excues.
It is even fun to have a box lunch and a hot drink in the car on a wintry day, while you look out at a dazzling stretch of
landscape...<b>A Festive Country or Beach Picnic--Without Sandwiches:</b> Stuffed Tomatoes, Veal or Pork Terrine, Beef a la Mode 
ed Gelee, Potato Salad or Green Salad, French Bread, Butter, Cheese, Fruit, Angel Food Cake...<b>A Champagne Picnic for 4 or 6:
</b> Macadamia Nuts, Potage Germinty, Roast Fillet of Beef, Potato and Hearts of Palm Salad, Cherry Tomatoes, French or Italian

<p>
<b>[1965] "Picnics and Barbecues</b><br>
Keep special picnic equipment packed in a basket. A wire broiler and long handled forks and
tongs are essential for broiling over a fire. A bag of charcoal for the fire avoids the necessity of
finding wood at the picnic site. A basket with an ice compartment is excellent for cream, milk,
butter, salads and relishes.<p>
"Cooking out of doors is increasingly popular the food tastes superb and work is simplified.
Out-of-door appetites are apt to be huge, so plan on at least 1/2 pound of boned meat or one
pound
with the bone for each person. Sandwiches will be at their best if you wrap them tightly, freeze,
and carry them without defrosting. Make them without lettuce--you can add lettuce when you are
ready to serve them, if you like, or serve crisp carrot or celery sticks instead.
<p>
"Hot foods are always welcome. Heat thoroughly and pack in vacuum jars or in heavy casseroles
wrapped in a thick layer of newspapers, or reheat them over the fire, rubbing the underside of the
pan with soap so that it will be easier to clean after using. Some good hot foods for picnics are
vegetable soup or minestrone, Boston baked beans, chicken fricassee, creamed or buttered
vegetables, goulash, pot roast, smothered chicken and spaghetti. Salads and other cold foods.
Green salad (the dressing carried separately in a jar, ready to add), chicken salad, mixed
vegetable salad, potato salad, baked ham, sliced roast meat loaf, savory cottage cheese, whole peeled
tomatoes, carrot curls, celery, olives, pickles.<p>
"Grilled foods. ..There are manys suggestions in the chapters on meat, fish and poultry. Among
the best are steaks, broilers (split in half), and lamb chops (marinated in French dressing). Fish,
hamburg or chopped lamb patties, sausages and frankfurters are easier to turn in the greased
folding grill or a well-salted pan. As a variation, sandwich two thin hamburg patties with a slice
of
tomato or dill pickle or with a bit of cheese, relish or chopped onion. Press firmly around the
edges. Split frankfurters and stuff with relish or a slice of cheese or wrap in bacon. Shish
Kebabs.<p>
"Brush vegetables with salad oil seasoned with salt and pepper. Good vegetables for broiling are
halved tomatoes, slices eggplant and potatoes, and wedges of zucchini and carrot. Fresh or
canned pineapple wedges, halved peaches and apricots and quartered apples are tasty as relished
with broiled meats and are delicious as dessert. Sprinkle with sugar or not as you prefer. Brown
evenly on both sides and serve hot.<p>
"Foil cooking is successful for many foods. Wrap in aluminum foil and cook on the grill.
Potatoes take about 1 hour, corn 15 minutes, frozen vegetables (with a dab of butter and a sprinkling of
salt) about 30 minutes. Dip small whole fish in salad oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and roll
in corn meal. Sprinkle fish fillets and sliced fish with salt and pepper and dot with butter. Cook
about 10 minutes on each side. Serve wrapped in the foil."<br>

"Picnics</b><br>
To make a picnic really enjoyable the food should be as well prepared as though it were served at
home. The food may be either hot or cold, but should be taken in thermos jugs so that it will be
as
advertised. Also take along all the equipment needed for everyone's comfort and convenience:
gay tablecloths and table accessories that are disposable, yet will not disintegrate in use. You
might want to pack a complete individual lunch for each person, complete with sandwiches,
salad,
beverage, dessert, and so on in a gay package. Or not pack sandwiches at all, but just bring the
makings and spread them out attractively on platters...This is one time when your best homemade
layer cake will be greatly appreciated. A big cake can usually be counted on to appease the last of
the outdoor appetites. And take along plenty to drink in the way of coffee, lemonade, or iced tea,
if you will be in a place where drinking water or cold soft drinks are not available. Don't forget
plenty of fruit."<br>

<b>GARDEN PARTIES (AKA LAWN PARTIES)</b><br>
Anyone can eat a meal outdoors. Over-the-top catered outdoor meal events are reserved for 
the privileged. Elegant American garden parties descend from European wealthy families entertaining guests in ancestral
 summer country homes. American print instructions for garden parties first surface in early 20th century texts. Completely understandable, given
the social-political-economic booming years some folks enjoyed between the Civil War & WWI. 
Decadent, leisurely, social and delicious: these
early 20th century fetes raised the American social entertainment bar a few notches. DuPont family's 
<a href="http://www.longwoodgardens.org/TheStoryofLongwood_1_3_2_1_1.html">Garden Parties</a> at Longwood
set the gold standard for this entertaining genre.
<p>
<b>[1900]<br>
"Out-Door Parties and Picnics: Garden and Lawn Parties</b><br>
One of the most agreeable forms of summer entertainments in the country, or at suburban residences, where the charm of nature spreads
 over the whole scene, is the garden or lawn party. In remote country localities these parties are very delightful, particularly if city
friends are guests for the summer, as the perfume of roses, the odor of clover blossoms, and the rustic surroundings, are charming and 
diverting to the denizens of the busy world who are tired of the artificial life of society. When properly conducted a garden party may be given with very
little trouble, and made very simple and informal, but if desired may be quite elaborate and ceremonious. When only neighbors are to be
entertained, a hasty invitation, so as to be sure of fine weather, may be sent 2 or 3 days in advance, but when guests are 
expected from any distance it is customary to send invitation 8 or 10 days in advance. These invitations are usually engraved on 
handsome, plain note paper, and may be in this form:<blockquote><center>
MR. AND MRS. CHARLES LEIGH<br>
request the pleasure of<br>
MRS. MORTONS' <br>
Company on Thursdya, the Fifth of August,<br>
at 3 o'clock.<br>
Garden Party.   Maple Grove.
</center></blockquote>
"When guests are to come by rail, it is well to send a card stating the hours at which trains arrive and leave the station. At
a garden party the hostess receives here guests on the lawn, or in the garden, wearing her hat and gloves. But guests should always
be invited to the house to take off their wraps, or arrange their toilet, if desired. The thoughtful hostess will take care to have
everything in readiness for the comfort and entertainment of the company. Rugs whould be laid on the grass for the accomodation of 
those not accustomed to stanidn on the ground, and easy chairs provided for delicate and aged ladies who may be present, so all may enjoy the 
party without fear of the consequence.
Much tact is required to properly entertain guests at a garden party, and prevent them from wandering aimlessly about the grounds.
Ample amusements must, therefore, be provided. The lawn-tennis ground msut be in perfect order, croquet sets in readiness, archery
tools supplied, as well as arrangements for all kinds of suitable games made.
<p>
"Ladies wear hats or bonnets at a garden party, and would dress otherwise appropriately. If a plain, informal affair, the dress should be
simple and becoming, and if games like lawn tennis or archery are among the amusements, light flannel dresses are suitable. But
if invited to a ceremonious lawn party, where style will previal, handsome though simple toilets are required. Picturesque 
costumes may be made very effective on the grass and under the trees, and ladies of taste have a fine field for displaying it
upon such occasions. Many very fashionable people conduct the garden party in the style of an afternoon tea, receiving and 
entertaining guests in the open air until ready to serve refreshments, when all are invited to the dining-room to partake of
them. 
<p>
"When the refreshements are to be served in the garden or lawn, of course the dishes must all be cold, and may consist of 
salads, pates, pressed meats, Charlottes, jellies, ices, cakes, lemonade and iced tea. A cup of hot tea should always be in 
readiness in the kitchen for those ladies desiring it.
Numbers of small tables, with pretty, fancy covers, and colored napkins, should be set around under the trees, near fountains and 
other suitable places, with camp-stools for the accommodation of guests when partaking of the refreshments. Gentlemen may help
the ladies, if they prefer, and wait on themselves, requiring the servants only to remove the dishes, and replenish the pitchers with
lemonade, milk, or water. Fruits and berries are served at garden parties, and should be of the finest quality. Ices are a very 
acceptable addition to an outdoor entertainment, being light and refreshing for warm weather; they are served in fancy paper-cups, laid
on ice plates. For ladies desiring to give garden parties, the following bill of fare will be found sufficient:<blockquote><center>
Cold Rolls.    Mixed Sandwiches.<br>
Brown Bread.   Pickled Tongue.<br>
Jellied Chicken.<br>
Cold Birds.   Lobster Salad.<br>

"Garden Parties</b><br>
A garden party is nothing less than a reception held out-of-doors. The only modifications are those which the place entails. There
is much in favor of making the most of the gardens, flowers, trees, and lawns on days when the weather permits. Every one enjoys the cool
shade and the abundant room on these occasions. If hostesses, in their summer residences, realized the greater comfort to their
guests, they would utilize these accessories more than they do. The fickleness of the weather is the only contingency for which
the hostess must be prepared, to meet which only reasonable foresight is necessary. When preparations are made for a gsarden party, or
fete champetre, there must also be ample provision for transferring the reception easily and quickly from the garden to the 
house in case of bad weather. If the occasion is formal, engraved invidations must be used. They are in block letters or black
script on white paper or cards, and may be worded thus: <blockquote><center>
<i>Mrs. Charles Edmund<br>
requests the pleasure of<br>
--(insert name of guest)--<br>
company on Thursday afternoon,<br>
July third,<br>
from four until seven o'clock.<br>
Garden Party.     The Bower.</i>
</center></blockquote>
"Or the invitation may take the form of an 'At Home' card with the words 'Garden Party' in the lower left-hand corner. It is desirable
to furnish your guests with necessary information about the arrival and departure of trains. On informal occasions an ordinary
letter of invitation may be sent either by mail or messenger. These notes are of such friendly tone as the acquaintance with 
the person invited will warrant. The invitations are answered in the usual way. One may prepare for the occasion according
to the style of invitation sent out, knowing that if printed cards are used the entertainment will be formal. It is a common
custom for the hostess to send her visiting card with the words 'Garden Party' on the lower left-hand corner and the time
and place on the lower right. In reply to one of these an invited guest will answer with a polite note. The preparations involved putting both
the garden and house in order. The lawn is mowed; gravel walks are rolled, and chairs are palced about in shady places and on the
verandas. The house is decorated with flowers and the doors and windows left open and inviting. The hostess may indulge her taste in 
music, and provide it in any form convenient or pleasing to her, or may omit it altogether.
<p>
"If the place is large enough to afford room for games of croquett, tennis, or golf, all of these opportunties should be offered to 
the guests. The chief amusements are of a social nature, the guests moving freely about, and partaking of refreshment. It is,
therefore, not necessary to provide a chair for each guest; but comfortable lounging places, whicker or rustic chairs, benches, and settees are always 
acceptable. It is all well to spread rugs here and there where the ground may be damp. Especial attention must be paid to the comfort of
the delicate or old. The refereshments will include such berries and fruits as may be in season, with ices, cold drinks, cakes,
sandwiches, salad, claret, or other cup, and lemonade. These are served under an awning, tent, or bower decorated with flowers,
and dispensed by servants at the call of the guests. Or this may all be inexpensively and effectively served from the shade of
the veranda.
<p>
"Punctually on the hour the hostess should order the musical programme begun. She should be ready on the lawn to greet each
arrival. She may enjoy the shade of either a hat or her parasol. As the guests arrive the are greeted by shaking hands, and are
introduced to strangers. If the attendance is very large, she will have little time for anything but greeting and adieus. Then she
must rely upon the help of her friends. If the party is a small one, she will be able to mingle with her guests and not run
the risk of failing to see a new arrival. The guests, on their arrival, enter the house, where rooms on the ground floor are
set aside for their convenience. Wraps, veils, and coats are there laid aside before boing out to greet the hostess on the 
lawn. After this guests largely entertain themselves. It is quite proper to remain during the entire afternoon, but no call should
be shorter than half an hour, during which time the guest should be as prominent as good taste allows. This is out of deference
to the hostess. If one is obliged to make only a short stay, it is well not to take formal leave of the hostess, but to slip away as quietly
as possible. When the party is very large it is customary for the quests to leave cards, either upon entering or leaving
the house.
<p>
"There is absolutely nothing to be prescribed in the way of dress for either ladies or gentlemen at a garden party. Ladies may
indulge their tastes in the lightes dresses for afternoon wear in and and every direction. Gentlemen may wear frock coat with silk
hat, or a yachting or flannel or serge suit with straw hat. Gentlemen do not wear gloves on such occasions. While in England, and in the ultra-
fashionable sets in America, gentlemen dress <i>de rigueur</i>, the greater inclination is towards an informal dress."<br>

<b>[1905]<br>
"Indoor Lawn Party</b><br>
Our social committee, of which I was then chairman, wanted very much to have a lawn party; but the season for such things was
quite over, as the evenings were too cool. However, a bright idea occurred to one of our number, and we decided to have an indoor
lawwn party. The Saturday afternoon before it was to take place, four of the committee took a team, went out into the woods, and secured a 
lot of pine boughs, autumn leaves, tec., and Monday evening, which was the evening before it occurred, we increaszed our force of 
workers, and went to the vestry to turn it, as far as possible, into an outdoor scene. We trimmed the chandeliers, posts, and 
every available spot with boughs, strung Japanese lantersn all across the room, made a beautiful bower in one corner for the
orchestra, for which we had three pieces, a piano, a violin, and a cornet. In the opposite corner of the room we had a canvas tent where
fortunes were told at five cents each (by palmistry) by one of your young lady gypsies. Hammocks were swung from the large stone
posts, and a standing double swing was placed on one side of the room, where the younger people enjoyed themselves hugely. Small
tables were put into odd corners of the room, where ice cream and cake were served by ten young ladies in pretty summer costumes. 
Lemonade was served from an aold well, which was a large square box or packing case, covered with canvas, painted to represent
a stone wall. To this we attached a well-sweep made form a branch of a tree, tied on a large new tin pail, and served the
lemonade in small glasses at two cents a glass. During the eveningwe had a male quartette gather around the well and song 'The Old Oaken
Bucket,' and other selections. The orchestra played the whole evening with very short intermissions. One one side of theroom was aranged an artistic
corner where peanuts were sold at the usual price of five cents a bag."<br>

These may be easily packed in ready-made kits obtained at almost any price, or in a suitcase
partioned off at home for the purpose. All dishes should be of paper, folding knives, spoons, and
forks may be carried. The points to be considered in planning the menu are to select foods thay
may be easily transported and to balance the meal. A course meal may be provided if desired,
soup carried in a hot-cold bottle. Meat loaf, fried chicken, broiled chicken, sliced roast beef or
ham may act as the main course, or a meat or egg salad may take its place, lettuce being carried
separately. If desired, a substantial course may be made of sandwiches. (For suggestions see

<b>[1937] RV cooking</b><p>
"Wholesome food, well prepared, is a basic requirement in the lives of all of us, and the needs of the human body do not vary in this
resepect when we go vacationing. The only real difference between appetites at home and 'in transit'is that appetites on vacation usually
are more robust. Appetites in trailers are no exception. Three meals a day can be well executed with a minimum of effort in the snug
convenience of a trailer kitchen. Adventuring in a trailer opens opportunities for adverturing in new foods, to anyone who will
explore the possibilities of this vagabond existence; and for summer camps and kitchenettes, these menus are equally
convenient. Meals for the trailer need not be drab or uninteresting. Fresh food on every roadside stand, wholesome food in cans challenging the homemaker
to feed her traveling companions interesting food, well prepared. Good food which is adequate and appetizing need not be
elaborate or intricate to prepare. It is hoped that the martyr spirit dominating homemakers of an earlier day will not reappear
in the trailer. Some of the same spirit of adventure that prompted the pioneer homemaker to feed her family well as she swayed across the continent in her
covered wagon may still be required of today's trailer homemaker. New frontiers are hers without the same hardships and 
hazards. Today's trailer homemaker, if she has taken a step in the fashionable direction of keeping up with the times, will
dominate her meals--not be dominated by them. She will plan each day's meals carefully, with the assurance that her family
is adequately fed. She will reduce their preparation to a minimum of time and effort, so that most of her day will find her free
to revel in the day's adventures in carefree, holiday mood."<br>

<b>Cooking Equipment</b><br>
"One of the first hazards to be overcome by the trailer cook is her desire to take too much cooking equipment. It is so much
easier to empty out the kitchen drawer into the trailer drawer; the pan closet into the trailer closet, then to sit down and 
question herself about each piece, 'Do I need this? Can I use this pan for a roaster as well as a frying pan?' The most important
point is to take the minimum amount of equipment with a place for every bit of it! For example, if you want to take your
electric roaster, your pressure cooker and your waffle iron, do please find a place for them in one of the cupboards. Do not let them
set out to catch dust. it is difficult enough for two or more people to live in small quarters, keeping the trailer neat and
orderly, without adding incidentals to the task....New Equipment. Look for new ideas in utensils. There are some now on the market with new ones
continually being added. Many of them are ideal for the trailer, if new equipment has to be purchased. There are pans which come
two or three to a set, with individual covers. The nest together and will fit over one burner. If an oven is needed, and a portable
one is not desired, there are ovenettes now available which are quite satisfactory. They fit over one of the the top units
on the stove, and bake in the same way as an oven. A little practice is needed, however, to learn to regulate theheat. Recently
an aluminum manufacturer of Wooster, Ohio, brought out a very useful utensil kit. The price is about nine dollars and the 
kit contains: 1 percolator, 3 different size saucepans with lids, 2 different size frying pans with lids. The lid of the
largest frying pan fits a large water pail. All of the utensils pack completely into the water pail. There are two handles 
which fit all pans. The new self draining saucepans are worth the extra pennies they cost."<br>

<b>What is a "Swiss picnic?"</b><br>
Swiss National Day, est. 1891, is celebrated August 1st with a variety of outdoor activities. One of the most popular activies is eating, including picnics. This festive 
holiday is sometimes likened to the USA's Independence Day celebration, July 4th. We find no specific connotation/definition for the term "Swiss Picnic" apart from
 the general allusion above. Several Swiss-American organizations hold annual picnics. According the information uploaded to the Internet, these are festive 
celebrations welcoming family, friends and community. Perhaps this was the allusion Larry David meant in his quote from the show <b>Curb Your Enthusiasm</b>: "It's no Swiss 
Picnic for me, either."
