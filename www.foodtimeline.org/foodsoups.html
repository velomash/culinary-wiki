Food historians tell us the history of <a href="foodsoups.html#soupword">soup</a> is probably as old as the
history of
cooking. The act of combining various ingredients in a large pot to create a
nutritious, filling, easily digested, simple to make/serve food was inevitable. This
made it the perfect choice for both sedentary and travelling cultures, rich and poor,
healthy people and invalids. Soup (and stews, pottages, porridges, gruels, etc.)
evolved according to local ingredients and tastes. New England chowder, Spanish
gazpacho, Russian borscht, Italian minestrone, French onion, Chinese won ton and
Campbell's tomato...are all variations on the same theme. 
<p>
Soups were easily digested and were prescribed for invalids since ancient times.
The modern restaurant industry is said to be based on soup. Restoratifs (wheron the
word "restaurant" comes) were the first items served in public restaurants in 18th
century Paris. Broth [Pot-au-feu], bouillion, and consomme entered here. Classic French cuisine
generated many of the soups we know today.
<p>
Advancements in science enabled soups to take many forms...portable, canned,
dehydrated, microwave-ready. <a href="foodsoups.html#portable">"Pocket soup"</a> was carried by colonial travellers, as
it could easily be reconstituted with a little hot water. Canned and <a href="foodsoups.html#soupmix">dehydrated soups</a>
were available in the 19th century. These supplied the military, covered wagon
trains, cowboy chuck wagons, and the home pantry. Advances in science also
permitted the adjustment of nutrients to fit specific dietary needs (low salt, high
fiber, etc.).
<p>
"Cereals, roasted to make them digestible and then ground and moistened or diluted with water to
make a paste, either thick or thin, did not become gruel or porridge until people had the idea and
means of cooking them. They may initially have been cooked by hot stones in receptacles of
natural substances, and then in utensils which could go straight over the fire. Soup, in fact, derives
from sop or sup, meaning the sliced of bread on which broth was poured. Until bread was
invented, the only kind of thick soup was a concoction of grains, or of plants and meat cooked in
a pot. Gruel or porridge was thus a basic food, a staple from of nourishment, and long held that
place in Western countries, for in practice bread was a luxury eaten only in towns. A thick
porridge of some kind is still the staple food of many peoples, and it is not always made of
cereals, but may consist of other starch foods: legumes, chestnuts or root vegetables."<br>

Noble Books:New York] 1992 (p. 177)
<p>
"Soup...This category included liquid foods for invalids, such as beaten egg, barley and emmer
gruel...and the water from boiling pulses, vegetables or other foods...soups or purees made from
vegetables or fruits...broth made with meal of legumes or cereals with added animal fat...and soup
in the usual modern English sense, based on meat and vetetables...Medicinal spices and herbs
might be added to these various soups, especially if they were intended for invalids as part of a
prescribed diet."<br>

"Soups. General Observations. The culinary preparations included in this section are of fairly
recent origin in their present form, dating from only the early part of the 19th century. Soups of
the old classical kitchen were in fact complete dishes in themselves and contained, apart from the
liquid content and its vegetable garnish, a wide variety of meat, poultry, game and fish. It is only
the liquid part of these classical dishes which has retained the name of soup. Examples of old style
of soup which still survive are the Flemish Hochepot, the Spanish Oilles and the French Petite
Marmite...On this point as on many others, culinary art owes much to Careme...."<br>

<b>Cold soup. Really?</b><br>
Yes! In most countries, cuisines and periods; for starters, dessert or holiday fare. We Americans are not collective fans but we are intrigued. Especially when the 
heat is on outside. Think: <a href="foodsoups.html#vichyssoise">Vichyssoise</a>, <a href="foodsoups.html#gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> & 
<a href="foodsoups.html#fruitsoup">fruit soups</a>.

<p>
"Reams have been written about the worth of good hot soup. And we're inclined to agree with much of this praise. But, in this book, cold
soup is the 'in' thing. The idea may be so strange to a number of us and so different from the bracing stimuli of hot soup, it might
be necessary to adjust our mental taste reflexes to the delicacy, the soothing quiet effect of chilled soup. We haven't been able to 
pinpoint who made the first cold soup, nor where, but notable examples of this refreshment are to be found in many countries. And 
contrary to what you might think at first, just about as many are from cold lands as from the tropics or sun countries. Russia makes a meaty hot borsch, but
their chilled beet borsch is much more popular and more of a classic. The Danes dote on chilled buttermilk soups, and all 
Scandinavians and Finns as well enjoy their cold fruit soups as a first course or dessert. Around the Mediterranean, the Greeks make a 
chilled lemon soup called Avgolemono that looks and tastes like chilled sunshine. The ways to make Spain's iced salad-soup, Gazpacho,
are without number...Yogurt, buttermilk and interesing herbs and spices such as mint, cardamom, cinnamon, fennel, etc., enhance
cool soups of the Middle East. Tropical countries all over use their lush produce to make exotic cold soups of avocado, coconut, melon, 
strange vegetables and fish of all kinds. Perhaps the all-time favorite cold soup is our own American-made original Creme Vichyssoise
Glacee creatd by the late Chef Louis Diat at the New York Ritz. It was named for his hometown, Vichy, France, and was, of course,
simply an elegant version of a popular French county potage made of leeks and potatoes. In like manner, we've found that many of the 
lovely shellfish bisques, the creamy vegetable and chicken soups so beloved by the great chers, are equally good, or better,
served cold. They seem more delicate, and refresh in a quiet, serene sort of way."<br>

"With the first breath of really warm weather, the cook starts thinking about new and wonderful cold soups. The refereshing chill and tang of these
as a first course or as a 'starter' is a wonderful nudge to one's appetite. The main thing to remember is that cold soup must be
really cold, just as hot soup must be really hot, to be good. No betwixt-and-between stuff here. Have the plates or bouillon cups
chilled too. The beading of moisture that usually forms on the cups adds to the illusion of coolness. A quick way to get soup very cold
is to pour it into the ice tray of the refrigerator. Watch it carefully from time to time so that it does not freeze. When it is just at the 
point of forming ice crystals, or in the case of jellied soup, has just jellied, take out the tray, and let it stand in the
refrigerator until you are ready to serve the soup in cups or plates. Soups chilled in this way are really cold and also do not have
the chance to absorb the odors of other foods in the refrigerator while in the lukewarm stage. Almost any soup that is good hot is good
cold, with the exception of mixed vegetable soups and broths with barley or rice. Black bean soup, with a slice of lemon and some
sherry added, is wonderful chilled. So is borstch, topped with a dab of sour cream. Add a pinch of curry powder to cold cream of
asparagus soup, and you'll have an unusual and interesting flavor. Cold potato soup, made with a little extra sour cream and a good
sprinkling of chopped chives, makes that aristocrat of cold soup, the Vichyssoise, sit up and take notice."<br>

<a name="soupword">
<b>Why the word "soup?"</b><br>
"The etymological idea underlying the word soup is that of  soaking. It goes back
to an unrecorded post-classical Latin verb suppare  soak', which was borrowed
from the same prehistoric German root (sup-) as produced in English sup and
supper. From it was derived the noun suppa, which passed into Old French as
soupe. This meant both  piece of bread soaked in liquid' and, by extension,  broth
poured onto bread.' It was the latter strand of the meaning that entered English in
the seventeenth century. Until the arrival of the term soup, such food had been
termed broth or pottage. It was customarily served with the meat or vegetable dishes
with which it had been made, and (as the dreivation of soup suggest) was poured
over sops of bread or toast (the ancestors of modern croutons). But coincident with
the introduction of the world soup, it began to be fashionable to serve the liquid
broth on its own, and in the early eighteenth century it was assuming its present-day
role as a first course."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford]
2002 (p. 316)
<a name="sops">
<p>
"Our modern word "soup" derives from the Old French word sope and soupe. The
French word was used in England in the in the form of sop at the end of the Middle
Ages and, fortunately, has remained in the English language in its original form and
with much its original sense. We say "fortunately" because it is clear that nowadays
a "sop" is not a "soup." The distinction is important. When cooks in the Middle
Ages spoke of "soup," what they and the people for whom they were cooking really
understood was a dish comprising primarily a piece of bread or toast soaked in a
liquid or over which a liquid had been poured. The bread or toast was an important,
even vital, part of this dish. It was a means by which a diner could counsume the
liquid efficiently by sopping it up. The bread or toast was, in effect, an alternative to
using a spoon...Soups were important in the medieval diet, but the dish that the cook
prepared was often a sop that consisted of both nutritious liquid and the means to
eat it. The meal at the end of a normal day was always the lighter of the two meals
of the day, and the sop appears to have had an important place in it. In fact it was
precisely because of the normal inclusion of a sop in this end-of-the-day meal that it
became called "souper" or "supper."<br>
---<i>Early French Cookery</I>, D. Eleanor Scully & Terence Scully [University of
Michigan Press:Ann Arbor] 1995 (p. 102)
<p>
"Soup. The most general of the terms which apply to liquid savory dishes...Similar terms in other languages include the Italian zuppa, the German Suppe, Danish
suppe, etc. Of the various categories of the dish which may be eaten, soup can
certainly be counted among the most basic...Its role...as an appetizing first course
should be viewed against the historical background, in which soups with solids in
them were a meal in themselves for poorer people, especially in rural areas..."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University
Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 735)<br>
[NOTE: This book has separate historical entries on several popular soups. Ask
your librarian to help you find a copy.]
<p>
<a name="eatsoup">
<b>Why do we "eat" rather than "drink" soup? </b><br>
Etiquette experts tell us we "eat," rather than "drink" soup because it is considered part of the
meal.
Additionally, in most cultures soup is consumed with a spoon rather than sipped from the
container.
Consistency (clear broth, chunky chicken vegetable, creamy cold cucumber), preparation (puree,
reduction,
simmer, dried), and ingredients (meat, vegetable, strarch, dairy, fruit) do no factor into this
particular
equation.
<p>
"The liquid element in a meal is either placed first and "eaten" as a soup, with a spoon, or it is
poured over
the solids as sauces, gravies, creams, or syrups. The accompanying drink is kept separate,
standing outside
the meal: literally standing in a high glass, and literally outside, beyond the cutlery fence bounding
the
"place."...We...carry the liquid in our beer and wineglasses directly to our mouths."

<b>Culture/cuisine variations</b><br>
You can study these by examining current and historic cuisine-specific cookbooks.
Here you will find popular/traditional recipes. Some of these books also contain
historic notes. Books concentrating on specific eras/countries (classical Greece,
Medieval Europe, 19th century Russia, etc.) are good for background. Reay
Tannahill's <i>Food in History</i> is an excellent place to learn about the
prehistoric origins of cooking. If you are a culinary student check your school's
library. It most likely has the books you need to complete this assignment. If you
need help identifying books written on a specific place/time we can provide you
with titles. Your librarian can arrange to obtain them for you. Sorry, we do not find
a comprehensive book covering the history of all soups in all places through time.
<p>
<b>Specific soup types</b><br>
Looking for a case study? We recommend Andrew F. Smith's <i>Souper
Tomatoes</i>. This informative book tracks the origin and evolution of tomato soup. It also
includes historic recipes.

<b>ABOUT STOCK</b><br>
"Stock. Etymologically, stock is simply something one keeps a <i>stock</i> of for use. Nowadays
usually
conveniently conjured up by adding water to a commercial preparation (the term stock cube is not
recorded
until as recently as the 1960s; American English still prefers the more refined-sounding bouillon
cube,
which dates from the 1930s), stock is traditionaly the product of a pot kept constantly simmering
on the hob,
to which odds and ends of meat, bones vegetables, etc. are added from time to time to keep up a
continuous <i>stock</i> for flavoury broth as a basis for soups, stews, sauces, etc...In practice,
few households or
restaurants have the sort of constantly available source of low heat necessary for this perpetually
self-renewing stockpot, and most stock is made afresh in individual batches as needed."<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p.
325)
<p>
<b>[1653]<br>
"1. Mushroom stock.</b> Get the worst of your mushrooms, wash them carefully with their skin and stems on, without removing anything. 
Boil them in a pot with good blouillon; as they boil, put in a bouquet of herbs, an onion stuck with whole cloves and a few bits of
roast meat, everything well seasoned with salt. After it has all boiled well, put it through a strainer; put it into a pot to use it as
you need it. This can be used in all sorts of ragouts, even pottages, and often it can be used in place of mutton stock.
<b>2. Beef or Mutton Stock.</b> Cook your meat, whether beef or mutton, a little less than half. PRick it with a knife and pressit in a press if you have one
becasue that will be much more effective. When the meat is pressed and the juice is extracted, get a spoonful of bood bouillon and baste hyour meat
wtih it, and again extract as much juice as you can to make up what you need. Put it into a pot with a little salt. Mix the juice
of a lemon into it when you are ready to use it."<br>
---<i>La Varenne's Cookery</i>, A Modern English Translation and Commentary by Terence Scully, <i>The French Cook</i>, Chapter XXI, "Mushroom, Beeef or Mutton Stocks which can be used in many sauces
and ragout preparations,"  [Prospect Books:Devon] 2006 (p. 226) 
<p>
<b>[1869]</b><br>
"General stock, or Grand Bouillon, is the principle of all the soups and sauces which follow; it is
used instead of water, to which it is much to be preferred. General Stock is made with legs of
beef, knuckles of veal, and any fresh meat trimmings and bones. Cut all the meat from the bones;
break them; and put them, together with the meat, in a stock-pot, with about 2 1/2 pints of cold
water to each pound of bones and meat; and add a little salt, and put on the fire to boil; skim
carefully; and put in some carrots, onions, and leeks; simmer for five hours; strain the Stock
through a broth napkin, into a basin, and keep it in a cold palce, till wanted."<br>
---<i>The Royal Cookery Book</i>, Jules Gouffe, Translated from the Fench and Adapated for
English Use by Alphonse Gouffe [Sampson Low, Son, and Marston:London] 1869  (p. 226)
<p>
<b>[1875]</b><br>
"Stock is the bassis of all meat sauces, soups, and purees. It is really the juice of meat extracted by
long and gentle simmering, and in making it, should be remembered that the object to be aimed at
is to draw the goodness out of the materials into the liquor. It may be prepared in various ways,
richly and expensively, or economically, and recipes for all modes are given in this work. All
general stock, or stock which is to be used for miscellaneous purposes, should be simply made,
that is, all flavoring ingredients should be omitted entirely until its use is decided upon. The stock
will then keep longer than it would do if vegetables, herbs, and spices were boiled in it, besides
which the flavouring can be adapted to its special purpose. To ensure its keeping, stock should be
boiled and skimmed every day in summer, and every other day in winter. The pan and the lid used
in making it should be scrupulously clean. A tinned iron pan is the best for the purpose. Those
who need to practise economy will do well to procure a digester, which is a kind of stock-pot
made with the object of retaining the goodness of the materials, and preventing its escape in
steam. When ready, stock should be poured into an earthenware pan, and left uncovered until it is
cold. It should on no account be allowed to cool in a metal pan. Before being used, every particle
of fat which has settled on the surface should be removed, and the liquor should be poured off
free from sediment. A few years ago it was customary for cooks to make stock with fresh meat
only, the rule being a pound of meat to a pint of stock. Altered prices have necessitated the
adoption of more economical methods, and now excellent stock is constantly made with the bones
and trimmings of meat and poultry, with the addition or not of a little fresh meat, or a portion of
Liebig's Extract of Meat. In a house where meat is regularly used, a good cook will never be
without a little stock. Broken remnants of all kinds will find their way to the stock-pot, and will
not be thrown away untily, by gentle stewing, they have been made to yield to the utmost
whatever of fresh meat is used it is better for being freshly killed. The liquor is which fresh meat
has been boiled should always be used as stock."<br>

Co.:London] 1875? (p. 924-5)<br>

<b>ABOUT BROTH</b><br>
"Etymologically, broth is  that which has been brewed'; the word comes ultimately from the same
prehistoric
Germanic source as modern English brew. From earliest times it was used for the  liquid in which
something is boiled', and the  something' could be vegetable as well as animal...By the seventeenth
century
it was becoming largely restricted to the  liquid in which meat is boiled', and more particularly to a
thin soup
made from this with the addition of vegetables, cereal grains, etc. (the term Scotch broth dates
from at least
the early eighteenth century)...The proverb "Too many cooks spoil the broth' is first recorded in
Sir
Balthazar Gerbier's <i>Three Chief Principals of Magnificent Building</i>, 1665."<br>

"Broth. A term which usually means the liquid in which meat has been cooked or a simple soup

thereon. It is a close equivalent to the French bouillon and the Italian brodo, but difference

languages
have give it...a flavour of its own. The word comes from a root which means simply to brew,
without
specifying the presence of meat, and there are early examples of broths made with just
vegetables...However, for several centuries, broth has usually implied meat. It has also been
prominent in
invalid cookery...It could be said that broth occupies an intermediate position between stock and
soup. A
broth (e.g. chicken broth) can be eaten as is, whereas a stock (e.g. chicken stock) would normally
be
consumed only as an ingredient in something more complex. A soup, on the other hand, would
usually be
less simple, more  finished', than a broth."<br>

<b>ABOUT COURT BOUILLON</b><br>
"Court bouillon. A court bouillon (in French literally  short bouillon') is a light stock used mainly
for poaching
fish or shellfish in. It is made from water and the usual mixture of stock vegetables (onions,
carrots, celery)
and herbs, with the optional addition of white wine or (particularly for freshwater fish) vinegar.
The term has
been used in English texts since the early eighteenth century, but Eliza Acton in her Modern
Cookery (1845)
made it clear that cooking with court bouillon was still far from an everyday event:  court
bouillon--a
preparation of vegetables and wine, in which (in expensive cookery) fish is boiled.'"<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p.
92-3)
<p>
"Court buillon. A flavored liquid intended for the cooking of eggs, vegetables, or seafood, and in
use in
France and elsewhere for many centuries. In modern times its use is reserved almost exclusively
for
seafood, especially fish..In early Englsih cookery books the term is ofent spelled strange ways,
e.g.
courbolion (May, 1685). However, there was little difference between early English recipes and
early
French ones. La Varenne...gave several recipes for fish cooked in a court bouillon...Stobart
(1980) points
out that: "Meats and vegetables are less often cooked court-bouillon for an obvious reason. A
court-bouillon
is prepared in advance by boiling the flavouring ingredients before the food it put in to cook. This
is necessary with fish, and shell fish, as they spend only a short time in the cooking liquid. But the
meats and
vegetables, which take longer to cook, the flavouring materials can usually be boiled while the
food is
cooking.""<br>

<b>Ude's recipe, 1828</b><blockquote>
<b>"Court Buillion. </b><br>
Take three carrots, four onions, six shallots, and two roots of parsley, which pick and wash.
Mince them. Put

brown.
Moisten next with two bottles of red wine, a bottle of water, a handful of salt, some whole

What is the difference between soup and stew? On the most basic level there is no absolute difference. Like ancient pottage, both soup and stew descend from economical, easy, 
healthy, forgiving, and locally sourced family feeds. Throughout time, these two interrelated menu items converge and diverge. Modern American cultural context does, however, 
separate soup from stew quite simply. The test is not in the ingredients or method, but which course it is served. Soup is starter/accompaniment; stew is main course. 
<p>
Soup, in some contexts, variously became regarded as haute cuisine (consomme, vichyssoise), healthful restoratifs (18th century French Restaurants & Jewish grandmother 
chicken soup), and economical family fare (commercial vegetable beef, tomato). Soup can be served as first course 
(classic menu), lunch (paired with sandwich or salad) and dessert (fruit soup). It can be served hot
 (most) or cold (gazpacho, cucumber).  Either way, the stock reigns supreme. 
<p>
Stew is generally appreciated in larger chunks as main course, always served warm. Slow cooking renders tough cuts of meat delicious. The fact "stew" was a verb before it was a 
noun means much. Deliberate slow cooking with minimal moisture produces amazing results. Stew is generally regarded as
 community feed (<a href="foodmeats.html#brunswickstew">
Brunswick Stew</a>, <a href="foodsoups.html#burgoo">Kentucky Burgoo</a> & <a href="foodmeats.html#booya">Booya</a>) or family
 fare; not eligible for haute cuisine. 
<p>
The best way to compare definitions of two terms is take them from the same source. It is interesting to note Escoffier does not attempt to define the differences. If you're examining the differences within a specific culture/cuisine/period context, compare soup and stew recipes offered in cookbooks serving your target period. Menus confirm meal placement.

Soup mix, as we Americans know it today, descends from <a href="foodsoups.html#portable">portable soups</a> consumed by explorers,
soldiers, and travelers for hundreds of years. Rehydration is a simple and economical way to serve
hot nourishment when standard recipes are not possible. 
<p>
A survey of historic American newspaper articles and food history sources confirm dried soup
mixes were introduced to the general consumer in the 1930s. The market blossomed in the 1940s,
when several companies agressively promoted a variety of flavors to busy housewives. The hook?
Convenience (quick, easy), economics (mixes were inexpensive) and versatility (mixes could be
used to create sauces for casseroles, gravies for meats/vegetables, and dips for snacks). 
Of all these products, the most famous is Lipton's Onion Soup Mix. Why? In the early 1950s a
recipe for <a href="foodsoups.html#californiadip">California Dip</a>, combining this product with sour cream,
caught the attention of the
American palate. This classic dip is still beloved by many today.

The Thomas J. Lipton Company appeared to have started the parade earlier this year with
numerous test campaigns on Contintental Noodle Soup mix in newspapers. Since that time
General Mills, with its Betty Crocker noodle soup mix, Skinner and Eddy Corporation with its

<b>How good were these early products & how were they received?</b><br>
USA commercial dry soup mix reviewed by <i>Consumer Reports</i> 1963 & 1978 says it all. <p>
<b>[1963]</b><br>
"Americans, while giving lip service to the truism that there's nothing-like-a-plate-of-old-fashioned-home-made-soup, annually consume countless platefuls of the 
ready-made kind. The every-simmering pot of soup stock long since has gone from the kitchen, put to rout first by the convenience of canned soups and now by the
 even greater handiness of dry-mix soups, which are making their mark on the market. Light and compact, dry-mix soups take up less pantry space than cans and 
are easier to tote home from the store or out to a campsite. But how do they really compare with the home-made soups of memory? With canned condensed 
soups? With each other? To answer these simple though subjective questions, CU chose a number of staff members who demonstrated in tryouts that they could 
reproduce their soup judgements; that is, when given a series of unidentified soups to taste and describe, they gave a similar flavor description each time they tasted
 a particular soup. These individuals, none of whom could be considered a gourmet, served as panelists to examine the soups prepared from the mixes, and to 
describe, independently of each other, the taste odor, and texture characteristics, noting particularly any brand-distinguishing features. The test covered six leading 
brands of dried soups--Campbell's, Red Kettle, Goodman's Knorr, Lipton, Mrs. Grass, and Wyler's--in the most popular flavors, chicken noodle, beef noodle, 
onion, and green pea. The panel also tasted Campbell's canned soups in the same four flavors. In each case the tasters did not know either the type or the brand 
they were sampling. The verdict, briefly, was: First, none of the soups tasted as good to the panelists as the home-made soups they knew or remembered. Second, 
the tasters preferred dry-mix-noodle and onion soups to the canned versions, mainly because the noodles and onions were firmer and the onions also crisper. An 
third, different brands of dry-mix soups seemed to cater to different tastes. Generally speaking, the panel described Campbell's Red Kettle and Lipton soups as 
having 'a true flavor.' The Knorr soups were described as heavily spiced and well garnished, a quasi-European impression emphasized in recent advertising for this 
American-made version of a famous old Swiss line. A fourth brand, Wyler's, was judged relatively weak in flavor, with bouillon-like overtones...The dry soups, but 
the way, were found as easy to prepare as the canned condensed type, although the lump of soup stock in Wyler's chicken noodle mixed dispersed rather slowly 
and had to be broken up with a mixing spoon. Most brands are conveniently packaged in pouches containing the makings of two to five portions, depending on the 
brand and your own idea of portion size. Campbell's Red Kettle comes two small cans to the box. Except in the green pea mixes tested, the packaged ingredients 
were not distributed uniformly enough to permit preparation of only part of a package. In general, you can expect to pay less per serving of dry-mix soups than of 
canned condensed. For example, an eight-ounce serving of chicken noodle soup from a dry-mix may cost from 2 1/2 cents for the Wyler's to 6 1/2 cents for 
Campbell's Red Kettle or Knorr, against 7 1/2 cents for canned condensed Campbell's Chicken Noodle. Be careful reading the ingredients, which (as informed 
consumers know) are listed on food labels in order of their proportion by weight in the package, will indicate that dry-mix soups are by no means the bargains their 
package advertising often makes them out to be. Take the beef and chicken soup mixes. package pictures often play up the meat content...but every brand of 
chicken or beef noodle mix except Campbell's Red Kettle listed more salt than meat in the mix. The minimum amount of chicken in any product called chicken soup,
 when sold in interstate commerce, is set by the Poultry Inspection Division of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. When the mixes tested by CU were packed, this 
agency required a minimum of 2% chicken meat as a preparation of the dry mix. A typical 1 1/2-ounce packet of chicken soul thus could contain as little as .03 
ounce of dried chicken; a single serving, as little as .01 ounce. As of last March, and after much haggling, this definition of chicken soup was changed so that the 2%
 chicken-meat minimum applied to the reconstituted, ready-to-serve soup rather than to the dry mix. This boosted the legal minimum of chicken meat in a typical s
erving all the way up to about .04 ounce. It may be that some consumers are content with chicken as a flavor, and don't expect to find much of the bird itself; it is
 true that no type of chicken soup is known to offer chicken meat on any substantial scale. Still, .04 ounce is down to a pretty fine scale. And there remains the 
question of what to call the mixes which offer less than that or even no chicken meat at all. Since these products are not considered poultry products, the Food and 
Drug Administration has jurisdiction over them; it is currently pondering phrases like 'noodle soup mix, chicken flavored' or 'imitation chicken flavor' or 'soup
 flavored with chicken fat.' CU suggests 'mock chicken soup' or perhaps 'chicanery soup.' Because even standards like those for chicken meat in chicken soup are 
as yet entirely lacking for other dry-mix soups, vigilance by the consumer is especially important for these products. Complaints to the FDA...about beef soup 
without beef, ham soup without ham, bacon soup without bacon, may help bring the day when consumers can trust the big print on the labels of a great many more 
prepared foods than now merit that confidence."<br>---<i>Consumer Reports</i>, May 1963 (p. 225-226)<br>
 [NOTE: ratings of "acceptable" soups, by flavor, offer brief descriptions of flavor, texture and price. They are not ranked best--worst.]
<p>
<b>[1978] </b><br>
"Consider homemade chicken soup. It contains chicken, vegetables, and rice or noodles. As the soup cooks, flavors and nutrients form those ingredients are 
released into the broth. The soup tastes good. And while it won't cure a cold or anything else, it is an ideal fluid replacement when you're sick. Now consider the 
dehydrated soups tested for this report. Judging from their labels, the soups' vitamin content is practically nil. A principal seasoning is salt, which most Americans 
need less of, not more of. The soups' flavor, which wasn't especially good, was usually helped long with generous doses of monosodium glutamate (MSG), a 
chemical compound that contains sodium and causes unpleasant symptoms in some people. And there's evidence that some dried soups are manufactured with less 
than tender, loving care. But dried soup mix is certainly convenient. If you can stew a pot of water on the range, you can fix a dried soup. With a regular mix, you 
just add powder to the water and cook. With an instant mix, you add hot water to the powder in a cup and drink. We tested 43 regular and instant mixes --chicken
 soup (the most popular variety), beef soup, and a variety of vegetable soups, including tomato. You won't find a list of nutrients on the labels of these powders. 
There'd be precious little to put on such a list. According to published figures, thiamin is the most plentiful important nutrient in Lipton Chicken Noodle Soup. One 
serving's thiamin content equals some 7 percent of the RDA [Recommended Daily Allowance] for a woman. Other nutrients listed in the Lipton soup ranged from 
0.4 to 3.9 percent of the RDA. Standard sources show other dried soup mixes are similarly low in nutrients. What about protein? We checked to see. Most of the 
soups come in six- or eight ounce portions. Of those soups, all but one provided less than four grams of protein per portion...The exception is Lipton Cup-A-Soup 
Green Pea, which provided 5.4 grams. Four of the soups come in 15-ounce portions and consist mostly of needles. Thanks mainly to the noodles, those four 
provide about eight to nine grams of protein per portion--a good contribution to a person' daily protein need. While low in vitamins and minerals, the dried soups 
are higher in carbohydrates--or sugars and refined starches--than soup should be. Most of the ingredient labels indicate one or more (usually more) of the following 
sugars: corn sweeteners, sugar, dextrose, and lactose. In addition, most of the soups list one or more of the following starches: potato starch, corn starch, modified 
food starch, wheat starch, and various flours. All those added sugars and starches have little nutritional value. We analyzed for sucrose, or common table sugar. 
Some soups contained no sucrose. Most were fairly low in sucrose. The tomato soups were higher than the other products, containing 2 1/2 to 6 grams--about a 
teaspoon--per serving. Calories per portion were usually fairly low. The soups in six- and eight-ounce portions generally provided form 30 to 80 calories. The 
15-ounce 'noodle' soups provided 320 calories or so--about what you'd get with a bowl of noodles. What's in the soups, aside from dehydrated chicken, beef, 
vegetables, or noodles? The ingredients list on a typical dried soup reads a bit like the index to a chemistry textbook. We could have analyzed for months to 
determine how much of what is in each dried soup. We didn't. Instead, we've given a guide to dried-soup additives...and analyzed only for sodium and
 monosodium glutamate. Our taste experts judged that saltiness was the major flavor characteristic of the tested soups. Salt is approximately 40 percent sodium. 
Most of the soups contained between 700 and 900 milligrams of sodium per portion. A few were somewhat lower. And 12 were astonishingly high--about 1040 to
 1630 milligrams per portion. With those, you get about one-half to three-quarters teaspoon of salt per serving...Monosodium glutamate is used in dried soups as a
 flavor enhancer. many people can ingest MSG without experiencing side effects. But some individual experience what's been called the 'Chinese restaurant 
syndrome,' which consists of a variety of uncomfortable, temporary symptoms, including a burning sensation throughout the body, upper chest pain, facial pressure, 
and headache. All the tested dried soups but Kroger Cup-of-Soup Cream Style Chicken Flavor list MSG as an ingredient. And our analysis of the Kroger showed
 it contained glutamic acid, the main component of MSG. Most of the soups contained between 500 and 800 milligrams of MSG per portion. Some contained less. 
And some contained more than 1000 milligrams per portion. The soup with the highest amount, Wyler's Chicken Flavored Rice, had about one-quarter teaspoon 
per six-ounce portion...How does this conglomeration of dried foods and chemicals taste after you've drowned its sorrows in hot water? We asked our sensory 
consultants to taste the stuff. None of the regular dried soups was judged better than Good; note of the instants was judged better than Fair. Unlike good 
homemade soups (such as CU's chicken soup...the dried soups contained few natural flavors, aromas, and textures. Some had artificial and 'off' flavors. Most
 tasted very salty...Recommendations: Dried soup mixes don't have much to recommend them. Even the best of the tested soups didn't taste like a good homemade
 soup. Most were high in sodium and MSG...As an alternative to the dried soups, you might heat up a canned soul. Pour sensory consultants tried a canned chicken
 noodle soup, a vegetable beef soup, and a tomato soup. All tasted a bit better than the dried soups. Canned soups in general should also contain more nutrients
 than dried soups. But, if the three soups we analyzed are any yardstick, canned soups (per manufacture's suggested portion) contain as much sodium as the worst
 of the dried soups and only a bit less MSG than the run of the dried soups. If you want nutritious soup that tastes good, try making your own. In the box below we
 give a recipe for CU's chicken soup. It costs about the same per portions as a dried soup. It's not exactly a convenience food. But once you cook it, you can
 freeze what you don't eat. If you sometimes have dried soup because it's convenient, try making it with skim milk or nonfat dry milk; the soup will baster better and 
be more nutritious, too. As for choosing among the tested soups, you're on your own. You can choose one rated Good over one rated Fair, but that still leaves you
 with so-so taste, low nutrition, sodium, and MSG. We calculated each soup's cost per serving using the serving size designated by the manufacturer. The regular 
soups were usually cheaper.Most of them cost from 6 to 10 cents per serving; the instants usually cost from 13 to 15 cents. The Maruchan instants, at 57 cents per 
serving, and the Nissin instants, at 58 cents, give you about 2 1/2 times the soup for about three or four times the price of the other instants. 
<p>
<a name="cuchickensoup">
<b>NOW THIS IS SOUP! </b><br>
As an alternative to dried soup, why not make your own? To get you started, here's our recipe for a hearty chicken stock (see any cookbook) which takes some 
time to prepare. <br>
1 tablespoon chicken fat skimmed from homemade chicken stock <br>
1 clove garlic, finely chopped <br>
4 ounces uncooked dark-meat chicken, cut up<br> 
1 medium carrot, diced <br>
1 large celery stalk with leaves, diced <br>
1 very large scallion (green onion), diced <br>
4 cups homemade chicken stock <br>
1/4 cup egg noodles, broken up <br>
1/2 tablespoon parsley, finely chopped <br>
1/2 teaspoon salt <br>
1/8 teaspoon pepper <br>
Melt the chicken fat in a large pot. Add garlic. Saute. Add the chicken. Stir the mixture occasionally as you dice the carrot, celery, and scallion. Add the vegetables
 to the pot. Saute a few minutes to soak up any remaining fat. Add stock. Bring to boil. Add noodles. Boil five to seven minutes until noodles are al dente. Add
 parsley, salt, and pepper just before serving. The soup tastes much better when the chicken meat that does into it is dark meat. Our recipe makes about eight six-
ounce cups of soup and costs from 7 cents to 14 cents per portion. Our calculations showed that CU's chicken soup provided more protein than most of the tested 
chicken soups--5 grams per six-ounce cup of soup, or about 10 percent of a woman's RDA./ It contained a lot less sodium--about 185 milligrams per portion. And 
it contains no MSG or additives like those in the dried chicken soups. CU staffers who tried our homemade chicken soup thought it tasted just great. One staffer 
praised its 'good chicken flavor.' Another loved it because the vegetables 'were nice and firm.' Still another enjoyed it because it was 'nicely full of stuff.'" <br>

Before we had canned alphabet soup, we had alphabet-shaped pasta (aka alphabet pastes) that were marketed specifically to American consumers as a novelty soup additive. Then, as now, spelling out words with soup pasta was fun for all ages. Our survey of historic newspapers confirms some parents declared their children brilliant because they were "soup spelling" at very early ages. 
The term "Alphabet Soup" also has another meaning in the American Lexicon. During the New Deal Era (FDR) new federal programs were springing up at an amazing pace. These programs were known by their acronyms. Newspaper reporters and political commentators regularly referred to this phenomenon as Alphabet Soup politics. The attribution was not a favorable one.

Contemporary cookbooks hail this creamy soup as the "national" soup of Greece. Similar recipes, in both soup and sauce forms,
are also found in contemporary Turkish and Arab cuisine. Culinary combinations of egg and lemon are not native to the
region, as evidenced in ancient texts. This suggests avgolemono was introduced at a later date. Food historians
trace the origins to southern Europe, suggesting the dish traveled to Greece with Sephardic Jews.

"Avgolemono literally 'egg-lemon' the Greek name of a characteristic E. Mediterranean sauce. The name in Arabic (tarbiya) and Turkish (terbiye) literally means 
'treatment; improvement'. Avgolemono may be used either as a sauce for fish, lamb, or vegetables (particularly artichoke) or as a flavouring in various casserole 
dishes and soups (which it also thickens)." <br>

"Greece's long connection with the Venetian Republic accounts for some of the culinary influences that appear Italian. But it does seem that the Venetians learned a 
thing or two from Greece. For example, the Venetian manzo alla greca derives from the Greek original as seen in (besides the name) the basic avgolemono, or 
lemon and egg yolk sauce. This sauce was popular in Venice and was also used in another preparation known as bolito alla cortigiana...However, at least one 
scholar believes the influence on both Greek and Venetian dishes may come much later, from French cuisine, because of the use of eggs in the sauce, derived from 
French-style compound sauces."<br>

"Avgolemono. This egg and lemon combination is a Greek favorite sauce and soup. But it is also considered a cornerstone of Sephardic cooking. Claudia Roden's 
fascinating book on Jewish food has several recipes for this as a sauce, and she suggests that it was probably Portuguese or Spanish in origin. Made like a custard, it is similar in 
flavor to a hollandaise, but much lighter and fresher in the absense of large amounts of butter." <br>

 characteristic Sephardi ways of cooking fish. The sauce is known to us all as Greek and Turkish, but it also appears in early Iberian communities in
 countries such as England, Holland, and Denmark--where the Ottoman and Greek influence was hardly felt. The earliest Jewish cookbook published
 in England, in 1846, which had mostly Portuguese dishes, is full of egg-and-lemon sauces. The one for fish was adopted by the Eastern European 
immigrants, and 'halibut with egg-and-lemon sauce' is one of the most common Friday-night dishes in Britain today. If I have to name one city that

<a name="bigos">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Bigos</b></font><br>
Bigos is considered by some to be Poland's "national dish." Dating back in print and practice for hundreds of years, this
dish evolved according to time and place. Each family had its own special recipe. This gently stewed layered compostiton
features foods of the people: cabbage (fresh or sauerkraut), leftover meat (sausage, beef cubes), and root vegetables
 (onions, turnips). Holiday variations incorporate middle eastern fruits (dates, raisins, prunes). Contemporary recipes sometimes
embrace tomatoes (paste, diced). This dish is known in other countries by different names. 
<p>
"Mikolaj Rej did not mention bigos specifically in any of his writings during the sixteenth century, so the dish must have assumed 
its more familiar name and form within the past three hundred years. Bigos was initially composed of mixed game, which by definition was food 
reserved for the nobility. It has evolved over time into a more egalitarian preparation, since many Poles make it today, although 
rarely with game. It is even available in most Polish pubs and bistros. Some Polish etymological material has suggested that the word 
bigos is...from the German Bleiguss. This is not a food, but something associated with a custom: pouring molten lead into 
cold water on New Year's Day. The resulting strangely shaped flakes of metal are then studied to predict the future. This etymology is doubtless 
erroneous, although bigos was probably a modification of a medieval German dish. The archaic German verb becken (to cut up or chop and 
equivalent to the old English verb bray) would offer a more promising possibility. So would Beifuss, which appears in old German as biboz, bivuoz, and other 
variations. Beifuss is a term for mugwort (Artemesia vulgaris), a popular medieval condiment for meats. In any case, we do know what 
bigos is in medieval terms, since it is made with leftovers and was originally structured in layers. It is similar to the cabbage-and-meat 
mixture known as choucroute alsacienne, although the ingredients in that preparation are not chopped up into small pieces, which may be one of the 
keys to the origin of bigos. Perhaps it is rather more like another Alsatian dish, pote boulangere (Baeckoffe), which descends from the medieval compostium 
(meaning a mixture). This braised layered dish made with cabbage, leftover meats, and fruit is known as Gumbistopel in parts of Bas-Rhin 
and Switzerland. It is traditionally made in many parts of southern German and Austria, where it still survives under numerous dialect 
designations. it is also indigenous to the old Saxon cookery of Transylvania and has thus evolved into many variant forms in 
Hungarian cookery. It would be tempting to point toward a Hungarian avenue for the introduction of bigos into Poland, given the flow of 
other culinary ideas from that part of Europe. But it is also true that Hedwig of Andechs-Meran (d. 1243), later known in Poland as Saint 
Hedwig of Silesia, would have been perfectly at home with this dish during her thirteenth-century youth in the Bavarian monastery at 
Kitzingen. The medieval origins of bigos are oddly alluded to in a most un-medieval source: the Paradok molodym khozajkam (A Gift to 
Young Housewives), a nineteenth-century Russian cookbook. The author, Elena Molokhovets, never explained where she found her recipe for 
Polish bigos, but her procedure for making it involved the older, the more medieval technique of layering the ingredients in line with the structure 
of a compositum. The significant part is at the beginning of her recipe, where she layers the bacon and cabbage. This step was technically 
unnecessary because she could have chopped them just as easily. She was evidently remaining faithful to an older recipe format, yet 
she was obliged to stew the dish because she was preparing it on a cookstove. The layering aspect is the connecting element, and in the 
Middle Ages this initial step was easily performed in an oven or braised under coals. The medieval Polish kitchen was supplied with a number of 
utensils that could be used to accomplish this--in fact the whole dish could be prepared this way. The most typical implement was a three-legged 
dutch oven made of earthenware. Such a pot (missing its lid) was excavated from a thirteenth-century site in Warsaw' Old Town, although the 
archaeological report misidentified it as a patelnia (skillet). If the rest of Molokhovets's ingredients had also been added in layers the result would still be 
bigos. In fact, if the recipe for cabbage compositum with mushrooms...is combined with the chicken baked with prunes..., 
the mixture would remind most Poles of bigos. What separates the modern Polish dish from its medieval roots is the subtle alteration in structure and procedure 
that took place as the recipe shifted from hearth to stove cookery. While bigos is stewed today, it is not sloppy with liquid because the 
stewing is intended to cook it down. In any case, the preparation should be thick like Sicilian caponata, which is why Poles today serve it as an 
hers d'oeuvre on toast or bread before a formal meal." <br>

"In the treasury of Old Polish culinary recipes bigos is one of the most precious jewels. Its traditions go back far into the past and the future 
predicts further long-lasting popularity for this dish. In older days bigos, stored in wooden casks or great stoneware pots, was a necessary 
component of a well-equipped pantry. Reheating the bogs many times only adds to the flavor and aroma. Thus an unexpected guest could be 
served bigos, or it was eaten on hunting expeditions, when it was heated in a kettle hung over an open fire. A cask of bigos was taken 'for the 
road', since it was part of the classical Old Polish traveling food supply. It was also served during carnival, at Easter feasts and on many other 
occasions. The tastiest bigos was made during Christmas and Easter, as there was a great variety of meat and game on hand, and these make up 
the essence of bigos. We fin many good words about this dish in Old Polish literature...Bigos is a composition not only complex, but also with a 
great many variants. In each Old Polish kitchen it was made in a different way, in accordance with home traditions. Thus, there was hunting bigos, 
Lithuanian bigos, rascal's bigos and others, made with sauerkraut, with sauerkraut and fresh cabbage and with fresh cabbage only. Take 3 lbs. 
sauerkraut of fresh cabbage for 2 lbs. various beats (kielbasa or ham should prevail). Equal parts of sauerkraut and fresh cabbage may also be 
taken. Some, however, take 3 lbs. assorted meats for 2 lbs. cabbage (sour or fresh) and no one has said anything against these generous Old 
Polish proportions, especially since this practice appears to be rare today. The assorted meats should consist of the following, cut into cubes: port 
roast, roast beef, joint of pork cooked in vegetables, a piece of roast duck and sliced kielbasa (better: various kinds of sausages if possible, along 
with lean cooked ham cut into cubes). The addition of roast game raises the flavour of bigos considerably, but without game it will be just as 
excellent. Sauces from roast meats are also added to the bigos. The sauerkraut can be chopped and fresh cabbage can be thinly sliced and 
scalded with boiling water before cooking. Cook the cabbage over low heat in a small amount of water (better: in the stock from cooked kielbasa). 
If only fresh cabbage is used, add 1 1/2 lbs. sour apples, peeled and finely chopped, towards the end of cooking. Apples are also added to 
sauerkraut, but in a smaller amount (4 large sour apples). Separately, cook at least 2 oz. dried mushrooms. Slice the cooked mushrooms thinly and 
add to the cabbage and heat along with the stock. now add 2 large, finely chopped onions lightly browned in lard or butter. If a richer bigos is 
preferred, fry the onions in 2-4 oz. lard. While the bigos is simmering, add 20 prunes (stoned), cut into strips. The prunes may be substituted 
by 1-2 tablespoons well fried plum butter. Season the bigos with salt, pepper and, if desired, with a little sugar. It should be sharper in taste. 
Finally, add 1/2-2/3 cup dry red wine or Madeira. After adding all the ingredients cook the bigos over low heat for 40 minutes (careful: stir often, 
as it tends to burn). Next day, reheat the bigos. It is tastiest and 'mature' after the third reheating. Some add a roux of flour lightly browned in 
fat, which makes the bigos thicker, But if the bigos is well cooked, in our opinion, this addition is unnecessary. The bigos may also be seasoned 
with a tablespoon of thick tomato paste. Old Polish cuisine does not make use of this because it was not known then. But we strongly recommend 
the addition of tomato paste. Cook the bigos in an enameled or cast-iron enameled pot, but never in an aluminum one. Serve it very hot. 
Whole-wheat (or white) bread is served separately, along with a glass of chilled vodka (Wyborowa, Rye or Zubrowka), which 
improves digestion." <br>

According to legend, Billy Bi (billibi, bilibi, billy b, billy by) was invented in 1925 at a swanky hotel by a first class chef. It was popular from the get-go. Why then, we wonder,
is it omitted from the venerable <i>Larousse Gastronomique</i> in 1938 and 1961? Our survey of historical newspapers suggests Billy Bi surfaces in 
USA print circa 1961. This is three years after Manduit's book on Maxim's history was published. The promotion of French Cuisine, Kennedy Style made the
timing perfect. The oldest recipe we find was developed by Pierre Franey, in conjunction with Craig Claiborne, both connected with <i>The New York Times</i>.
Of course, Billy Bi was not "invented." It evolved from creamy French fish soups and classic<a href="foodlobster.html#mussels"> mussel</a> dishes. Think: Mussel Bisque and Moules Mariniere. The name of this
dish strikes us as a play on bouillabaisse but that's not how the story goes.

"... I have recorded its history, which is essentially French-American. The story goes that a wealthy American named William B. Leeds lived off and on, in Paris and
 that his favorite restaunt was Maxime's, conceivable the most celebrated restaurant in the city. The menu listed a cream of mussel soup, and this was his choice on
 almost every visit. Leeds was a reat favorite of the owner and as a result of his passion for the soup it was dubbed billi-bi, a version, of course, of Billy B."<br>

"Some have claimed that the soup was named after William Bateman Leeds, Sr. (1861-1908), president of the American Tin Plate Company, at Maxim's 
restaurant in Paris. But Jean Mauduit in his book <i>Maxim's, Soixante Ans de Plaisir et d'Histoire</i> (1958), wrote, 'The recipe was created by chef [Louis] Barthe to
 please an old regular customer who nourished an exclusive passion for mussels; the success of the dish was so great that they named it, as an honor, with the
 dimiuntive and the initial of the customer's name, even though he was not really the creator [my translation]. Mauduit gives the man's name as William Brand. The 
management of Maxim's, however, says that Barthe created the dish for Brand ('an American client of Maxim's') in 1925, but not at Maxim's; instead Barthe 
created the dish at Ciro's restaurant in Deauville."<br>

"As for the steaming hot Potage Billy-bi...it was originated in 1925 by a former Maxim's chef, Louis Barthe. He then was in the kitchen at Ciro's, a restaurant in 
Deauville, France, known for a mussels dish with a particularly succulent juice. A good customer, William Brand, invited some American friends to Ciro's one day. 
Known the French way of using fingers and a double shell for scooping out and eating mussels would be strange from his guests, he requested that the juice 
[combined with heavy cream and white wine] be served without mussels. It was such a s success, each guest returned separately and ordered Potage Billy Brand.

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Bisque</b></font><br>
Bisque first surfaces in the 17th century. Culinary evidence confirms early bisque recipes did indeed include pulverized shells of the
featured
crustacean. Bisque descended from pottage, a thick soupy mixture often consistent with puree. 
Most early
recipes call for "crayfish," which denotes what we Americans currently know as "rock lobster."
Notes <a

<p>


"Bisque is a thick rich soup, usually containing crustaceans such as lobsters, crabs, and crayfish.
The word
was originally borrowed into English from French as bisk in the mid-seventeenth century, at which
time it still
retained an early application, since lost, to  soup made from poultry or game birds, particularly
pigeons'. It is
not clear where the word came from, although some have linked it with the Spanish province of
Biscay."<br>

<p>
"Bisque. A rich soup of creamy consistency, especially of crayfish or lobster. An earlier use, for
soups of
game birds, has fallen into disusetude. Wine and/or cognac often enter into the recipes. When the
word
was first adopted from the French language, it came over as  bisk', and it thus appears in The
Accomplisht
Cook of Robert May (1685). His recipes, incidentally, illustrate the wider use of the term in his
time. He
gives two recipes for Bisk of Carp, both involving many ingredients and having plenty of solid
matter in
them. And his Bisk of Eggs sound even more surprising to modern ears."<br>

"Bisque...A seasoned shellfish puree flavoured with white wine, Cognac and double (heavy) cream, used as the basis of a soup.
The flesh of the main ingredient (crayfish, lobster or crab) is diced as for salpicon and used as a garnish. The shells
are also used to make the initial puree. The word 'bique' has been in use for centuries and suggests a connection with the
Spanish provice of Vizcaya, which lends its name to the Bay of Biscay. Bisque was originally used to decribe a highly spiced
dish of boiled meat or game. Subsequently, bisques were made using pigeons or quails and garnished with crayfish or cheese
croutes. It was not until the 17th century that crayfish became the principal ingredient of this dish, which soon after was
also prepared with other types of shellfish. The word is now used imprecisely for several pink pureed soups."<br>

Borscht is soup made mostly from <a href="foodsoups.html#beets">beets</a>. It is/was a specialty of eastern
European/Russian cuisine, primarily of the poorer people (beets were cheap). The soup dates at
least to
Medieval times.
<p>
"Borchch. A beetroot soup which can be served either hot or cold. It is essentially a dish of E.
Europe, this
region being taken to include Russia, Lithuania, Poland (where the name is barzcz) and, most
important,
the Ukraine. Ukranians count it as their national soup and firmly believe that it originated there.
They are
almost certainly right, especially if...one can properly apply to such questions the principle
followed
by
botanists: that the place where the largest number of natural variations is recorded is probably the
place of
origin of a species. There are more kinds of borshch in the Ukraine than anywhere else; these
include the
versions of Kiev, Poltava, Odessa, and L'vov. Borshch, which is also counted as a specialty of
Ashkenazi
Jewish cookery, can be made with a wide range of vegetables. However, the essential ingredient is
beetroot, giving the soup its characteristic red colour. Sour cream is usually added on top, just
before
serving..."<br>

<p>
"Beet soup or barszcz (commonly Germanized in the United States as borscht) never appeared on
the
royal table during the reign of the Jagiellonian kings, nor was it consumed by the royal servants.
Furthermore, it was not even made from beets in its original form, but from the European cow
parsnip--also
called barszcz in Polish--that grows on damp ground. Its roots were collected in May for stewing
with meat,
the shoots and young leaves were cooked as greens, and the unopened flow penduncles were
eaten as a
vegetable or added to soups and pottages. Szymon Syrennius discussed this plant in his herbal and
further
stated that soups made with it were highly valued in Poland, Lithuania, and Russia. During the
Middle Ages
it was prepared in soup by itself or was cooked in chicken stock with such additions as egg yolks,
cream, or
millet meal. The dry leaves exude a sweet substance that was used to create sweet-sour flavors,
especially
when used with vinegar. The adaptation of cow parsnips to Polish cookery appears to have come
from
Lithuania. Another wild plant called "water" barszcz...belongs to a related species...and was also used to make a similar soup, 
although it was considered best when cooked with meat...But where does this leave the beet soup we know today? Mikolaj Rej mentioned
a "broth from pickled beets" in the sixteenth century, but it was not known in all parts of Poland. The evolution of barszcz into
a recipe using sour beets is of much later date than most Poles would suspect. In fact, the well-known barszcz bialoruski
(beet soup with meat,cabbage, eggs, and sour cream) did not arrive in Poland from Russia until the nineteenth century."<br>

<b>The soup</b><br>
"Callaloo is a Caribbean term applied both to a variety of edible greens, and to a soup made from 
them. The principal recipient of the name seems to be the leaves of the taro plant, but callaloo can 
also be spinach or various members of the cabbage family. As for the soup, its principal traditional 
ingredients apart from the greens are bacon or pig's tail, crab meat, okra, and coconut milk. It is 
widely made in the Caribbean, although it is commonly regarded as a Trinidadian specialty. The 
word, which first turns up in English in the mid-eighteenth century, is of unknown origin." <br>

"Callaloo...The name of a soup made in many islands of the Caribbean, callaloo is also the name of 
the large, wide, green, leaves that go into it. One of these greens is amaranth...-either "Suriname 
amaranth"...or "Chinese spinach"...The other kind of green is the leaves of dasheen or taro...and in 
some places "sagaloo"--the leaves resemble spinach or sorrel and are cooked as a vegetable dish." <br>

"Callaloo (also known as calalou) is served in a variety of guises throughout the Caribbean. Every island's recipe, however, includes the leaves of the 
taro (dacheen) plant, also called callaloo. Callaloo soup can be made with pork, chicken, crabmeat, okra, pumpkin, yams, yuca, plantains, coconut milk, and whatever
else is in the kitchen. Sometimes it's pureed and sometimes its not."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Chicken corn soup (PA Dutch)</b></font><br> 
Our survey of PA Dutch cookbooks and American food history texts confirms the popularity of Chicken Corn Soup among Pennsylvania Dutch peoples. It appears to be a favorite during large summertime community dinners. There are several corn soup variations featuring different ingredients. Corn can be (green) fresh or (Shaker) dried. 
History texts confirm Native Americans (Eastern Woodland/Iroquois) enjoyed soups made with both fresh and dried corn. Presumably, the Pennsylvania Dutch borrowed from Native traditions to create a product similar to "Old World" 
traditions. Noodles/dumplings are signature components of German/Central European soup cuisine.

<b>What is the difference between corn soup & corn chowder? Dairy.</b><br>
"Corn soups and chowders also exploit the double blessing of green corn as both vegetable and thickener. The simplest green-corn 
soup was furnished by the Westminster Presbyterian Church Ladies of Minneapolis in Valuable Recipes (1877): "Two quarts of milk, 
ten ears of corn scraped down, season highly.' Today the same formula of liquid, scraped corn and seasoning appears in the 
sophisticated bowls of Alice Waters's Chez Panisse as 'corn soup with garlic butter,' or of Stephan Pyle's South Street Cafe as 
'grilled corn soup with ancho chile and cilantro creams.' As for chowders, corn appears in an astonishing number of them, including 
seafood and shellfish chowders of New England and the chile and tomato chowders of the Southwest." <br>
---<i>The Story of Corn</i>, Betty Fussell [North Point Press:New York] 1992 (p. 188) <br>
[NOTE: this book presents the best discussion of Native/Early American corn use, including drying methods and fresh uses.]
<p> 
"The Shakers shared with the Plain Dutch a belief in separateness from the world, in pacifism and piety, and in hard work. But 
their chief kinship likes in their attitudes toward food, in which both were ahead of their times...And in Shaker dried corn, esteemed a 
delicacy by the Pennsylvania Dutch, their memory is still alive. Made by baking fresh kernels in the sun for five days or in an 
oven for two, the dried corn is soaked in lukewarm water for twelve hours, then salted and simmered, and served with 
butter and cream. Pennsylvania Dutch housewives, many of whom make Shaker dried corn each fall, also believe that ti is better 
than fresh corn for making fritters, puddings, and the great stand-by, chicken corn soup." <br>

"I first had chicken and corn soup when visiting a Midwest farm as a youngster, but many people think one must go to the source to 
taste the real flavor of this all-American pottage. Chicken and corn soup as made in Pennsylvania is a thick combination of pungent 
buts of simmered chicken with kernels from freshly picked corn and egg noodles rolled out while the saffron-flavored broth is 
brewing; it brings tourists from far and near to Lancaster County and other parts of Pennsylvania Dutch country for church 
suppers and outdoor food festivals." <br>

William Woys Weaver, authority on PA Dutch/Philadelphia foodways, offers these elucidating observations:<br>
"Chickens Stewed With New Corn. Lea's recipe (p. 29) offers two variations of the same thing: a chicken-corn pot pie and a chicken-corn soup with dumplings. Both of these dishes are 
white adaptations of similar Native American stews. The Delaware Indians, whose historic homeland included parts of Maryland, and a highly developed stew cookery. Their 
earthenware cooking pots...were particularly well suited for stew making; and according to archaeology, the traditional 'hornets' nest' shape of these pots was developed perhaps a 
thousand years ago, but with many subsequent refinements in neck and rim design and decoration. Many eighteenth-century journals, such as those for David Brainerd and John 
Bartram, make special mention of Delaware stews combining green corn and some type of meat. Instead of chicken, however, the Indians generally used a mixture of fish and eel, dog, 
opossum, or the meat of some other small game. The natural sweetness of new corn provided a rich contrast to the meat. And like the Pennsylvania Dutch, the Indians also added a 
variety of dumplings, some made with cornmeal and nut paste, others with corn and beans tied up in small bundles, using the husks in place of dough. It is significant that in the Quaker 
counties in the immediate vicinity of Philadelphia, were a more homogenous 'English' cookery prevailed, chicken-corn soup was not widely consumed and therefore cannot be associated 
with the Anglo-Quaker element. John Witthoft and Bonita Freeman-Witthoft have pointed out in their survey of Delaware (Lenape) Indian harvest foods that many dishes like 
chicken-corn soup came into Anglo-American diet through the middle group, in this case through the Pennsylvania Dutch. Ye aside from the European substitution of chicken, the dish 
remains remarkably similar to its pre-Columbian Ancestor."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Chowder</b></font><br>
Food historians generally agree recipes dubbed "chowder," as we know them today, were named for the primative caverous 
iron pots where they originated  Think: fish/shellfish/vegetables brewing forever in ancient cauldrons, bubbling in pioneer 
American soup 
cast iron pots, economical canned goods gently simmering in aluminum pots perched on post-WWII stoves. Today's American housewives heating commercial chowders with 
microwave ovens know the taste but not the history. Perfectly understandable. 
<p>
<b>Back in the day...</b> chowder meant a any soup/stew slowly cooked in a large pot meant to feed any number of people whenever they were
hungry. There was/is no "authentic" or "original" chowder recipe. This economical dish is built from local place and taste.
Then, as now, variations (ingredients/methods/menu placement) reflected local pride and history. Soup liquid progressed from plain
water to cream/milk, pureed vegetables, spices & such. Thicknesses (& thickening agents) likewise varied. The famous <a href="http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/42/moby-dick/646/chapter-15-chowder/">chowder</a> Mrs. Hussey served to Ishmael and
 QueeQueg [<i>Moby Dick</i>/Herman Melville c. 1861] was a milk-based cod chowder.
 The most popular vegetable variation is <a href="foodsoups.html#cornchowder">corn chowder</a>.

<b>What is chowder?</b>
<br>
"A seafood soup associated with New England, the most popular of which is clam chowder. The
term may also describe a buttery, hearty soup made with corn, chicken, or other chunks of food
still evident in the blend. The origins of the word "chowder" are somewhat obscure, but most
authories, including the <i>Dictionary of American Regional English</i>, believes it derives from
the French word for a large caldron, chaudiere, in which Breton sailors threw their catch to make
a communal stew, a custom carried to Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and down to New England in
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries...The first American cookbook to give a chowder recipe
was the second edition of Amelia Simmons's <i>American Cookery</i> (1800). It called for bass,
salt pork crackers, and a side dish of potatoes...Although by 1836 "clam chowder" was known in
Boston, where its associations are still strong, throughout the century chowder was less
commonly a dish of clams than of fish, usually cod or haddock, and by the 1840s potatoes had
become a traditional ingredient...Chowder was a staple dish of New Englanders, and for sailors
merely another another way to make a constant diet of fish palatable...By the end of the century
certain New England regions became known for their various interpretations of chowder--one
might find cream in one spot, lobsters in others, no potatoes elsewhere--but most were by then a
creamy white soup brimming with chopped fish or clams, crackers, and butter..."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New
York] 1999 (p. 81-82)
<p>
<b>Which came first: milk vs tomato base? Neither.</b><br>
Oldest chowder recipes suggest they were water-based fish soups of various thickness featuring minimal underground 
vegetables (onions, carrots, later potatoes). Fish component likewise varied.
Early chowders were sometimes flavored with wine. Many incorporated a finished bread product 
(<a href="foodbreads.html#croutons">croutons</a> or 
<a href="foodcookies.html#crackers">crackers</a>), for bulk. These recipes decended from the ancient practice of combining grain with protein for maximum 
results. 
Think: pudding, porridge, gruel & soup.
<p>Dairy-based chowder versions were inevitable in cooler regions where milk animals flourished. Tomatoes and sharper 
spices made sense in warmer climes. About <a href="foodsoups.html#manhattanchowder">tomato-based fish chowders</a> (AKA Manhattan-style).

<p>
"Well before [the US Civil War], regional and even local difference had begun to appear. The earliest chowders had used only fish, onions, pork , and crackers as the main components, with wine and herbs sometimes used for flavor. As tomatoes, potatoes and milk crept into chowders, the opportunities for variety increased geometrically. Nantucket Island, saturated with seafaring ways, had the simplest chowders, for here crackers, potatoes, milk and tomatoes were all omitted. The fish, or clams, were joined with pork, onions, salt, and pepper, and thickened with flour and water...Elsewhere in New England milk began to appear in chowders. A milky appearance was given even to water-based chowders by the use of flour and water or flour and cream to thicken the stew, and this may have led Marriet Martineau to believe that a chowder she ate in 1835 at Sandy Cove, Gloucester, was made with milk. Though water remained dominant, soon small amounts of milk or cream were added just before the dish was served, and by midcentury Mrs. E. H. Putnam, a cookbook editor in Massachusetts, noted that some cooks used half milk and half water...Northern New England also increasingly left out the wine, cider, spices, curry powder, and other flavorings that had appeared in earlier recipes. Fish or shellfish, salt pork, onions, potatoes, biscuits, and water or milk became the standard ingredients, though either onions or potatoes might be completely omitted.."<br>

<b>What about the origins of tomato-based/Manhattan chowder? </b><br>
"By the 1830s in Rhode Island...cooks often added tomatoes to their chowder, a practice that
brought down unremitting scorn from chowder fanciers in Massachusetts and Maine, who
associated such a dish with New York because the dish came to be called, for no disernable
reason, "Manhattan clam chowder" sometime in the 1930s. By 1940 Eleanor Early in her <i>New
England Sampler</i> decried this "terrible pink mixture...called Manhattan Clam Chowder, that is
only a vegetable soup, and not to be confused with New England Clam Chowder, nor spoke of in
the same breath...."  Just why tomato-based chowder is called "Manhattan" has never been
satisfactorily explained..."<br>

"To say when Manhattan Clam Chowder would require a rigid definition. It may have descended from the chowders served during the late 
nineteenth century at Coney Island stands. In 1894 Charles Ranhofer, famed chef or Delmonico's restaurant, published a recipe for 'Chowder de
 Lucines,' made with pork, parsley, onions, potatoes....clams, tomatoes, and cracker, and flavored with thyme, salt and pepper. A 'Fulton Market 
Style' clam chowder of 1902 contained clams, onions, tomatoes, allspice, cloves, red pepper, and Worcestershire sauce...A 'Vegetable Clam 
Chowder' of 1929 had clams, chopped onion, diced carrots and potatoes, stewed tomatoes, and thyme. Very similar in content were two others in 
the same year, a 'Coney Island Clam Chowder' and a 'New York Clam Chowder.' All of these were certainly members of one family and were 
radically different from the New England clam chowder. The word 'Manhattan' may not have appeared on chowders until the 1930s or later....
Unwritten, too, is the history of the debate, usually conducted in terms of mock outrage, between the followers of milk-based New England clam
 chowder and those who prefer the New York version made with tomatoes and water. Early Americans would, of course, have been astounded to 
be told that either milk or tomatoes could be used."<br>

<p>
Mary Alice Cook's <i>Traditional Portuguese Recipes from Provincetown</i> contains a recipe
for milk-based fish chowder without tomatoes. She emigrated from Portugal with her family in the
early 20th century; the recipe in this book are ones from her youth. This raises the question
whether the practice of adding tomatoes in this venue was universal, or necessarily Portuguese.
<p>
"1850-1860.
Several chowder recipes using clams and tomatoes appear. Clam chowders are becoming
accepted as a suitable substitute for fish chowders, but it will be another fifty years before they
become widely popular. Tomatoes are becoming a popular food, but are used sparingly in
chowder, especially those from Cape Cod to the north. Tomatoes have not yet fallen victim to the
New England versus Manhattan rivalry; in fact, one Boston recipe from 1851 from the American
Matron includes tomatoes and milk. Milk, cream, and butter are beginning to appear in a few
recipes--an 1860 fish chowder recipe from the archives of the Shaker Museum in Old Chatham,
New York, includes two cups of cream and three tablespoons of butter...
 1900-1950
By the beginning of the twentieth century, chowder has become well established as a genre in
American cooking. The style of chowder is more brothy than its nineteenth-century predecessor;
almost all include potatoes, and crackers are served on the side. The use of salt pork or bacon
remains a constant. Regional types and preferences begin to take hold, creating rivalries, at least
in the minds of food writers...All of northern New England abhors the tomato-based chowders
from Connecticut and New York..."<br>

[NOTE: this book has an excellent chowder history timeline (p. 19-26). Ask your librarian to help
you find a copy.]
<p>
Primary evidence suggests the geographical division between New England and Manhattan (aka,
New York) clam chowder predates the 1930s...if not in name, certainly in recipe. In <i>Mrs.
Allen on Cooking, Menus, Service</i>, Ida Bailey Allen [Doubleday, Doran & Co.:Garden City
NY] 1929 one finds this recipe for New York Fish Chowder:
<blockquote>
"Observe the proportions and direction for Fish Chowder [New England], substituting for the
mixed vegetables a pint of solid canned tomatoes or a pint of fresh tomatoes cut in pieces. Season
with thyme and omit the milk." (p. 148)
</blockquote>
<p>
In the book <i>Souper Tomatoes: The Story of America's Favorite Food</i>, Andrew F. Smith
prints a recipe for  Danbury Clam Chowder,  attributed to Maria Parloa [1880] (p. 155). Danbury
is a town in southwest Connecticut. It begins "Use for six persons one quart of clams, one pint of
canned tomatoes (or one quart of fresh tomatoes), one quart of sliced potatoes, one pint of sliced
onions, one pint of water, half teaspoonful each of powdered celery seeds...one quarter of a
pound of salt pork, one teaspoonful of pepper, and three teaspoonfuls of salt.
<p>
"Whether brewed in a ship's galley or on the home stove, mention of clam chowder has spurred
debates for generations. Real Yankees think of chowder as a whole meal by itself, and some feel
so strongly about the ingredients that a Maine legislator named Seeder finally, in 1939,
introduced a bill to make it illegal to add tomatoes to the pot. Long Islanders, and other defenders
of the so-called Manhattan clam chowder point out that their version should be served as a soup
source, for them fresh tomatoes have been the source of necessary flavor and color, since Long
Island tomato growers and some neighborly old salts were mutually persuasive about merging
fruits of the garden and the sea. Marylanders, down on Chesapeake Bay, want no part of the
tomatoes-or-not brouhaha. Early cooks of the region often combined chicken, vegetables, and
seafood..."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Cioppino</b></font><br>
The history of cioppino illustrates some very interesting (and important!) points for culinary
researchers. It presents an excellent example of a recipe commonly percieved as being "invented,"
and therefore, traceable to an exact place, people and time. Truth is? Recipes aren't "invented,"
they evolve according to custom and cuisine. The true story of cioppino begins with ancient
mediterranean fishermen who concocted the first fish soups and stews. These recipes were
adopted by all seafaring cultures; recipes resulted according to local  ingredients. Cioppino
belongs to the same tradition as chowder and bouillabaise.
<p>
American cioppino is a story of immigration patterns, ethnic heritage, and local adaptation.
<p>
Food historians generally agree cioppino originated in California (most often cited San Francisco
Bay area). The group of Italians credited for the recipe immigrated from Northern Italy,
specifically Genoa. A <a href="foodsoups.html#cioppinorecipes">1915 recipe</a> we have dubbs it "Neapolitan." The fish? Depended upon the catch of the day. In the cold waters of the San
Francisco Bay, [Dungeness] crabs were plentiful and often included. Presumably, in Genoa this
stew was made in the same fashion, with the local catch of the day.
<p>
"The only thing definate about cioppino is that no one knows for sure when it originated. In
researching the recipe, I found a wide range of dates--from Gold Rush Days to the 1930s. Most
food historians and cookbook authors don't even try to fix the recipe in time, although all point to
San Francisco as the place of origin. It's true, certainly, that cioppino wasn't well known beyond
the Bay area (or at least outside California) until after World War II.
     John Thorne...describes in the September/October 1996 issue of his newsletter, <i>Simple
Cooking</i>, how he came upon a vintage (1921) cookbook that discusses cioppino in detail.
That book, <i>Fish Cookery</i>, by Evelyn Spencer of the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries and John N.
Cobb, director of the College of Fisheries at the University of Washington, offers a recipe for
cioppino that had appeared three years earlier by H.B. Nidever in California Fish and Game. Thorne believes that it may be one of the first, if not the first, ever published. He also points
to...[a]... passage in Nidever's article, which suggests that cioppino originated in the fishing
grounds off the coast of California, not San Francisco...Yet according to Coleman
Andrews...there is a classic Genoese fisherman's soup called il ciuppin. Its name....is "simply a
corruption of the Genoise word suppin, meaning  little soup'....<br>

"Cioppino. A fish stew cooked with tomatoes, wine, and spices, and associated at least since the
1930s with San Francisco, where it is still a specialty in many restaurants (1935). The word is
Italian, from a Genoese dialect, ciuppin, for a fish stew, and the dish seems to have originated
with the Italian immigrants of San Francisco, who often used the crabmeat available in the city's
markets."<br>

"Bernsteins, until recently a Powell Street landmark, opened its doors for the first time soon after
the [1906] earthquake. From its inception the restaurant kept cioppino, the famous San Francisco
fish stew, on the menu. Early in this century, more than one hundred and nine varieties of fish
were taken from San Francisco Bay and sold commercially by the fishermen who hailed mainly
from Genoa...A great treat rarely savored today is cioppino cooked on the small boats while at
sea, with the catch prepared immediately after having been scooped from the cold waters. In that
more leisurely era, this was a feast that was regularly enjoyed. Cioppino remains on the menus of
most of the city's fine fish restaurants, and its variety of ingredients is infinite."<br>

"Cioppino.</b> This is one of California's most famous dishes, and one that we can claim is ours, all
ours. It is a versatile dish, as it was invented by fishermen who made it with whatever the ocean
was inclined to yield, so of course there are dozens of ideas on how it should be done. Exponents
of the various schools of cookery get quite fussed--and fussy--about how to make cioppino. Red
or white wine, or sherry? Shrimp and crab, clams, or just a mixture of fish? The best way is as you
like it. This recipe is for a combination of fish, but it's basic enough to be used with lobster alone,
or with crab, or with practically anything that comes from the sea.<br><blockquote>
You'll need 1 1/2 pounds of firm-fleshed fish--shark is good, and so is sea bass or rockfish. Also
1/2 pounds of green shrimps, a large crab, and a dozen medium-sized clams or cockles, or
mussels, or oysters. Have the fish cut in good-sized pieces, the shrimps shelled and their black
veins removed, and the crab cleaned, and the body cut in pieces, shell and all, the legs cracked for
easier later picking, the clams well scrubbed and left in their shells. Now make a sauce: cook
together 1/2 cup of olive oil, a teaspoon of minced garlic (more if you're a garlic fiend), a cup of
chopped onions, a cupt of chopped green onions, 1/2 cup of minced green pepper, an 8-ounce tin
of tomato sauce, a No. 2 1/2 can of tomatoes, 2 cups of red table wine, 1/4 cup of minced parsley,
a teaspoon of salt, 1/4 teaspoon of coarsely ground pepper, 1/4 teaspoon each of oregano and
basil. Cook 5 minutes. Now arrange the fish, crab, and shrimps in layers in a big casserole or pot,
pour over the sauce, cover, and cook on a low flame or in the oven for 30 minutes, or until the
fish is done. Add the clams, or whatever mollusks you have chosen, and, as soon as they open up,
sprinkle the whole with another 1/4 cup of minced parsley , and serve forth in the casserole or in a
tureen, with oodles of hot garlic bread. Bibs are in order, too. Serves 6 to 8...</blockquote><br>
NOTE: I have been told, and on good authority, too, that the Portuguese fishermen always
thicken their cioppino sauce with a potato or two, and that they use much more garlic than is in
this recipe.<br>
NOTE: One story says that San Francisco's fishermen did not introduce cioppino to California,
but that an Italian named Bazzuro, who ran a restaurant on a boat anchored off  Fisherman's warf,
is responsible. What's more, it was supposed to have been an older ecipe, well known in Italy.

back in the 1850s. I refuse to believe it!"<br>

  "Cock-a-leekie. This sustaining broth of chicken and leeks is firmly associated with
  Scotland, although something similar appears in other parts of Britain, and indeed of
  Europe. In its earliest medieval versions, it was a chicken stew with onions, and also
  raisins or prunes. The chicken would often have been eaten separately, and the stewing
  liquor drunk as soup. Adapated to Scottish conditions, leeks replaced onions, and by the
  nineteenth century the prunes seem to have disappeared, leaving the cock-a-leekie (or, in

  chicken and the broth. Modern recipes are generally for just one dish not two; they
  provide for cutting up the chicken meat before the soup is served; and they are virtually
  unanimous in insisting that chicken and leeks between them provide plenty of solid
  matter. Onions have retained their place in the recipes, but raisins have largely

  have been this dish at a knight's house there.  But the 'upper mess', he reported,  'instead
  of porridge, had a pullet with some prunes in the broth.' The recipe stemmed, in all

  broth with ground almonds, currants, raisins, dates, prunes, sugar, spice and sack...But by
  Georgian times such compositions had lost their appeal and were rarely eaten. There were
  one or two notable exceptions. Cock-a-leekie still survived in Scotland. Lady Grisill
  Baillie in 1743 wrote a special instruction to her housekeeper to use a measured six
  ounces of prunes in its making. Mrs. Margaret Dods affirmed in 1826 that  'the soup

"Consomme, meaning a clear soup, has been used in English since the early part of the 19th
century, but
has been a French culinary term since the 16th century. It is the past participle of the verb
consommer,
meaning to consume or accomplish or finish, and indicating in this context a finished soup as
opposed to a
simple stock or broth. Double consomme is a clarified consomme. Little fragments of this or that
may be
introduced into a consomme at some stage in its production, or just when serving, and the nature
of these
is, in classical French cookery, reflected in the name give to the consomme...A consomme may be
served
hot or cold, usually at the beginning of the meal. The simplest consomme of all, in France, is the
broth
(bouillon) from Pot-au-feu."<br>

"Consumme. In French, consomme is literally something that has been  consummated- that is, by
boiling
down, the flavours of meat, vegetables, or whatever have become completely
concentrated...Originally, the
word seems to have been applied to any rich broth which was the product of long, slow cooking;
but by the
mid-nineteenth century the current signification  'clear soup' was well established. One of the
earliest
references to consomme in English is by Bryon, who in <i>Don Juan</i> (1824) laments  Alas! I

Onions, and onion soup were enjoyed by ancient Roman and Greek peoples. French onion soup
(with the
bread and cheese topping) is reminicent of Medieval <a href="foodsoups.html#sops">sops</a>. The recipe we
know today 
is a direct descendant of modern French bouillon crafted in the 17th century. Onion soups are
likewise
found in early English cookbooks and American cookbooks from colonial days to present.
Curiously, it is
absent from Escoffier's <i>Guide Culinaire</i> [1903]. Onion soup enjoyed a resurgence of
popularity in the
1960s, when French cooking was promoted in the United States. 
<p>
<b>Why onions?</b><br>
Onions were common in the Old World and were used in many recipes: boiled, baked, and fried.
For many
centuries they were considered food of the poorer people. Onions were  also thought to have
restorative
powers, making them a perfect choice for soup.  It is interesting to note that early peoples
thought eating raw
onions
caused headaches.

"Your Own French Onion Soup.<br>
Soupe a l'oignon, a large bowl of it bubbling under a brown crust of cheese, is practically a meal
in itself.
Serve it after a football game, as a Sunday-night supper, or as a midnight snack. Its rich aroma, its
wonderful flavor and savor, have made French onion soup a world favorite. Here are directions
for brewing
your own...
<p>
Soupe A L'Oignon, Maison<br>
For 6 to 8 servings<br>
Onion soup is simply a large quantity of sliced onions slowly cooked and browned in butter, then
simmered
in beef bouillon. To achieve the true homemade taste, you'll need a homemade bouillon--beef
bones and
shank meat simmered for several hours with the usual carrots, onions, celery, seasonings, and
herbs. If
your own bouillon is lacking, substitute canned beef bouillon.<br
A heavy 4-quart saucepan or casserole<br>
2 Tb butter

1 Tb olive oil or cooking oil<br>
About 1 1/2 lbs or 5 to 6 cups thinly sliced yellow onions<br>
1 tsp salt<br>
1/2  tsp sugar<br>
3 Tb flour<br>
2 quarts hot beef bouillon (you may dilute canned bouillon with 2 cups of water)<br>
1 cup red or white wine<br>
1 bay leaf<br>
1/2 tsp sage<br>
Salt and pepper to taste<p>
Melt the butter with the oil in the saucepan or casserole; add the sliced onions and stir up to coat
with the butter. Cover the pan and cook over moderately low heat for 15-20 minutes, stirring
occasionally, until onions are tender and translucent. The uncover the pan, raise heat to
moderately high, and stir in the salt and sugar. (Sugar, by caramelizing, helps onions to brown.)
Cook for about 30 minutes, stirring frequently, until onions have turned an even deep golden
brown. The lower heat to moderate, stir in the flour, and add a bit more butter if flour does not
absorb into a paste with the onions. Cook slowly, stirring continually, for about 2 mintues to
brown the flour lightly. Remove from heat. Pour in about a cup of the hot bouillon, stirring with a
wire whip to blend flour and bouillon. Add the rest of the bouillon and the wine, bay, and sage,
and bring to the simmer. Simmer slowly for 30-40 minutes, season to taste with salt and pepper,
and the soup is done. If you are not serving immediately, let cool uncovered, then cover and
refrigerate. Serve with French Bread and grated Parmesan cheese, or bake with cheese as follows.
<p>
Soup a l'Oignon Gratinee<br>
This turns onion soup into a hearty main course...You may prepare all the elements for this ahead
of time, but once the soup is assembled in its casserole, you should proceed with the recipe or the
bread may sink to the bottom of the dish. (Note: you will need a chewey homemade type of
bread...)<br>
A loaf of French bread<br>
Olive oil or melted butter<br>
The preceding soup, brought to the simmer<br>
Optional: 1/4 cup cognac<br>
A peeled 2-inch raw onion<br>
A 2-ounce piece Swiss cheese<br>
1 1/2  cups grated Swiss and Parmesean cheese, mixed<br>
Cut the bread into slices 1 inch thick, paint lightly with oil or butter and arrange in one layer on a
baking sheet. Place in middle level of a preheated 325-degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes until
beginning to brown lightly; turn and brown lightly for 15 to 20 minutes on the other side. These
are called croutes. Pour the hot soup into a serving casserole or baking dish. Pour in the optional
cognac, grate in the onion, and shave the piece of cheese into fine slivers and strew over the soup.
Place a closely packed layer of croutes over the top of the soup and spread on the grated cheese,
covering the croutes completely. Sprinkle a tablespoon of oil or butter over the cheese, and set
the soup in the middle level of a preheated 350-degree oven. Bake for about 30 minutes, or until
soup is bubbling slowly and cheese has melted. Meanwhile, heat up our broiler to red hot; just
before serving run the soup under the hot broiler for a moment to brown the cheese lightly. Pass
remaining croutes in a bread tray along with the soup."<br>

Soup for dessert? Certainly! <a href="foodsoups.html#coldsoup">Chilled soups</a> play key roles in northern European cuisine.  
Think: fruit custard deconstructed. Hot fruit soups also exist. Traditionally composed with dried fruits, these
dishes predominate holiday tables.
<P>
  "Fruit soups. Especially popular in Germany and Nordic countries, are something of an anomaly.
  The category of soup is one of almost exclusively savoury dishes. Fruit soups, however, although
  they may be served at the beginning of a meal, are essentially sweet dishes. They may be thin
  and delicate or thickened and substantial. Riley M. Fletcher Berry...made interesting comments
  about this distinction. He observed that, for the prosperous readers whom he was addressing, fruit
  soups would be served in very small glass or china bowls or bouillon cups; very delicate.
  However, he admonished these same prosperous readers, one should not forget that fruit soups
  'are foods and as such are used in many countries by even the peasants, though they may lack
  dainty table appointments'. One outstanding example of a dish which occurs on both sides of the
  dividing line, but predominately as a 'solid' moulded dessert dish is kisel. It is quite closely related
  to another, which is more commonly met in liquid or near-liquid form; this is rodgrot, the red berry
  soup popular in Denmark and other parts of Scandinavia...which may the thickened with semolina
  but remains a soup rather than a moulded dessert. Other fruits commonly used to make soups
  include cherries and apple, also gooseberries or blueberries, rose-hips, rhubarb, and even
  lemon."<br>

  "If chilled sweet orange soup strikes you as strange or unusual, you may be "desserting" a
  sweet and lucrative menu opportunity. Soups can do more than whet your palate for the
  main course; dessert soups may wake up tired taste buds after a long meal of four or five
  savory courses. And some chefs find guests may even indulge in two desserts, if the first
  is a light fruit soup. Pastry chef Jacques Torres of Le Cirque, for example, says his
  dessert soups are often a precursor to the main event. Torres prepares a citrus-sugar broth
  in which he floats diced seasonal fruit and a scoop of sorbet. In the summer cold fruit
  soups reign. And for pastry chefs who prefer the taste of uncooked fruits to cooked ones,
  dessert soups work extraordinarily well; they highlight raw fruit in an unusual context,
  making guests feel as though they are getting something special. Jean-Georges
  Vongerichten says dessert soups sell well at his Manhattan restaurants, Vong and Jo Jo
  because the dishes are not typically found in bakeries, pastry shops or in a home cook's
  repertoire. He calls the soups a restaurant "kitchen" dessert. "I always have different
  dessert soups on the menu. They are very refreshing," Vongerichten says. "When you go
  out to restaurants four or five times a week, you want something refreshing," he adds. "It
  is nice to finish with this kind of dessert, especially for lunch." <br>

Food historians confirm both soup and garlic have been consumed by humans from prehistoric times forward. Garlic has enjoyed a long and complicated history as
 legendary substance, earthly spice, digestible vegetable, and curious cure. Soup plots the culinary map from basest nutritional substance to finest gourmet 
achievement.

<b>About garlic soup</b><br>
"Soupe Aigo Bouido a la Menagere (Provence) [Housewife-style Garlic Soup] The ordinary housewife in the Middle Ages would hardly have used exotic spices
 of the East in her soups, but she did have garlic. Garlic and onions were so abundant in the local Provencal horta (garden) that they were usually the only two
 products that got transported any distance. The other ortolagia, the vegetables products of the garden, were consumed locally. Garlic was indispensable for aigo 
bouido. Oil and water or water and bread soups are very old preparations once made by the housewives of Provence. Another simple Provincal 'housewife' soup 
is called aigo-sau d'iou, 'water and salt,' a fish soup made with water and salt, plus a mixture of small white fish, onions, potatoes, tomatoes, garlic, herbs, and olive 
oil. These soups remind us of how poor the Mediterranean was...These poor 'family' soups are usually very simple...The aromatic flavoring came from the
 ubiquitous garlic as well as herbs. In the Gerona region of Catalonia, a family would eat a sopa de la familia, family soup, made from potatoes, bread, and garlic.
 Don't expect to find any of these soups on a restaurant menu...They are antique dishes rarely made even in the home now that a pervasive Mediterranean
 poverty is a thing of the past. But these kinds of soups are notable for being filling, economical, and delicious...Soupe a l'Ail (Languedoc) [Garlic Soup] In his study
 of the roots of the cuisine in Provence, the French historian Louis Stouff asks whether there was an original Provincal cuisine. The question is hard to answer 
because, although one can detect a certain prevalent taste--for example, for olive oil and herbs--we unfortunately cannot deduce much from that because it is
 equally a description of other Mediterranean cuisines. But in Languedoc and Provence, garlic, although thought of as a vegetable, was used as a spice and appears 
in everything, such as sauces often made of eggs, garlic, and almonds. Pepper was expensive and when it appeared, it was usually on the table of a noble family or 
for special occasions, such as this heavily peppered soup that consummates the rite of marriage in traditional ceremonies in Languedoc. The copious use of both 
garlic and black pepper in this soup that the wife presents to her new husband on their first day as a couple must be a metaphor for the lives ahead of them and the
 hope that it will be spiritually, if not materially, rich. This opulent-tasting soup (a result of the eggs) needs hard-toasted bread and lots of pepper."<br>
---<i>A Mediterranean Feast</i>, Clifford A. Wright [William Morrow:New York] 1999 (p. 512-513) [NOTE: Recipes for both of these soups are included in this book. We can scan or fax if you like. If you need more details regarding the use of garlic in Mediterranean cuisine we encourage you to ask your local public librarian to help you get a copy of this book. It is excellent!] 
<p>
<b>Provencal culinary heritage</b><br>
"Provencale (a la) describes certain preparations characterized by the use of tomato and garlic mixed, and sometimes garlic alone....Garlic is the base of almost all 
the Provencal dishes, but it must be remembered that the Midi garlic has not such a strong taste or such a bitter flavor as that of the northern districts...

Languedocienne, but also subtly flavoured and delicate appetizers such as the magnificent pate de foi gras with truffles, gem of the Languedoc culinary repertoire...
In Langedoc, the Roman and Arab influence which gradually determined the character of its cooking are still recognizable...With such natural resources, it is no

<a name="gazpacho">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Gazpacho</b></font><br>
Food historians generally agree that gazpacho, as we Americans know it today, is a Spanish
recipe. Why?
The word evolved from Arabic roots. Spain (Andalusia, more specifically) was invaded by the
Moors in the Middle Ages. As a result, much of that region's gastronomy was greatly affected by
Middle Eastern recipes and ingredients. Italian cuisine, though sharing many of the same foods as
that of Spain, evolved differently. The earliest gazpacho type recipes (soup-salad) date to the
middle ages, long before tomatoes were known in the Old World. When the Spanish came to the
New World they brought with them hundreds of years of culinary traditions. Many of these
recipes, including those for soups and stews, readily embraced new ingredients, including  <a
href="foodsauces.html#tomato">tomatoes</a>. 
<p>
Interestingly enough, gazpacho-type recipes were introduced to North America via Europe by
Spanish missionaries, English colonists, French settlers, Italian Immigrants, and others. In the old
world "In the Spanish style" often simply meant with tomatoes.
<p>
"Gazpacho is a Spanish vegetable soup whos chief characteristic is that it is served ice-cold. Its
main ingredients are tomatoes, peppers, onions, cucumber, olive oil, and usually breadcrumbs, but
there are many additional regional variations within Spain. It is traditionally cooked in a large clay
bowl, and brought to the table with garlic croutons and small bowls of raw vegetables. Its name is
of Arabic origin, and means literally  soaked bread'."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 139)
<p>
"Gazpacho, a Spanish term whose meaning had evolved over the centuries. It is now most familiar
in the form of Andalusian gazpacho, which is typically a cold soup with various vegetable
ingredients, notably garlic, tomato, and cucumber. However, a gazpacho may be served hot
during the winter; and in its original form, derived from the Arabs who occupied much of Spain
from the 8th to the 13th centuries, the essential ingredients were bread, garlic, olive oil, vinegar,
salt, and water. These ingredients were pounded in a mortar, and the result was very similar to
Ajo blanco (ajo meaning barlic and blanco meaning white) or Sopa de ajo (garlic soup), two other
ancient dishes which have survived into modern times...Vinegar is important for the refreshing
qualities of those gazpachos that are particularly associated with warm weather; and it provides a
link to Roman culture, as it was the Romans who popularized throughout their empire the use of
vinegar for refreshment purposes...The internationally famous Andalusian gazpacho...is said to
have been introduced to France by Eugenia de Montijo of Granada, the wife of the Emperor
Napoleon III...Ingredients from the New World, notably tomato, were not incorporated into
gazpachos until comparatively recent times. Thus the recipe for gazpacho given by Juan de la
Mata (Arte de reposteria, 1747) had none of these  new' ingredients."<br>

"Before the first tomato soup recipe was published, tomatoes were used as ingredients
in soups with altenative names. The first located recipes calling for tomatoes insoups
were published in Mary Randolph's Virginia Housewife (Washington, 1824). Randolph
featured tomatoes in recipes for veal, barley, and okra soups. It is also surprising to
note that Randolph published the first known recipe for gazpacho. How the recipe for
this traditional Spanish soup, whose name is from an Arabic meaning literally "soaked
bread," could first be published in the United States relates to who wrote cookbooks in
Spain and Randolph's relatives. In Spain gazpacho was considered a peasant soup.
Consequently, recipes for it were not published in early Spanish cookbooks, which
were written mainly for the upper middle class. As culinary historian Karen Hess has
noted, Mary Randolph probably acquired her Spanish recipes from her sister, Harriet
Randolph Hackley, who had lived in Cadiz, Spain. It is also interesting to note that the
second and third known published recipes for gazpacho were also not published in
Spain. Novisimo arte de cocina (Philadephia, 1845), the first located Spanish-language
cookbook published in the United States, featured eight-eight tomato recipes, including
two for gazpacho. This cookbooks was printed on a sterotype press for a client in
Mexico and was probably not distributed in the United States. It has little influence on
mainstream American cookery. While several cookbook authors published similar
recipes under the name of Andalusian soup, the term gazpacho died out in America
until the late twentieth century."<br>

<a name="goulash">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Goulash</b></font><br>
Food historians trace the genesis of Goulash (gulyas), a thick soup/stew, to 9th century Hungarian shepherds. In fact? the term
"Gulyas" literally translates as "herdsmen." Soup played a key role in the early pastoral diet. Dried meats and vegetables were
eminently portable and easily reconstuted. Over the years, Hungarian Goulash evolved from peasant fare to signature national
dish. Interpretations, especially in the <a href="foodsoups.html#americangoulash">USA</a>, range from somewhat authentic to amalgamated leftovers 
whose only claim to
Hungary is a generous helping of paprika. It is interesting to note that <a href="foodsoups.html#paprika">paprika</a>, the spice 
that has become almost synonymous with Hungary, was probably not introduced until the 16th century. By the 19th century it
was percieved globally as THE key ingredient in Hungarian cuisine.   
<p>
"In the ninth-and tenth-century pre-Christian Hungarian cuisine, the most important element was the soup, and its importance has not
waned since, except in the Middle Ages. An overhwelming number of the soups had a sour or semi-sour taste, achieved by whipping in sour 
cream, vinegar, yogurt, horseradish and sauerkraut. Other soups they thickened with a mixture of flour, milk and egg yolk or the browned flour and fat mixture
still basic to many Hungarian dishes."<br>
---<i>The Cuisine of Hungary</i>, George Lang [Atheneum:New York] 1982 (p. 5)
<p>
"The four pillars of Hungarian cooking are gulyas, porkolt, paprikas and tokany. Gulyas. A strange thing has happened to
Hungarian gulyas. According to a 1969 Gallup Poll, gulyas is one of the five most popular meat dishes on the American cooking
scene. Of course, what is usually served under this name shouldn't happen to a Rumanian. The origin of the soup...can be traced
back to the ninth century--shepherds cut their meat into cubes, cooked it with onion in a heavy iron kettle (bogracs) and
slowly stewed the dish until all the liquid evaporated. They dried the remnants in the sun (probably on their sheepskin capes), 
and then put the dried food in a bag made of the sheep's stomach. Whenever they wanted food, they took out a piece of the fired meat,
added some water and reheated it. With a lot of liquid, it became a gulyas soup...if less liquid was added, it became
culyas meat...Even today this distinction exists, probably to mystify foreigners and foreign cookbook writers. The more parts of 
beef and beef innards are used, the better the gulyas will be. Of course, lard and bacon (either or both) are chopped
onion are absolute musts...Never use any flour. Never use any other spice besides caraway. Never Frenchify it with wine. Never
Germanize it with brown sauce. Never put in any other garniture besides diced potatoes or galuska. But many variations are possible--
you may use fresh tomatoes or tomato puree, garlic, sliced green peppers, hot cherry peppers to make it very spicy, and so on. 
An interesting technique was suttested by Mrs. Mariska Vizvary and originally published in the 1930's. She added grated
raw potatos in the very beginning, presumable to give body to the soup, and she cooked bones and vegetables separately to
make a strong broth with which to strengthen the gulyas soup at the very end."<br>
---<i>The Cuisine of Hungary</i> (p. 270-1)

<p>
"Goulash. This rich Hungarian meat stew seems not to have impinged on the British consciousness until the middle of the nineteenth century (it is first quoted in English
 in a letter from the Crown Princess of Prussia, 1866). The classic goulash is made of beef (or veal or pork or lamb) with of onions--generally the same among or 
onions as meat--bulked out with potatoes and seasoned generously with paprika. (Sour cream is not authentic, but has been transferred to goulash from other 
Hungarian paprika dishes in Western cuisine.). In Hungarian, guylas means literally 'herdsman', and the term goulash represents an abbreviation of gulyashus
 'herdsmans' meat'."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 146)
<p>
"Goulash. Probably the best known, outside of Hungary, of Hungarian dishes...'What is goulash?' In Hungary, the word 'goulash' today refers to the cattle driver,
 the 'cowboy'. The only place on a Hungarian menu where you will find goulash (gulyas, as it is written in Hungarian) would be among the soups, and it would be
 called gulyas leves, meaning 'the soup of the cowboy'. What is known all over the world as 'Hungarian goulash' is called in Hungary porkolt or paprikas. Porkolt 
contains no sour cream. It is called paprikas if sour cream has been added to the porkolt...The dish of goulash is in fact relatively new under either of its names. 
Hungarian cattlemen, shepherds, and pigherders cooked cubed meat with onion and spices...for at least 300 to 500 years. But the dish could not be called porkolt 
or paprikas because this spice, paprika, today considered the most Hungarian of all spices, is realteive new to the Hungarian cuisine. It was not known in Hungary
 until the 1820s when it became extremely popular and practically eliminated black pepper and ginger from the average Hungarian kitchen...In the middle of the
 19th cetnury, the new dish, porkolt, became as popular as chicken, veal, or pork similarly prepared with paprika. Because these had been holiday dishes served
 on special occasion to guests, they spread much faster than more commonplace dishes. Because visitors from Austria, Bohemia, Poland, and Switzerland were 
treated as honoured gusests and had been feted with porkolt or paprikas, those dishes found their way quickly into the cookbooks and restaurants of the 
neighbouring countries. What does this all have to do with 'goulash'? The difference between the Hungarian porkolt, known all over the world except in Hungary
 as 'goulash', and goulash soup, is in the, is in the amount of liquid added to the meat, and whether pasta or potatoes are included. In the real Hungarian porkolt or
 paprikas...there are no other ingredients except beef, pork, veal, or chicken, shortening...paprika, onions, and once in a while selected herbs, spices, or condiments.
 'Goulash' became so popular in N. America that many American cookery books list  as an integral part of American cusisine such items as 'Hungarian goulash,' ..."<br>

<b>Paprika derives from <a href="foodmexican.html#chile">New World chile peppers</a>. About paprika & Hungarian cuisine:</b>
<p>
  "There is something about paprika itself that makes it synonymous with "Hungarian."
  "Fiery," "spicy," temperamental"--all these adjectives suggest both paprika and the
  Hungarian national character. Paprika is to the Hungarian cuisine as it is to
  conversation--not just a superficial garnish, but an integral element, a very special and
  unique flavor instantly recognizable. The transformation of paprika into this vital element
  of Hungarian cuisine is a cuirous and fascinating story. Like the meeting of two people
  who seemed fated to fall in love, the marriage of paprika and Hungarian cooking was
  almost predestined. Where did paprika come from? There are many hypotheses...It came
  from the slopes of the Himalayas...Columbus brought it to Europe from America...it came
  from Central Africa...the Greek gods first used it for snuff on Mount Olympus...it came
  from India...It the first century A.D., Nero's celebrated personal physician, Dioscorides,
  in his famous De Materia Medica, described a piper longum rotundum--which sounds
  astonishingly like paprika. Was it paprika, or something similar? We shall probably never
  know for certain, as there was no record of it after that until Columbus' momentous
  voyage to the New World. The first written record of paprika as we know it appears in
  letters that Chanca, Columbus' ship surgeon, wrote to his friend Hernandex, court
  surgeon to King Philip of Spain. Chanca described "Indian pepper" growing in the New
  World as a "very attractive, ornamental plant which may prove medically useful." He
  mentioned, offhandedly, that the natives used this Indian pepper as a condiment....by the
  end of the sixteenth century a flourishing paprika culture had grown up in the Iberian
  peninusula...this is the time to mention that several learned authorities, including Karoly
  Grundel, felt that the Spanish pimiento paprika indeed came from Spain via Columbus,
  but that the Hungarian capsium paprika arrived in Hungary from India via Persia, and was 
  brought in by the Turks at the beginning of the sixteenth century. The main support for
  this "India" theory is simply that just about everybody called paprika "Indian pepper" for
  several hundred years...Amid this...conflicting evidence, we are sure of only one thing:
  before Columbus, paprika was unknown in Europe...After the Italians introduced paprika
  to their country (from Spain), the Turks, who had many contacts with the Italians, took
  the seeds from Italy to the Balkans, then part of the vast Ottoman domain. In the sixteenth
  century the Turkish Empire included Bulgaria as well as most of Hungary in its realm. The
  Bulgarians, known as the "gardeners of Europe," have always been famous for being
  able to make almost anything bloom. Having learned to cultivate paprika from the seeds
  given them by the Turks, many Bulgarian gardeners emigrated to Hungary during the
  sixteenth century, partly attracted by the far more favorable soil and climate, and partly
  fleeing the Turks...There is ample evidence that the Bulgarians brought paprika to
  Hungary and started its cultivation...When a Hungarian says "paprika," it means only the
  ground spice...In Hungary there are two basic categories of paprika: first, those grown for
  eating fresh, cooked or marinated; and second, those destined to be dried, ground into
  powder and used as a condiment...As paprika growing took hold toward the end of the
  sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeeth century, the red pod began to be widely
  used as a spice. Shepherds added it to their kettle gulyas..., fishermen to their fish
  stew...Townspeople sprinkled their bacon with paprika...and added it to a variety of
  dishes, mixing it with sour cream. The landed gentry were slower to realize its virtues. At
  last, they, too, recognized that not only was paprika cheaper than black pepper, but it also 
  stimulated the appetite and had a most delightful character of its own...Hungary was
  unquestionably the first to use powdered paprika in pure form, unmixed with anything
  else...In its slow climb to acceptance as a national treasure, paprika rose from the lowest
  classes, through the broad masses of peasants and fishermen, to the townspeople and
  gentry. The nobility was the very last to acknowledge paprika, probably because it did not
  stem from aristocratic tradition. Eighteenth century records are full of recipes for pate
  made with turtle meat or pheasant cooked with crayfish, and other rare delicacies. But not
  till 1844 did Paprikas Chicken appear on a menu of the National Casino, the exclusive
  club of the Hungarian House of Lords. The fact that it was a favorite dish of the beautiful
  and popular Queen Elizabeth (Franz Josef I's consort), who often visited Hungary, from
  1860 until her assassination, probably won over the Hungarian aristocracy finally. A
  queen couldn't be wrong! Paprika's victory was complete. In shaping the cuisine of
  Hungary, it was itself transformed. It had now become utterly Hungarian. No less a
  personage than Escoffier himself introduced paprika to the grand cuisine of France.
  Escoffier brought it from Szeged, and served it in Monte Carlo in 1879, in Gulyas
  Hongrois and Poulet au Paprika...But the very first time paprika turned up in a recipe in a
  printed cookbook was much earlier--in 1817. Printed in Vienna, the cookbook was the
  work of one F.G. Zenker, chef of Prince Schwarsenberg. He listed paprika in his recipe
  for Chicken Fricassee in Indian Style...The earliest of "modern" Hungarian
  cookbooks...was probably Istvan Czifrai's...The first edition was published in the early
  1820s. But it was not until the third edition (1829) that paprika appeared in two famous
  and characteristic Hungarian dishes...the other notable "first" is the paprikas csirke
  (Paprikas Chicken), which became one of the most popular dishes not only in Hungary,
  but the whole world. Here...the actual recipe as...appeared:
  <br><blockquote>
  <b>Paprikas chicken</b><br>
  "Take two or more chickens and cut them up into pieces. Melt a piece of lard in a copper
  pot. Put in paprika, clove and onion and cook slowly. The add the chicken pieces, pour a
  little meat broth over them, and begin cooking. Sprinkle with a spoonful of flour, add
  sour cream and sprinkle with paprika. Cook a little longer and then serve."</blockquote><br>

Goulash is best when prepared from different parts of the beef. One may take the rump, loin, some of the heart, kidney, and also the 
neck. Cut them all into square pieces, wash well, put into a steam-kettle, and pour enough water over it to cover it completely.
When it reached boiling point, add sliced onions, salt, and pepper, stir up well a couple of times and let it boil until the gravy has
cooked away into the fat. Serve the goulash in the center of a  dish and circle with spaetzels or egg barley. It is quite original
to serve it in the kettle. Goulash has to cook for quite 3 hours to become tender. Prepare the spaetzels from plain kneaded dough. When
kneaded, roll out about 1/2 inch thick, cut into long slices, tear the slices into small pieces (about the size of a peanut), round, 
then cook in salted water. Drain off the water, put some fat over them and mix in with the goulash and boil with that."<br>

Hodge Podge (aka hotpot, hotchpotch, hutspot; presenting as one word, hyphonated phrase or two words) descends from Medieval slow food, most notably stews. These are complex
dishes requiring time and bountiful ingredients. <a href="foodsoups.html#ollapodrida">Olla Podrida</a> (aka Olio) is the most complicated
version. Recipes with this title first surface in 17th century Europe. Early recipes reflect Medieval/Renaissance flavors.
19th century formulae would appeal to modern tastes. Hodge podge was introduced to the New World by European settlers. Most notably? Those 
originating from the British Isles and the Netherlands. 
<p>
<b>What is Hodge Podge?</b><br>
"Hotpot. A word having different applications in the western and eastern hemispheres...In the 
west it is usually Lancashire hotpot, a dish of NW England and in particular of Lancashire. The 
main ingredients are lamb or mutton chops and potatoes, and the cooking is done slowly in a 
covered pot of casserole. A Lancashire hotpot dish is tall, round, straight sided, and has a lid. The 
dish is filled with layers of browned lamb mutton chops and layers of onions and thickly sliced 
potatoes. Other ingredients sometimes added are kidneys and black puddings; oysters, when 
cheap, were also included. The top layer is always an arrangement of overlapping potato slices, 
sometimes surrounding small circles made from the rounded ends of the potatoes. Stock is added 
and the dish slowly cooked in the oven. The lid is removed towards the end of the cooking to 
brown the edges of the potato slices. A Hot Pot Supper is a community event in Lancashire. The 
dish is invariably accompanied by pickled red cabbage...Ayto (1993) remarks that in the 18th 
century the term 'hot-pot' referred to a sort of hot punch and that the first writer to use it in print in 
the sense of a meat stew was Mrs. Gaskell...However, the term hotchpotch, now largely obsolete, 
had been used in a similar sense in earlier times. It meant a mixed dish, typically a meat and 
vegetable stew, and was derived via the form hotchpot from the medieval French hochepot (a 
term which survives, referring in modern times to a stew of N. France and S. Belgium, in which 
oxtail and often other meat ingredients figure). The Dutch hutspot belongs to the same family of 
dishes." <br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 389) 
<p>
<b>Dutch Hutspot</b><br>
"Mutton, beef, and veal are prominently featured in the hutspot recipes. These one-pot dishes sometimes contain just one meat 
and seasonings as, for instance, in 'a beef hutspot in the Brabant manner,' in which beef is slowly stewed and, when it is 
almost done, is seasoned with slices of ginger and crushed mace, then served with a butter sauce with chopped parsley. At other 
times, more than one meat or cuts of meat are cooked with a variety of vegetables. Or, at is most extravagant, the hutspot 
becomes an olipodrigo, and a sumptuous olipodrigo at that, which stews to a perfection thirteen different kinds of meat and finishes 
the dish with chestnuts, artichokes, or asparagus, as they are in season." <br>

Press:New York] 1989 (p. 17-18)

"Students [attending Dutch colleges in the 17th century] ate well: on Sunday afternoon they would be given wheat bread soup, salted 
meat, and mutton hutspot (a one-pot meal)with lemons...For variety the week's menu also included another kind of hutspot, this one 
with mutton and carrots or prunes, dried peas with butter or vinegar, and fresh sea or river fish." <br>

<b>Olla Podrida (aka Olio)</b><br>
This complicated slow-cooked meat-intensive stew is traditionally associated with 16th century Andalusia (Spain). Olla Podrida was 
adopted and adapted by countries throughout Europe. Historic recipes attest to the magnitude of committment (time, talent,
foodstuffs) this dish required. Early recipes often span several pages. We wonder? How often was Olla Podria actually
made. We wonder: was this recipe meant to inspire, rather to instruct, ordinary cooks? <a href="foodsoups.html#hodgepodge">Hodge Podge</a>,
a notably simpler version, is daunting in its own right.
<p>
<b>What is Olla Podrida?</b><br>
"Olla podrida is a classic Andalusian stew made from various types of meat--beef, chicken, sausages, sundry parts of pigs--
and vegetables cooked together slowly in a pot. It was first mentioned in English as long ago as the sixteenth century, and the 
term has persisted in the language since then with reference to the stew as a whole. In Spain, however, the tendency is to serve the liquid component of the stew
as soup, and eat the meat and vegetables seperately...In common with other words for stews of variable content, such as hotchpotch...olla podrida has been used
metaphorically in English for any 'heterogeneous jumble.'"<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:London] 2002 (p. 231)
<p>
<b>Why the name?</b><br>
"The latin word olla, meaning cooking pot, passed into Spanish unchanged (and into Portuguese as olha), and gave rise to
the Spanish term 'olla podrida', meaning a spiced stew of various meats and vegetables. In England, changed to olio, this became an accepted culinary term during the
17th century. An olio always had a large range of ingredients."<br>

<p>
Where did the Spanish get this dish?
"...codido madrileno...is the embodiment of Madrid's melting pot...All of these dishes are descendants of Quixote's oli 
podrida, the original 'rotten pot,' or heavy stew, that itself was a descendant of an ancient Jewish dish called adafina, a kind of long-cooking
boiled meal. The adafina was based on chicken or beef, vegetables and hard-boiled eggs...In Spain, at the time of the Inquisition, when
the central provinces became the stronghold of Christianity and it was necessary for the consumer to demonstrate his religious
beliefs, the eggs in the adafina were replaced by large quantities of pork and pork fat..."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Italian wedding soup</b></font><br>
The general concensus among the food people is that Italian wedding soup (originally known as
Minestra Maritata or Pignato Grasso) has nothing to do with wedding ceremonies. This particular
"marriage" (maritata is the Italian word for marriage) is between vegetables...or...depending upon
the region?...sometimes pork and vegetables, in soup. Minestra maritata is usually associated with
the southern-most  parts of Italy. Recipes with pork are said to have originated in Napoli
[Naples].  The phrase "Italian wedding soup" appears to be a recent addition to our gastronomic 
vocabulary. Culinary evidence confirms recipes for soups of this type were simply called (at least
in American cookbooks) minestrone.
<p>
"Minestra. Soup. At one time this term referred to any first course, but today it refers to soup,
specifically one with pieces of vegetable or grain in broth...From [the word] minestare (to
administer), probably because the food was portioned out as the only dish served at a meal.
Minestra has a more liquid consistency than zuppa, which is often poured over roasted or fried
stale bread...Minestra maritata (married soup) is a vegetable soup made in the south in various
local ways. In Naples, it is called pignato grasso, and meat is added to the vegetables."<br>
---<i>Dictionary of Italian Food and Drink</i>, John Mariani [Broadway Books:New York] 1998
(p.154)

<p>
Minestra Maritata is thought to be based upon ancient Roman soup traditions. Culinary evidence
confirms this statement. Although we do not find recipes with this exact name referenced by
Apicius [Ancient Roman cooking text] or Platina [On the Right Pleasure and Good Health, 1475
Italian cook book] there is ample evidence of the existence of vegetable soup during these times.
Soup has long been credited for nourishing the infirm and keeping hungry bellies full. Did you
know the first modern public <a
href="http://dir.salon.com/books/review/2000/03/24/spang/index.html">restaurants</a> (18th
century Paris) were places where soup was served to restore (from the French verb "restaurer")
the patron's health? Some early soup recipes here:

<b>ANCIENT ROME: "166. Minutal Apicianum</b><br>
The Apician minutal is made as follows: oil, broth wine, leek heads, mint, small fish, small tidbits
cock's fries or capon's kidneys and pork sweetbreads; all of these are cooked together. Now
crush pepper, lovage, greeen coriander, or seeds, moistened with broth; add a little honey, and of
the own liquor of the above morsels, wine and honey to taste; bring this to a boiling point skim,

foods) recipes served in broth. "Liquor" in these recipes means the liquid (broth) naturally
occuring as the result of cooking, not a distilled alcoholic product.]

pound them in a mortar, and when they are well pounded, make boil until cooked, with sugar
added in the right amount. My friend Caelius, whose bowel is constricted, uses this, for even if it
is of little nourishment and digests slowly, it nevertheless moves the bowels, increases fertility,

<b>About Italian wedding soup in western PA</b><br>
 Western PA folks of
Italian/American descent
claim this soup is an  "energy fortification" to the newly married couple in order to sustain them
through the
first night of wedded bliss. 
<p>
"I had never heard of Italian Wedding Soup until I came to Pittsburgh in 1992 to marry my future
wife, who
grew up in Mt. Lebanon. The first time my father-in-law ordered wedding soup, I became hooked
forever.
"The problem is that outside of Western Pennsylvania and Eastern Ohio, it is extremely difficult to
garner up
some of that chicken broth with beef meatballs, carrots, spinach, parsley, and of course, acini di
pepi
(pastina). All the Olive Gardens around Pittsburgh have wedding soup. If you go to any other
Olive Garden
in the country, they will not have it. In fact, most Italian restaurants outside Pittsburgh do not
have it. The
nation is being deprived of one, if the not the best, all-around soup in the world.  "In your opinion,
who has
the best wedding soup in Steel Town? How about in The Strip? I'm coming to Pittsburgh in June
for one
week and I can't wait to have several authentic bowls of Italian Wedding Soup."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Oyster stew</b></font><br>
Fish (including shellfish) plays a critical role throughout the Christian calendar. "Meatless" day/periods were proscribed from ancient times forward for practical reasons: they regulated small early meat supplies and unified church members. The long, early spring meatless Lenten season is broken with Easter, featuring ham, lamb and eggs. For traditional Catholics in most countries, Christmas features meat. Christmas Eve, as with Lent, features fish. In Italy, the traditional Christmas Eve table features Seven Fishes. Baccala (salt cod) is front and center. 
Our research confirms Oyster Stew is indeed part of the Irish Christmas Eve tradition. Specifically, Irish-American. Likewise, Oysters (stew, stuffing, scalloped, etc.) play key roles other European cuisines, both at in original country and immigrant tables set in America. While we did not find any print reference confirming a French tradition of Oyster Stew on Christmas Eve, it is certainly likely. Oyster dishes of all sorts are regularly found on French tables. Northern French cuisine features many creamy, butter soups and stews. 
It is important to note that until recently (last half of the 20th century forwards), oysters were commonly consumed, especially by people living close to ocean shores. They were plentiful & cheap. Not the expensive delicacy we think of today.Oysters were indeed expensive for Inland folks, due to shipping costs. 
<p>
<b>The Irish connection</b><br>
"Every Christmas Eve for the past century, the Fitzpatricks in my family have dipped into kettles of rich oyster stew for dinner. I've never quite understood the hallowed tradition. My mother can't explain it, either. Oyster stew -- made with oysters, whole milk, butter, salt and pepper -- is just something my mother grew up eating with her Irish grandparents on Christmas Eve. So we have always eaten it, too. Last Christmas, I mentioned the oyster stew to a friend, who found it a bit unusual. My mother always assumed the stew had something to do with Catholics not eating meat on Christmas Eve in years past. But the stew didn't ring any bells with my Catholic friend. 
I decided to explore this culinary mystery that is sentimentally followed by the Irish side of my family and by many other Irish-American families. I was especially intrigued because oysters today aren't universally considered prized shellfish, and in fact, they are strangely chewy. (The creamy, buttery stew itself is delicious.) Some people strongly dislike oysters but religiously eat oyster stew on Christmas Eve. Apparently, oyster stew is traditional in East Coast cities, where fresh oysters are plentiful. On Christmas Eve, many ethnic cultures enjoy seafood to save their appetites for Christmas Day dinner, according to food historian John Mariani. 
But oyster stew also is uniquely Celtic because it is a holiday connection to the old country -- an Irish-American adaptation of a traditional Christmas Eve stew that was made in Ireland with a chewy Atlantic fish called ling, said John Gleeson, coordinator of the Irish Studies Program at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. "This dried, salted fish would be hung up in a market -- this very large lump of fish -- and a piece would be cut off for a family's stew on Christmas Eve," said Gleeson. Dried ling was eaten only at Christmas, Gleeson said. The ling was stewed with milk (or buttermilk), parsley, salt and pepper because it was tough. It was similar in texture and flavor to the prized oysters that were an autumn delicacy of the Irish gentry, Gleeson said. The oyster stew tradition is as Catholic as it is Irish. Catholics for many years had to eat some sort of fish Christmas Eve because it was a day of abstaining from meat in order to receive Communion at midnight Mass. The Christmas Eve abstinence was discontinued by Vatican II in the mid-1960s, said Michael Maher, a Jesuit priest who grew up in Milwaukee eating oyster stew, even though he never really liked it. Sentiment apparently drives the oyster stew tradition. 
When the Irish began flocking to North America during the Great Potato Famine, during the 1840s and 1850s, they couldn't find ling in American fish markets, Gleeson said. So they picked the closest thing -- oysters -- to remind them of their families and Ireland on Christmas Eve, he said. (Ironically, oysters weren't even part of the gentry's Christmas Eve in Ireland because they were available only in September and October, in season, before modern refrigeration and electricity arrived in the countryside -- amazingly not until the 1960s -- Gleeson said.). Americans, in general, were "oyster mad" in the 1800s, according to Mariani. Oysters were plentiful and were a big part of urban life, especially in East Coast cities where hundreds of thousands of Irish immigrants settled. Part of the appeal to Irish immigrants, Gleeson said, may have been that common folk in Ireland couldn't get oysters. But everyone in America could enjoy them. Oysters were even shipped by stagecoach on the "Oyster Line" from Baltimore to Ohio. Canned or pickled varieties were available as far west as St. Louis by 1856, Mariani said. 
But the high demand depleted the oyster beds in Chesapeake Bay by the 1880s, and the increase in water pollution in cities became so bad that many were concerned typhus would be spread by shellfish that were soaked in local water after delivery and before serving, Mariani said. New sources in the South were tapped, but the supply wasn't nearly as plentiful. That meant oysters were harder to get and were more expensive around the turn of the century, when my great-grandfather, John Michael Fitzpatrick, emigrated from County Kerry, Ireland, to Denison, Iowa. He was a young man, and his sister, Nora, was 13 when they left their family behind in Ireland. They never saw their parents again, according to my great-uncle Leo Fitzpatrick, who still lives in Denison, a small town in western Iowa surrounded by lush, rolling hills reminiscent of Ireland. The Christmas Eve stew tradition was important to the Fitzpatricks because it reminded them of home, Leo said. (He doesn't remember hearing anything about ling fish -- just oysters.). Leo's mother, Mary Frances "Mamie" Behen, whose family emigrated from County Clare, Ireland, in the 19th century, also had a strong tradition of oyster stew. There never was any doubt about what Leo's family would eat on Christmas Eve. 
"Oysters were always expensive, so it was a real treat," he said. "Sometimes, Pop would bring home oysters when he'd sell hogs and there was a little extra money, or after we finished picking corn (by hand). Pop liked oysters a lot." Leo is 92 now, and he and my great-aunt, Esther, are more like beloved grandparents than distant relatives. They treasure their shared Irish heritage, and traveled to Ireland for the first time four years ago, when Leo was 88. Like family before them, there never has been a question at Leo and Esther's house what they will have for dinner on Christmas Eve, even though neither of them much cares for the oysters in the stew. ("It always tastes better the next day," Esther said.). And there never will be any question at my house on Christmas Eve, either. Maher, the Jesuit priest who grew up in Milwaukee with the oyster stew tradition, said his Irish grandmother loved the stew. Maher's mother convinced him to eat it when he was a boy by telling him he might find an oyster pearl on the bottom of the bowl. To this day, Maher still eats the stew on Christmas Eve, as does his brother, John, the executive director of the Irish Cultural & Heritage Center, 2133 W. Wisconsin Ave. 
John Maher remembers as a kid "feeling the sand in my mouth" from the oysters. "I was intrigued by it," he said. "I always thought (the stew) tasty, and it's one of those things . . . You like to support family traditions and keep them going." While oyster stew on Christmas Eve is not widely associated with Ireland, it's the same kind of holiday adaptation as corned beef on St. Patrick's Day, Gleeson said.Shortly after Gleeson emigrated from Dublin in 1980, he was invited to join a local Irish family for Christmas Eve dinner. Although he had eaten ling stew as a boy in Ireland, oyster stew was something new. "I wasn't really enamored with it," he recalled. But Gleeson appreciates the tradition. Ling stew on Christmas Eve has long disappeared from modern Ireland, Gleeson said, even though many Irish-Americans still hold oyster stew dear as a connection to the homeland. "The Irish (in Ireland) are quick to adopt new things," Gleeson said. "They're also very quick to throw the old tradition away." Gleeson hasn't tasted ling stew in 25 years, but thinking about it does make him nostalgic. "Now I'm longing for a piece of ling," said Gleeson, 55. Who knows, Gleeson said. Maybe ling stew will return to vogue in Ireland, just as St. Patrick's Day parades have been adopted there.... 
James Beard, who for decades was considered America's best-loved gourmet, described oyster stew in glowing terms. "If there is any traditional Christmas Eve dish in this country, I guess it is probably Oyster Stew," he once wrote. Beard suggested serving oyster stew with piles of crisp, buttered toast or crisp biscuits. He said it could be made as rich as desired with milk, milk and cream or whipping cream. Some recipes call for seasoning with Worcestershire sauce and cayenne pepper to taste. Beard also suggested heating the bowls and adding a pat of butter to each bowl, keeping the bowls hot until ready to serve. This recipe is the Fitzpatrick (and probably many an Irish family) version of oyster stew. 
<b>Traditional Oyster Stew</b><br>
1 quart shucked oysters, with liquor (oyster liquid)<br>
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter<br>
2 quarts whole milk<br>
Salt and pepper to taste<br>
Oyster crackers<br>
In skillet, combine oysters with butter over low heat until edges of oysters curl. Do not discard oyster liquor.<br>
In large kettle, heat milk to simmer. Add oysters with their liquor, plus salt and pepper to taste. Continue simmering for at least an hour to enhance the flavor. Ladle into bowls and serve with oyster crackers. Makes about 8 servings."
<br>---"A Christmas Eve mystery: An oyster-stew devotee tracks down the tale behind an Irish-American tradition," KAREN HERZOG
<i>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</i> (Wisconsin), December 22, 1999, Food Pg. 1
<p>
"It's said to have been started by Irish immigrants who had fled here during the potato famine in the mid-1800s. The immigrants had been accustomed to a Christmas Eve stew containing ling fish, which wasn't available here. John Gleeson, coordinator of the Irish Studies Program at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, was quoted in a 2001 article in The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel as explaining that the Irish substituted oysters, the closest facsimile in taste. 
A reason for a seafood dish on Christmas Eve was that eating meat the day before a religious feast was proscribed by the Catholic Church. (In Italy, fish soup, "zuppa di pesce," was likewise consumed.) In "True Christmas Spirit" (1955), Rev. Edward J. Sutfin wrote: "Since the vigil is a fast day, fish is in order. Whereas in Brittany the codfish takes the honors of the day, American custom associates piping hot oyster stew with Christmas Eve." In some homes Mexico, Oyster stew ("estofado de ostras") also came to be a dish served on Christmas Eve. Probably because oyster stew is a warming dish, ideal for winter nights, the custom of serving it on Christmas Eve spread throughout the United States, beyond the Irish and Catholic communities. 
Also from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel is this information, contained in a 2002 article: "According to Jerry Apps, University of Wisconsin-Madison professor emeritus and author of numerous books on Wisconsin history: 'By 1900, 50 different ethnic groups were here and each brought along its own costumes, recipes, approaches to the celebration. German celebrations always included, on Christmas Eve, oyster stew.'" That tradition did not emanate from Germany, the waters there being too cold for oysters to dwell in them. A Danish American recounts on the rootsweb.com website: "Christmas Eve at Grandpa and Grandma Johnson's always meant oyster stew with little crackers, celery sticks and dessert." A 1987 article in the Houston Chronicle mentions that in the Gulf area, oyster stew has been "a favorite Christmas Eve dish since the 1800s." 
"Oyster stew is what makes Christmas Eve complete for some families," a <i>Cincinnati Post</i> writer observed in a 2002 article, adding: "It's tradition!" Just as Christmas presents are opened in some families on Christmas Eve, and in others on Christmas morning, oyster stew is served by some as a Yule breakfast or dinner. According to a column last Christmas in the Roanoke (Va.) Times & World News, "The aroma of oyster stew on Christmas morning infiltrates many homes in the Roanoke Valley." The columnist, Cathy Benson, related that the tradition in that vicinage went back to the 19th Century. She wrote: "How to get oysters quickly from the Chesapeake Bay to the Roanoke Valley? The iron horse. According to my 82-year-old father, Jack Thomas, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, none other than the Norfolk and Western Railway carried those perishable but plentiful oysters to Roanoke. 
The transportation of oysters is also discussed in <i>Bill Neal's Southern Cooking</i> (1989). Neal recounts: "Before acceptance of refrigerated food transport (for meat only, first, and that was in the 1880s), inland food supplies depended on the weather. Even after the first frost warm spells threatened the integrity of almost any product, especially seafood. Only December, though the fourth 'R' month, guaranteed enough sustained cold weather for shipping. Then, from Baltimore, to Charleston, to New Orleans, oysters were shoveled onto the flat backs of horse-drawn wagons and packed down in wet straw and seaweed for an inland journey sometimes lasting two weeks or more. Far from the coast, oyster became a symbol of the arrival of the winter holiday season, appearing in the markets by Christmas Eve and on the tables that night as oyster stew." 
Difficult as it is to imagine, not everyone enjoys oyster stew. In the December, 2003 issue of an Arizona State University newsletter, Jerry Coursen, a faculty associate, wrote: "When I was a kid, my father (now deceased) continued a tradition celebrated in his family: the Christmas Eve meal was oyster stew. Growing up, I remember looking forward to oyster stew, then, maybe some caroling or a candlelight service, but the reverie was always quashed by the reality of the fuss that'd ensue as we sat down to the soup. My younger sister hated oyster stew with a passion. We hit kind of a happy compromise when she discovered that the cat would assist her in surreptitiously disposing of her hated oysters.""

Obs.--The palest veal stock, as for white soup, should be used fr this; but for a family dinner, or where economy is a consideration excellent
mutton-broth, made the day before and perfectly cleared from fat, will answer very well as a substitute; milk too may in part take the place of

<a href="vegetables.html#peas">Peas</a> have been consumed by humans from prehistory forwards. Recipes vary according to culture and cuisine. Soup and stews 
are generally enjoyed in cooler climates with ample fuel supply. These long simmering "one pot" meals were economical, filling, forgiving and nutritious.
Medieval European peasants consumed <a href="foodpuddings.html#pease">pease pottage</a> and pease pudding. Wealthy French aristocrats relished fine
pea purees. Scandinavian cultures embraced pea soup (green, fresh & dried, old) to the point of national dish. Because the fresh pea season is short,
split pea soup (dried peas) was a staple dish. Legume (pea, chick pea, bean) purees and sauces are also enjoyed in other parts of the globe. Indian Dhal is one 
example.

comparatively recently it was made from dried peas, usually yellow ones, and consequently had a characteristic yellowish-grey colour which
inspired the application of pea soup and pea-souper to a thick sulphurous fog, particularly of the sort that regularly choked Londoners in the
nineteenth cetury and the first half of the twentieth century...Formerly, pea soup was called pease pottage or pease porridge..."<br>

"Pea soup has been one of the most common soups throughout history and almmost compulsory addition in cookery books from the medieval era to present. It was made from
fresh or dried peas, cometimes with mint, and with or without the meat from which the stock was made. Shredded lettuce, onion, leek, carrot, and the like were added at
the discretion of the cook. The peas were usually pressed through a sieve or mashed with a spoon to thicken the soup so that it was similar in consistency to a cream 
soup. Because any sort of meat or fowl could be used to make stock and dried peas were light in weight, nonperishable, inexpensive, and easy to carry, pea soup was
often prepared outdoors. Unlike beans, which require soaking, dried peas could be put directly to cook which saved time in preparation and added to the popularity of pea 
soup in the outdoor kitchen. It was a popular Lenten dish. Peas found in Spirit Cave, on the border between Burma and Thailand, have been carbon dated to between 9000 and
6000 B.C. Several cultures have used peas since antiquity, including those of Iraq, Switzerland, China, and Egypt. Apicius included nine recipes for peas, some cooked with
vegetables and herbs, others with meat or poultry, in his book. Pease porridge was a well-established dish by that time. The Greek dramatist Aristophanes (c. 446-c. 388 B.C.) worte of pea soup in The Birds. Anne Blencowe
included 'Peas soop,'...in her 1690s reciept book."<br>

<b>English Pea Soup</b><br>
"Like many early cultures, the Anglo-Saxons ate one-pot meals such as soup and porridge, as their daily fare. Even a poor household could afford a single pot to hang
over the fire. Legumes, onions and root vegetables, which are easy to grow in the kitchen garden, and grain provide a nutritional base to which a little meat could
be added. Wealthier kitchens would of course, add more meat. One of the more common vegetable broths mentioned is pea broth."<br>

<b>Swedish Pea Soup</b><br>
  "Swedish pea soup is regarded as a real national dish. It has been served every Thursday in most
  Swedish homes for hundreds of years. During the cold winter it makes a very satisfying meal,
  economical as well as filling. The soup is served as a main course with boiled pork, The traditional
  dessert after pea soup is Swedish Panckakes or "Plattar", served with jam or lingonberries...It
  makes very good eating, although it is a bit on the heavy side for modern people...The exact
  cooking time of the peas is hard to say, some peas take longer than others. There is no harm in
  overcooking, so you can easily cook soup ahead of time."<br>

Pick over and wash peas. Soak oer night, or for several hours in cold water. Put them on to boil in three pints of fresh cold water, and let them simmer until dissolved, adding
enough more water, as it boils away, to keep three pints of liquid in the kettle. Keep it well scraped from the sides of the kettle. When soft, rub through a strainer and 
put on to boil again. Add either water, stock, milk, or cream to make the consistency you wish. It should be more like a puree than a soup. Cook one large tablespoonful of 
butter and one of flour together, and add to the strained soup when boiling. Add the salt and pepper and when it has simmered ten minutes, serve at once with fried dice
of bread. This is delicious made in this simple way. It must always be strained, and thickened with the flour and butter, or it will separate as it cools. It will be smooth, 
perfectly free from grease; and those who like the natural taste of thepease prefer it to any other way of cooking. Do not think you must boil more or less salt pork 
with it, as most receipts advise. It may be varied in many ways, by adding half a can of tomatoes before straining, or by boiling with the peas a small onion which has been cut
fine and fried in a little butter, or by adding any remnants of bone or meat, being careful to remove them before straining. Always use the split peas, as the hulls have
been removed, and they cook much more quickly than the whole peas."<br>

The cuisine of the Canadian shows its spiritual descent from French gastronomy by its rich and recondite sauces, by its slow simmerings--to extract all the nourishing parts
of the food--and buy the refinements which make a meal an act of delicate sensuality.

To make the genuine Canadian pea soup, the soup of the habitant, soak 2 cups (1 pound) of washed dried whole green or yellow peas overnight in 1 1/2 quarts of cold water. 
Next day, discard the water, and risne the peas several times in cold running water. Turn them into a soup kettle with 6 cups of fresh cold water, and add 2 small onions,
each stuck with a whole clove; 1/2 pound of salt pork; 8 whole peppercorns, slightly bruised; 1 generous teaspoon of salt; and the real herbes salees, or if the latter is
unobtainable, a bouquet garni, composed of 8 sprigs of fresh parsley, 2 sprigs of green celery tops (leaves), 1 large bay leaf, and 1 sprig of thyme, tied together with 
kitchen thread. Gradullay bring these to a boil, reduce the flamed, and allow to simmer very, very gently for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, the kettle being only half covered with the lid. Remove
the salt pork, and keep it hot. The turn the contents of the kettle into a fine-meshed sieve, and rub till all the liquid, peas, and onions have been forced through into a fresh soup
kettle. return the soup to the fire, and taste for seasoning. Reheat to the boiling point, then serve in hot soup plates, dropping into each plate a small square of 
salt pork and a few Croutons (No. 780)."<br>

<b>What is "Pepper pot?" </b><br>
"Pepper pot has two overlapping meanings. In the West Indies it means a savoury stew, often 
highly seasoned, incorporating various vegetables and (for example) pieces of pig's tail and 
stewing beef. However, no one recipe can be identified as 'the recipe'...The second meaning, 
which goes back to the 18th century in the USA, was at first equally general and indeed may 
have migrated from the West Indies to the mainland. Later, however, it referred to a particular 
version known as Philadelphia pepper pot, which apparently incorporated sea turtle meat for a 
while in the 19th century by then adopted tripe as a less expensive substitute. In this sense the 
dish always lives up to its name by being highly seasoned with crushed peppercorns." <br>

<b>What is West Indian pepper pot?</b><br>
This thick syrup is made from cassareep, a derivative of <a href="foodfaq.html#cassava">cassava</a>. "...cassareep...is used in making the famous
pepper-pot of Guiana. Just why this delectable dish should be called 'pepper-pot' is an unsolved mystery, for it never contains
pepper and is not hot or peppery*. In fact any form of vegetable placed in the cassareep will ruin it. But it has the strange
property of preserving meat and rendering it tender and if heated every few days it will keep indefinately. Every Indian family and every
white man's home in Guiana has its jar of pepper-pot. Some were first started years, perhaps generations, or for all I know to
the contrary, centuries abo, for the older the pepper-pot th better. All that is necessary is to keep adding meat, the tougher the better, and
fresh cassareep as fast as the contents are used. But beware o adding fish or vegetables or allowing water to enter the jar. Even a minute 
quantity of water, a tiny bit of fish or a single vegetable will completely ruin the entire pepper-pot and render it unfit for human
consumption. But properly made it is a most delicious dish with a rich, peculiar flavor quite impossible to describe...
*In Trinidad and other West Indian islands it is customary to add pepper sauce and red peppers as well as okra, to cassareep when it is served on
the table or on food. Hence many persons think that the cassareep with it means its meat is 'hot' and contains peppers."<br>

"Mrs. Randolph's recipe could be presented as a classically pure version of Philadelphia Pepper Pot, of which apocryphal tales place the 
'invention' during the War of Independence to feed a hungry General Washington at Valley Forge. Pepper pot was, however, a well-known 
dish from the British West Indies, a great soup or stew the ingredients of which were infinitely varied, and thickened or not 
with cassareep (prepared cassava); its unvarying characteristic was the seasoning with cayenne pepper. OED cites Thomas Brown, about 
1702: 'That most delicate palate-scorching soop called pepper-pot, a kind of devil's broth much eat in the West Indies.' A century 
later, Mrs. Rundell gives a typical English interpretation that calls for mutton, pickled pork, mixed vegetables, lobster or crab, 
seasoned with 'salt and Cayenne,' and served with suet dumplings. But I believe that southern colonist had known the dish long before its 
appearance in cookbooks by way of black cooks." <br>

"Another interesting soup is Miss Rutledge's 'Pepper Pot'...in that it seems to come directly from the British West Indies, complete with several 
meats, yams, plantains, spinach, potatoes, optional seafood, dumplings, and the obligatory characterizing 'long red peppers [cayenne],' only
 lacking the cassareep, a cassava preparation, for total authenticity...This authenticity is not surprising, given the strong South Carolina 
connections with Barbados and the Bahamas,,...It is interesting to compare it to the spartan version that came to be considered classic in the
 United States, consisting of tripe, veal bone, suet dumplings, and the characterizing 'pod of pepper'; this version is always claimed by 
Philadelphia, although the earliest receipt I know for it is given by Mary Randolph in 1824, entitled simply 'Pepper Pot.' But it was originally an
 infinitely varied festival dish; Mrs. Rundell [A new System of Domestic Cookery] actually understood it very well." <br>

"Pepperpot is an old term for a family of hot, spicy soups originating in the West Indies as cultural hybrids of Spanish and West African cooking 
traditions. Essentially, Philadelphia pepperpot is gumbo without the okra although the earliest surviving recipes (from the 1760s) contain not only 
okra, but also chopped sunflowers and other curious ingredients. In any case, the pepperpot soup we know today, made with tripe and potatoes,
 is only one member of this large and diverse family, and certainly the least exotic." <br>

<b>Pepper pot creation myths</b><br>
Most cultures offer traditional recipes for thick soups and spiced stews reflecting local taste and indigenous ingredients. Dutch Hutspot, Creole Gumbo, Provencial
Bouilibaisse and <a href="foodsoups.html#goulash">Hungarian Goulash</a> all descend  from this venerable tradition. Which begs the question:
If <a href="foodsoups.html#pepperpot">Pepper Pot</a> is a West Indies dish, why do so many Web sites state it was invented at Valley Forge for General Washington or that was originally Pennsylania Dutch dish? 
When unsubstantiated stories are repeated enough, they become "fact." Colonial Philadelphia was home to a large West Indian population, many of whom were 
professional cooks. Spicy West Indian dishes provided a tasty juxtopostion to classic English, Quaker and German foods. By the time Valley Forge happened
most folks in the area had enjoyed pepper pot for a very long time. This historian accurately debunks the Valley Forge myth but fails to make the West Indian
connection.
<p>
"Pepper Pot, a Philadelphia specialty, was hawked in the streets in the nineteenth century and is still featured in many fine restaurants. The story has been told, over 
and over again , that it was first made at Valley Forge. According to most accounts, George Washington and his men were starving. The general's cook, desperate 
to provide a decent meal for the great man, took a piece of tripe, some spices, and very little else and created a masterpiece. But the tale does not bear close 
scrutiny. In the first place it is an all too obvious imitation of the story of Napoleon and Marengo, food stories, like other stories, tend to repeat themselves. 
Besides, Washington was never starving. As a Virginia aristocrat, while he had a sincere concern for his men's welfare, he took for granted his own comfortable 
lifestyle as an officer and a gentleman. It is much more likely that the thrifty 'Pennsylvania Dutch' brought the idea of tripe soup with them when they came from 
Germany. Moreover, there is a tripe an pepper soup well known in Poland even today, and the border between that country and German has changed so often as 
to have little meaning, at least where culinary customs are concerned." <br>
---<i>Rare Bits: Unusual Origins of Popular Recipes</i>, Patricia Bunning Stevens [Ohio University Press:Athens OH] 1998 (p. 52) 
<p>
William Woys Weaver, in his book <i>Sauerkraut Yankees</i> [2nd edition Stackpole Books:Mechanicsburg PA, 2002 (p. 38-39)], confirms tripe was a common 
ingredient in Pennsylvania Dutch cuisine. He also mentions local tripe is used in Pepper Pot. He does not state, however, this dish descends from European roots. 
The inclusion of Philadelphia Pepper Pot in Pennsylvania Dutch cookbooks seems to perpetuate the myth. Presumably, the recipe was included because it was 
enjoyed by people living in the greater Philadelphia area.

"'Mulligatawny Soup...is, of course, from India. The name is from Tamil milagu-tannir, meaning 'pepper water,' so that it can be said to be a dish
 parallel to pepper pot. Because they do share certain characteristics, it is tempting to suggest a connection, especially since 'Pepper Pot' is 
specific to another British colony in the West Indies...There are myriad versions of both dishes. (I should note that descriptions of pepper pot

century, so that if there is a connection, it is not that simple.)." <br>

"Pepperpot (Trinidad, Barbados, St. Kitts) </b><br>
This meat stew is a very ancient Amerindian dish from Guyana that has spread throughout the English-speaking Caribbean islands... 
The ingredient which gives the dish its distinctive character is cassareep, which the Guyanese pronounce cassarip. It is made by 
grating raw cassava and squeezing out the juice, which is then boiled down. When it begins to turn brown, it is flavoured with salt, 
brown sugar, cinnamon and cloves and the boiling continued until the cassareep has the consistency of a thick, dark brown syrup. Some 
cooks add a little gravy-browning to get the rich colour needed. Commercially bottled cassareep can be bought in some West Indian 
markets. Cassareep keeps indefinitely, and the 'trash', the squeezed dry grated raw cassava can be used to make cassava bread, or biscuits. 
Cooked and drained, it can be adapted for the cassava in the Cuban dish, Brazo Gitano, a baked cassava roll with a corned 
beef filling. All sorts of stories are told about cassareep. It is said to be a meat tenderizer, and/or a preservative and since meats can 
be added to the pot daily there are stories of pepperpots keep going from generation to generation. It should not be confused 
with Jamaican pepperpot, which is a soup. <br>

"She-crab soup. A soup made from blue crabs, crab roe, sherry, and vegetables. It is a specialty of
Charleston, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia, both of which claim credit for the dish's creation,

sour, tangy flavor that marks it as distinct from other crab soups. State law, however, forbids taking
she-crabs with mature eggs, so cooks often use male crabs and immature females and then add eggs
from unfertilized females (which are allowed to be caught). Crumbled egg yolk is sometimes used to
give the traditional orange color of the roe to the soup."<br>

but it was the addition of her red-orange roe that created the dish's depth of flavor and beautiful pale
color and resulted in the name "she-crab" soup. These days, roe is not harvested in an ecological effort
to preserve the supply of crabs. Is it still she-crab soup if there's no roe? Yes-and no. The heart of the
recipe remains the same. But when you can, try it made with roe, and savor every precious spoonful.
You'll find some variations, but purists know the basic recipe is the true Southern tradition. Fresh
crabmeat is essential. For all of you lucky enough to catch your own crabs, you'll need about a dozen. If
you remove the shell of the female crab and discover what looks like a mass of tiny red-orange beads
inside, you've struck gold-I mean roe. Remove it carefully; stir it into the soup with the crabmeat.
(Note: Female crabs with roe on the outside must be returned to the water.) Whether your crabmeat is
from crabs you caught yourself or from the super-market, enjoy a taste of the region."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Stracciatelle & zanzarelli</b></font><br>
This delicate egg drop soup goes by different names in different regions. In Rome, it is called Stracciatelle (stracciatella).
 Food historians trace the genesis to 15th century recipes titled Zanzarelli. Pelligrino Artusi called it Paradise soup.
<a href="foodsoups.html#stracciatellereicpes">Historic recipes</a>, 15th-20th centuries, follow our general notes. Note: Stracciatelle can also
mean chocolate chip ice cream.

<p>
"Stracciatelle is one of the many names --from the stracciatelle of Rome to the zanzarele of Veneto (recalling the zanzarelle of
Martino in the 1460s), the sansarelis or cianciarelis of Fruiti (perhaps all linked to the word for rags, cenci), and the 
grattinato of Pisa (from grattare, to grate, nothing to do with gratin)--for a mixture of stale breadcrumbs, cheese, and eggs swirled
into a boiling broth, creating ragged streaks in clear liquid."<br>
---<i>The Oxford Companion to Italian Food</i>, Gillian Riley [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2007 (p. 515)
<p>
"That Martino's zanzarelli are a precursor to the modern-day stracciatella seems evident...The name of the dish is most probably a northern
Italian pronunciation of the word ciancerelle, from the onomatopoeic ciance...meanting idle chatter, and by extension, when in verb
form, from cianciare, 'to chew with difficulty' or 'to fiddle around.' The entry for ciancerelle in John Florio's posthumously revised Italian-
English dictionary (1690) gives the following definition: 'also a kind of pottage made of herbs, eggs, cheese, and spices.' The 
name for the modern version of the dish, stracciatella, is a diminutive of the Italian straccio, meaning 'rag,' 
from stracciare, 'to rip,' which in turn comes from the spoken Latin extratiare, literally 'to pull off.' In Artusi's great 
nineteenth-century cookbook, this dis is called minestra del paradiso, or 'paradise soup,' because of its 
'heavenly' streak."<br>

"The most Roman of soups is probably stracciatelle (little rags), which you may know as egg-drop soup; into hot consomme (in 
ascending order of goodness, vegetable, beef, chicken or beef-and-chicken) you drop, just before serving, a thin batter of eggs, flour,
grated Parmesan cheese and grated lemon peel, which splits up into little tatters in the soup--hence its name."<br>

chicken-beef broth...as fat-free as possible. To achieve the same taste using canned broths, the proportion should be 1 1/2 quarts
of chicken broth to 1/2 quart of beef broth. There are a number of versions of this soup, and the second most commonly found uses
bread crumbs instead of flour, but we find the results less delightful. For an even lighter soup, leave out the flour
entirely.<br>

boil, add the beaten eggs, stirring constantly with a wire whisk for half a minute or so to make sure all the eggs have been 
cooked by the broth. Remove from the heat, pour into a soup tureen, and if the eggs tend to cling together again, whisk once

for wealthy feasts. Preparations were complicated; presentations were exquisite. Early recipes were served in the orginal shell. <a href="foodsoups.html#mockturtle">Mock turtle soup</a>, substituting calve's heads for the title meat,

"The earliest recipes for dressing sea turtle were given by Richard Bradley (1732), and ascribed by him to a Barbados
lady. ..He did not mention turtle soup, but this soon became a standard feature of English cookery books; it appeared, for example
in the 4th edition (1751) of Hannah Glasse's famous book, <i>The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy</i>. Turtle soup, prepared 
from the calipee (flipper meat) was elevated in the 19th century to become a 'must' for civic
banquets and suchlike occasions; and, since it was difficult and expensive to make, recipes for Mock Turtle soup, of 
which first seems to have been in Hannah Glasse's 6th edition (1758), became increasingly frequent."<br>

"An innovation in the middle years of the eighteenth century was turtle soup. At that time it was discovered that West Indian
green turtles, siad to be far superior to the other local varieties in wholesomeness and rareness fo taste, could survive the
shipboard  journey to England if kept in tanks of fresh water. With them came recipes for cooking them 'in West India fashion',
to furnish the feasts of the wealthy. A turtle of sixty or a hundred pounds was large enough to provide a  whole first course in 
itself. Its belly and back were boiled and baked respectively, and laid out at the top and bottom of the table, the fins and guts
were strewed in rich sauces to provide corner dishes, while a tureen of turtle soup, made from the head and lights, had the place
of honour in the centre. Only a few people could aspire to turtle dinners; but mock turtle made its appearance in the cookery 
books almost as soon as the genuine article."<br>

"Perhaps the most appreciated soup was turtle. The green sea turtle, so named because of its greenish fat, has been consumed for several
hundred years and was once a major source of fresh food for exploring Europeans and pirates. Pliny write about cave-dwellers who ate
turtle flesh although they worshipped the turtle. Throughout the 1600s and beyond, seafarers caught he great turtles and kept them 
on ships until they were killed and cooked...Turtle soup's virtue was that it did not 'cloy.' or produce ill effects, no matter the
quantity eaten, even though it was often richly spiced...Isabella Beeton later pronounced turtle soup 'the most expensive soup brought to
the table,' and advised that when live turtle was too dear [costly], many cooks used tinned turtle meat."<br>

"Turtles were found in abundance in the New World, and they were eaten from the beginning of
European settlement. Terrapin turtles were particularly prized. Female turtles, or cow turtles, were
treasured for the meat. The male, or bull turtles, had little value and were generally used for
making soup. As turtle meat used in soup making was bland, it was usually spiced with red
pepper. Turtles were easy to transport long distances and were held in pens until sold. Prior to the
Civil War, they were so plentiful as to be considered slave food in the South. In the North, turtle
meat and turtle soup were prized. The French gastronome Jean-Anthelme Brillat-Savarin enjoyed
turtle soup in New York City during his stay in America in the 1790s. From the earliest
American cookbooks, directions for making turtle soup were included. For instance, the longest
and most complicated recipe in Amelia Simmon's American Cookery (1796) is for dressing
turtles. She also includes a simpler recipe for preparing calf's head in the fashion of a turtle.
Randolph's Virginia House-wife includes directions for making turtle soup...Turtle soup was
difficult to prepare at home. As soon as turtles were killed, they had to be cooked. Because many
turtles were extremely large, frequently weighing three hundred pounds, they were sold to cafes,
taverns, and restaurants that had a high volume of business."<br>

"To dress a turtle the West Indian way</b><br>
Take the turtle out of the water the night before you intend to dress it, and lay it on its back, in the morning cut its throat or the 
head off, and let it bleed well; then cut off the fins, scald, scale and trim them with the head, then raise the callepy (which is the belly or under-shell)
clean off, leaving ot it as much meat as you conveniently can; then take for the back-shell all the meat and intrails, excpet the monsieur, which is the fat, and looks
green, that must be baked to and with the shell; wash all clean with salt and water, and cut into pieces of moderate size, taking from it the bones, and put them with the find and
head in a soop-pot, with a gallon of water, some salt, and two blades of mace. When it boils skim it clean then put in a bunch of thyme, parsley, savoury and 
young onions, and your veal part, except about one pound and a half, which must be made force-meat of as for Scotch collops, adding a little Cayan
pepper; when the veal has boiled in the soop about an hour, take it out and cut it in pieces and put to the other part. The guts 
(which is reckoned the best part) must be split ovpen, scraped and made clean, and cut as the other parts, the size you 
think proper; then put them with the guts and other parts, except the liver, with half a pound of good fresh butter, a few shalots, a 
bunch of thyme, parsley, and a little savoury, seasoned with salt, white pepper, mace, three or four cloves beaten, a little Cayan
pepper, and take care not to put too much then let it stew about half an hour over a good charcoal fire, ane put in a pint and
 a half of Madeira wine and as much of the broth as will cover it, and let it stew until tender. It will take four or
five hours doing. When almost enough, skim it, and thicken it with flour, mixt with some veal broth, about the thickness of a fricasey. Let
your force-meat balls be fried about the size of a walnut, and be stewed about half an hour with the rest; if any eggs, let thembe boiled and

back-shell, with the eggs all over, and put it into the oven to 
brown, or do it with a salamander. The callepy must be slashed in several places, and moderately seasoned, with pieces of
butter, mixt with chopped thyme, parsley and young onions, with salt, white pepper and mace beaten, and a little Cayan pepper; put a piece on each
slash and then some over, and a dust of flour; then bake it in a tin of iron dripping-pan, in a brisk oven. The backhesll (which
is called the callepash) must be seasoned as the callepy, and baked in a dripping-pan, set upright, with four brickbats, or any thing else. 
An hour and a half will bake it, which must be done before the stew is put in. The fins, when boiled very tender, to be taken out of the soop, and put into a stew-pan,
with some good veal gravy, not high-coloured, a little Madeira wine, seasoned and thickend as the callepash, and served in a
dish by itself. The veal part may be made fiandos, or Scotch collops of. The liver should never be stewed with the callepahs, but
always drest by itself, after any manner you like; except you separate the lights and heart from the callepash, and then always serve then
together in one dish. Take care to strain the soop, and serve it in a tureen, or clean china bowl. Dishes. A Calleply, Lights, &c.--Soop--

"Turtle Soup. </b><br>
Take the whole of the turtle out of its shell; cut it in pieces, that it may be more easily scalded.
Throw these pieces, with the fins, into the pot, and when scalded, take off the coarse skin of the
fins and lay them aside to make another dish. The thick skin of the stomach must also be take off;
under it lies the fat, or what is termed the citron. Thus prepared, it is ready for making the soup.
Take a leg of beef, and boil it to a gravy, cut up the turtle in small pieces, throw them into the pot
with the beef, and add as much water as will cover the whole about two inches. Let it boil slowly
for about three hours. The seasoning and the citron should be put in when the soup is half done.
To two quarts and a half of soup (which will fill a large tureen,) add half an ounce of mace, a
desert-spoonful of allspice, a tea-spoonful of cloves, and salt and pepper, black and cayanne, to
your taste. Tie up a bunch of parsley, thyme, and onions, and throw them into the soup while
boiling; when nearly done, thicken with two table-spoonfuls of flour. To give it a good color,
take about a table-spoonful of brown sugar and burn it; when sufficiently burnt, add a wine-glass
of water. Of this coloring, put about two table-spoonfuls in the soup, and just before serving,
throw in half a pint of Madeira wine."<br>

<b>Melokhia</b><br>
Melokhia is a meat and vegetable soup possibly dating to the ancient Egyptians. Recipes vary through time and family. 
The primary ingredient, 
<a href="vegetables.html#jewsmallow">melokhia</a> (aka Jew's Mallow) is the culinary connector.
 <p>
"Melokia is one of Egypt's national dishes. It is an ancient peasant soup, the making of which is believed to be portrayed in Pharaonic tomb paintings. The medieval melokhia seems to have been a little 
richer, incorporating fried ground meat and chicken balls. Today, only a few families add these. This soup has the quantities of the Egyptian peasant: his timelessness and his 
harmony with nature, the seasons, and the soil....Peasant women prepare this soup almost daily...Melohkia has recently acquired a symbolic and patriotic importance in 
Egypt, for it represents the national, popular taste as opposed to the more snobbish and cosmopolitan taste of the old regime. Most families have their own special way of preparing it 
and the proportions vary according to the financial means, position, and preferences of the people who make it. Here is a 
traditional recipe: <br>
7-10 cups chicken, rabbit, goose, duck or meat stock <br>
Salt and black pepper <br>
2 ls. fresh melokhia or 1/4 lb. dried melokhia leaves <br>
2-3 cloves garlic <br>
Salt <br>
2 1/2 tablespoons butter or oil <br>
1 tablespoon ground coriander <br>
Cayenne pepper. <brf>
To make the stock: boil a whole chicken or rabbit half a goose a duck or a piece of lamb, beef or veal (I suggest knuckle of beef or veal) for 2 to 3 hours, removing scum from 
time to time. Season with salt and pepper. You can do this before you cook the soup. Remove the bird or piece of meat, bone it if necessary, and discard the bones. If you are using 
fresh leaves, cut off the stalks. Wash and drain the leaves, and spread them out on a cloth to dry. With a mezzaluna chopper or whatever chopping knife you are used to chop the 
leaves on a board until almost reduced to a puree. If you are using dried melokhia, crush the leaves with your hands into a large bowl or use an electric blender, and our a 
little hot water over them. Let them swell until doubled in bulk sprinkling with a little more water if necessary. (If the leaves are not brittle enough to be crushed, try drying them 
out by putting them scattered over a large baking sheet, in a turned-off hot oven for 5 minutes). Stain the stock into a large saucepan and bring to the boil. Add the prepared melokhia leaves and 
stir well. Boil for 5 to 10 minutes if fresh, and 20 to 30 minutes if fried leaves have been used. Prepare the taklia (garlic sauce). Crush the garlic with a little salt, using more or less garlic as you 
prefer. Fry it in butter or oil (in Egypt samna, a clarified butter, is used). When the garlic is golden brown, add the coriander and a good pinch of cayenne pepper. Mix thoroughly to a paste and 
fry a little longer. Add this preparation to the soup, cover the pan tightly, and simmer for a further 2 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent the leaves from falling to the bottom,
and do not overcook for the same reason. The melokhia should stay suspended throughout the stock. Taste and adjust the seasoning. This can be served on its own first as a soup then 
accompanied by plain rice (which can be cooked in some of the stock), and finally with pieces of the meat used for making the stock. Cut into serving pieces and reheated. I like to make a 
richer stock by adding 2 leeks 2 turnips, 2 tomatoes, skinned and quartered, 1 onion, and a clove of garlic at the start. When the stock has cooked for a few hours, remove the vegetables together with 
the meat and proceed as described above." <br>

<p>
<b>[1840]<br>
"Mock Turtle or Calf's Head Soup</b><br>
This soup will require eight hours to prepare. Take a large calf's head, and having cleaned, washed, and soaked it, put it into a pot with a knuckle of veal, and the hock of a ham, or a few slices of bacon; but previously cut off and reserve enough of the veal to make two dozen small force-meat 
balls. Put the head and the other meat into as much water as will cover it very well, so that it may not be necessary to replenish it: this soup being always made very rich. Let it boil slowly four hours, skimming it carefully. As soon as no more scum rises, put in six potatoes, and three turnips, all sliced thin; with equal proportions of parsley, sweet marjoram, and sweet basil, chopped fine; and pepper and salt to your taste.
An hour before you send the meat to table, make about two dozen small force-meat balls of minced veal and beef-suet in equal quantities, seasoned with pepper and salt; sweet herbs, grated lemon-peel, and powdered nutmeg and mace. Add some beaten yolk of egg to make all these ingredients stick together. Flour the balls very well, and fry them in butter. Before you put them into the soup, take out the head, and the other meat. Cut the meat from the head in small pieces, and return it to the soup. When the soup is nearly done, stir in half a pint of Madeira. Have ready at least a dozen egg-balls made of the yolks of hard boiled eggs, grated or pounded in a mortar, and mixed with a little flour and sufficient raw yolk of egg to bind them. Make them up into the form and size of boy's marbles. Throw them into the soup at the last, and also squeeze in the juice of a lemon. Let it get another slow boil, and then put it into the tureen.
We omit a receipt for real turtle soup, as when that very expensive, complicated, and difficult dish is prepared in a private family, it is advisable to hire a first-rate cook for the express purpose.
an easy way is to get it ready made, in any quantity you please, from a turtle soup house."<br>

The earliest print reference we find for turtle soups manufactured by the Campbell Soup company is from 1890. These were produced under the Franco-American 
label, owned by Campbell. There were three choices: Terrapin, Green Turtle and Mock Turtle. Our research confirms the Mock Turtle product remained available
 until about the 1930s. An article from the mid-1950s indicates an attempt to revive the product. The effort failed. Turtle Soup (mock & otherwise) took its place
on the pantry shelf of history.

"Within five years of its first five soups, the Joseph Campbell's Company had expanded its line to include twenty-one varieties. (It is not clear what was magical 
about the number twenty-one, but despite occasional additions and subtractions, for the next thirty years the company manufactured exactly that number of soups). 
The initial repertoire of Campbell's Soups would probably have pleased Escoffier. (All, with the exception of Mock Turtle and Pepper Pot, are included in his 
famous 1904 cookbook A Guide to the Fine Art of French Cuisine.) When advertised, these first soups were usually listed alphabetically: Asparagus, Beef, 
Bouillon, Celery, Chicken, Chicken Gumbo, Clam Bouillon, Clam Chowder, Consomme, Julienne, Mock Turtle, Mulligatawny, Mutton, Oxtail, Pea, Pepper Pot, 
Printanier, Tomato, Tomato Okra, Vegetable, Vermicelli-Tomato...Mock Turtle seems to have been created to make up for the unavailability in many parts of the

 Most food historians generally attribute the creation of this cold soup to Louis Diat, Chef at the
Ritz-Carleton in New York in 1917. There are, however, some conflicting facts that make this
story interesting. Was Mr. Diat the first to make French-style cream of leek and potato soup?
Culinary evidence suggests not. Recipe 696 in Escoffier's <i>Le Guide Culinaire</i> (1907)
provides instructions for Puree Parmentier. Jules Gouffe's <i>Royal Cookery Book</i> (
1869) contains a recipe for Potato and Leek Soup. The difference? Escoffier's and Gouffe's soups
were served hot.
Mr. Diat's Vichyssoise was served cold. If there is a connection to Vichy (beyond the name) it has
not been preserved for posterity.
<p>
"Vichyssiose a chilled potato and leek cream soup created by a French chef, Louis Diat, in New
York early in the 20th century. Of those who identify 1917 as the year of its creation, none gives
chapter and verse. Hofler gives as the first occurrence in print in French a reference in an issue of
<i>La Revue culinaire</i> of 1923, where the dish is identified as an item of American
cuisine."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 
826)
<p>
"Vichyssoise was created by Chef Louis Diat at the Ritz in New York City. In <i>American
Food</i> (1975) Evan Jones said the soup was first served in 1910, while <i>The American
Heritage Cookbook</i> (1980) adds, "[The soup] was served for the first time to Charles
Schwab, the steel magnate" for the opening of the hotel's roof garden. But there are several things
wrong with these assertions: Diat did come to work at the Ritz-Carleton sometime in 1910, but
the restaurant did not open until December 14 of that year, and this was not the roof-garden
restaurant in any case....the menu for that opening night's meal was listed in <i>The New York
Times</i> the next day; the soup served was a turtle soup, not leek and potato...Diat himself
remarked, in his book <i>Louis Diat's Cookbook</i> (1946), that "one of my earliest food
memories is of my mother's good Leek and Potato soup...When I first came to this country I
actually couldn't find any [leeks]. I finally persuaded one of my vegetable suppliers to find
someone who would grow leeks for me." It is unlikely that Diat found someone to grow leeks
quickly enough to have them in time for the opening in 1910...Curiously enough, Diat does not
mention his famous soup by name in his 1946 cookbook...Elizabeth David...in her <i>French
Provincial Cooking</i> (1960), gave, without comment, the date 1917 as the year of the soup's
creation."<br>

Food historians tell us mulligatawny soup is an Anglo-Indian recipe originating in 18th century India. The <i>Oxford
English Dictionary</i> records the first print reference as 1784. Mulligatawny soup
recipe was introduced throughout the British Empire, including the American colonies. <a href="foodsoups.html#pepperpot">Pepper Pot soup</a>, of West Indian origin, 
appears to be a related recipe.
<p>
"Mulligatawny. This hot spicy soup first entered British cuisine at the end of the eighteenth century; it had
found favour with employees of the East India Company on station in the subcontinent, and when they
returned home they brought it with them--although the soup it has evolved into in British hands, heavily
dependent on commercial curry powder, bears little resemblance to its aromatic South Indian original. The
name comes from Tamil milakutanni, a compound of milaku  pepper' and tanni,  water'. It standardly
includes meat of meat stock, but Eliza Acton gives a vegetarian version made from marrows, cucumbers,
and apples or tomatoes. In the early nineteenth century the word, or its abbreviation mull, was used in
Anglo-Indian slang for members of the government service in Madras..."<br>

of the Tamil milagu-tannir, "pepper-water"; showing the correctness of the popular belief which ascribes
the origin of this excellent article to Madras.' ..The simple concept of pepper water was greatly elaborated

"Among the low-caste poor of southern India it was a common practice to add to their pepper water a tiny salt fish known as karavat, but naturally it never
occurred to the predominatly vegetatrian Hindus of southern India to beef up the soup with meat stock and add small pieces of meat to the 
finished product. When the British came along and did just that, mulligatawny soup was born. The name of this most celebrated of Anglo-Indian dishes
is a corruption of two Tamil words, milagu and tunni, meaning simply 'pepper water.' The dish evolved in the Madras Presidency. Its
composition resembles a Madras curry and one some formal memus of British India we find the soup translated into French as potage
de Madras. The residents of Madras were even nicknamed 'Mulls' after their famous creation. Mulligatawny became popular with army 
officers, who carried it in flasks on expeditions in the hills as fortification against the cold. At its simplest, milligatawny consists of little more than
meat, onions, curry powder and stock or water...In the early nineteenth century retired East India Company merchants sparked off a 
fashion for mulligatawny back in England. Inevitably, the soup began to take on the stamp of the English kitchen: apple was substituted
for mango juice of Indian recipes, and the freshly ground spice mixtures repaced by curry powder. Indeed, the recipe was originally
dubbed 'curry soup', as the inimitable Dr Kitchiner indicates in <i>The Cooks Oracle</i> in 1817...A measure of its popularity was the appearance on 
the market, about the middle of the century, of tins of 'mulligatawny paste'--condiments to be mixed with meat stock, garlic
and onions. All the great cookery writers of the period gave their own recipes: Eliza Acton, in her <i>Modern Cookery for Private Families</i>, included a
meatless version with marrow, cucumber and apple while Mrs Beeton replaced the coconut with ground almonds. Alexis Soyer,
the celebrated chef at the Reform Club, concocted a Frenchified version which bore very little relation to the original, incorporating
hame, thyme and apple, while Escoffier's was virtually unmanagable. In general, it is the Anglo-Indian variations which remain the most
interesting. There also appeared on menus a clear mulligatawny, also known as consomme mulligatawny or, in the rather contrived
French of Victorian menus in India, as consomme a l'Indienne."<br>

"Mulligatawny. Literally, pepper water (milagu-thannir) in tamil; this was the rasam of south India, which
was adopted with such modifications as the addition of meat stock as a soup by the colonial. A British
prisoner of Hyder Ali in AD 1784 sang mournfully;
"In vain our hard fate we repine,
In vain our fortunes we rail;
On Mullighy-tawny we dine,
On Conjee, in Bangalore jail."
In fact the colonials who lived in Madras were derisively referred to as Mulls..."<br>

"Mullagatawny Soup.</b><br>
Slice, and fry gently in some good butter three or four large onions, and when they are of a fine equal amber-colour lift them out
 with a slice and put them into a deep stewpot, or large thick saucepan; throw a little more butter into the pan, and then brown
lightly in it a young rabbit, or the prime joints of two, or a fowl cut down small, and floured. When the meat is sufficently
browned, lay it upon the onions, pour gradually to them a wquart of good boiling stock, and stew it gently from three quarters of an hour to 
an hour; then take it out, and pass the stock and onions thorugh a fine sieve or strainer. Add to them two pints and a half more of stock, pour
 the whole into a clean pan, and when it boils stir to it two tablespoonsful of currie-powder mixed with nearly as much of browned flour, and
a little cold water or broth, put in the meat, and simmer it for twenty minutes or longer should it not be perfectly tender, add the 
juice of a small lemon just before it is dished, serve it very hot, and send boiled rice to table with it. Part of a pickled mango cut into strips about
the size of large straws, is sometimes served in this soup, after being stewed in it for a few minutes; a little of the picle itslef should be added with
it. We have given here the sort of receipt commonly used in England for mullagatawny, but a much finer soup may be made by departing from it in some
respects. The onions, of which the proportion may be increased or diminished to the taste, after being fried slowly and with
care, that no part would be overdone, may be stewed for an hour in the first quart of stock with three or four ounces of grated
cocoa-nut, which will impart a rich mellow flavour to the whole. After all of this that can be rubbed through th sieve has been added to as
much more stock as will be required for the soup, and the currie-po0wder and thickening have been boiled in it for twenty minutes, the
flesh part of a calf's head,* prefious stewed almost tender, and cut as for mock turtle, with a sweetbread also parboiled or stewed
 in broth, and divided into inch-squares, will make and admirable mullagatawny, if simmered in the stock until they have take the flavour
 of the currie-seasoning. The flesh of a coupe of calve's feet, with a sweetbread or two, may, when more convenient, be substituted for the head.
A large cupful of thick  cream, first mixed and boiled with a teaspoonful of flour or arrow-root to prevent its circling, and stirred
into the soup before the lemon-juice, will enrich and improve it much.<br>

<b>"A Good Vegetable Mullagatawny.</b><br>
Dissolve in a large stewpan or thick iron saucepan, four ounces of butter, and when it is on the point of browning, throw in four large
mild onions sliced, thre pounds weight of young vegetable marrow cut in large dice and clared from the skin and seeds, four larbe or six
moderate-sizced cucumbers, pared, split, and emptied likewise of their seeds, and from three to six large acid apples, according to the taste; shake the pan often,
and stew these over a gentle fire until they are tolerably tender; then strew lightly over the mix well amongst them, three heaped tablespoonsful of 
mild currie powder, with nearly a third as much of salt, and let the vegetables stew form twenty to thirty minutes longer; then 
pour to them gradually sufficient boiling water (broth or stock if preferred) to just cover them, and when they are reduced almost to a pulp
 press the whole through a hair-sieve with a wooden spoon,and heat it in a clean stewpan, with as much additional liquid as will make two wquarts with that which was first 
added. Give any flavouring that may be needed, whether of salt, cayenne or acid and serve the soup extremely hot. Should
 any butter appear on the surface, let it be carefully skimmed off, or stir in a small dessertspoonful of arrow-root (smoothly mixed
with a little cold broth or water) to absorb it. Rice may be served with this soup, at pleasure, but as it is of the consistence
 of winter peas soup, it scarcely requires any addition. The currie powder may be altogether omitted for variety, and the whole converted into a 
plain vegetable potage; or it may be rendered one of high savour, by browning all the vegetables lightly, and adding them to rich 
brown stock. Tomatas, when in season, may be substituted for apples, after being divided, and freed from their seeds.<br>

broth from the stew-pan, mixed with a little rice flour. When thoroughly mixed, stir the seasoning into the soup, and simmer it till it is as
smooth and thick as cream, and till the chicken or veal is perfectly tender. Then stir into it the juice of a lemon; and five minutes

"Mulligatawny Soup.</b><br>
This is soup of any kind flavoured with curry powder. It is highly stimulating, gives tone and vigor to the digestive organs, and is
frequently accetable in very hot or very cold climates. Nevertheless we do not recommend its frequent use, though it may
occasionally be resorted to on festive occasions. When made in India, the curry powder is largely mixed with coriander, cassia,
cayenne pepper, black and white pepper, curmeric [turmeric], garlic mixed with lemon-acid or sour apples, mangoes, tamarinds, or other 
acidulous fruit; but it is now needless to prepare and mix all these ingredients, as a large or small botttle of well-purposed
curries, to suit and palate, may be purchased at any oilman's store. If a clain curry or mullagatawny soup is preferred, 
mix the powder with equal quantity of browned flour and a little cold stock or broth, which may be put in with the meat of the 
soup hlaf an hour before serving. Soft meats, flow., &c., may be wholly stewed in this curry stock, though the finer sorts of curries will not
admit this, mangoes, tamarineds, &c., taking only a few minutes; but the exprienced cook will readily distinguish and determine
 on such additions. With a plain curry there should be a flavouring of lemon-acid just before serving. It is almost impossible to devine
precisely what should be the several ingredients of the more complex curries--the cook must study the likings of the guests--
some do not like coriander-seed, others dislike garlic; cassis in some cases is disagreeable; though, when all those ingredients are carefully 
proportioned with just sufficient cayenne to stimulate, it should be found a most enjoyable soup. The housekeeper will readily understand
that any good stock soup may be converted into mullagatawny or curry soup, but as it usually occupies considerable space in 
every cookery-book, we add a few examples, pointing from the simple soup above mentioned to more expensive dishes." (p. 430)<br>

<b>"Indian Mullagatawny Soup.</b><br>
For this favourite Indian soup take a couple of chickens, a large fowl, a knuckle of veal, or a calf's head, with the trimmings, 
bones, and gristles of the breast of veal. Make a good strong stock; this must be carefully attended to. Cut the meat in pieces--mouthfuls--
or the fouwl into small joints, and simmer gently in about half a gallon of water. Fry six midle-sized onions and a couple of cloves of garlic shred
fine, in two ounces of butter. Pound and mix well together an ouince of coriander seed, a quarter of an ounce each of chives, turmeric, and 
cassia, two drachms of cayenne, and rather more of black pepper. Put these ingredients with two large spoonfuls of rice flour into a basin,
mix them with some of the broth the meat has been boiled in, and strain to the rest. Simmer until the soup is aobut the thickness of cream. Before
taking it off the fire add the juice of a lemon to flavour it. Some people use sour apples or other acids in mullagatawny, but the lemon-juice is 
preferable. Serve the meat in the soup and boiled rice separately; cut lwmons on a plate. Time, simmer from two to three hours.

"Mulligatawny and Curry Soups</b><br>
The curry soups vary considerably in the degree of spiciness, but they should not, for the normal palate, be over-peppery--certianly
not so pepper as a curry itself may be. Some of theme may be quite bland in seasoning, tasting of nuts and spices and agreeable to the most
sensitive palate. If you like cooking and like spices you will not be satisfiled with having just a tin of curry-pwoder and one of
paste in your store-room, but you will have, as mentioned in the curry chapter, the individual spices which together make the
generally accepted curry-powder; and you will certainly have desiccated nuts of some kind, preferably coco-nut and almonds. There are three distinct
types of mulligatawny; it can be in the form of <br>
(a) consomme<br>
(b) gravy broth<br>
(c) thick soup<br>
The base of the first is a good bouillon or stock, and the flavouring is imparted to it by the infusion in it by whole spices. The following
recipe calls for beef bouillon, but Mulligatawny Maigre, which is not the real thing, may be made exactly the same way, using
vegetable stock.
<p>
<b>Consomme Mulligatawny</b><br>
3 pints well-flavoured beef bouillon (see page 119)<br>
1/2 lb. minced gravy beef<br>
2 egg whites<br>
2 tablespoons good Madeira<br>
Spices for infusing<br>
1/2 oz. each of coriander and cardamon<br>
1/4 oz. each of cumin seed and fenugreek<br>
12 peppercorns<br>
1 clove garlic<br>
thinly peeled rind of 1 lemon<br>
1 bay-leaf<br>
seasoning<br>
Garnish<br>
3 oz. rice<br>
1/4 oz. butter<br>
a little turmeric<br>
quarters of lemon<br>
Bruise of pound lightly the spices and garlic, and put together with lemon rind and bay-leaf into a muslin bag tied tightly at
the neck so that they cannot escape. Put the bag into the bouillon; bring to boil and keep at simmering-point until the liquid is
well flavoured with spices. This takes from 40 minutes to an hour. Remove the bag; allow the bouillon to cool, and clarify in the
following manner. Put the minced beef into an enamel or tin-lined pan, add whites whipped to a froth and the bouillon. Whisk over moderate heat until 
it boils. Then stop whisking and allow the liquid to boil up. Draw aside and set on very low heat for half an hour. Strain carefully through a we cloth, 
season, add Madeira, and reheat without allowing soup to boil. Hard boiled rice, mixed with butter and coloured lightly with the addition of a
little turmeric, and also quarters of lemon."<br>

Legume (beans, peas) soups and pottage have been filling empty bellies from ancient times forward. Nutritious, economical, portable, and forgiving, these dishes 
graced both kingly feasts and humble peasant tables. Recipes varied according to place and taste. Wealthier people added meat (typically pork--ham, bacon) and
 spices. Local vegetables rounded out the meal. Beans and peas were easily dried and readily transported, making them proteins of choice for military rations,
 explorer fare, and starvation sustenance. One of the most well known recipes in the genre is <a href="foodpuddings.html#pease">pease porridge</a>
(aka peas pottage). New England baked beans was another popular early American combination.

<b>What are "navy" beans?</b>
<p>
"Navy bean is the American name for the small white haricot bean, the bean used for baked beans. It presumably arose from the bean having formed an important 
element in the navy's shipboard diet."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 225) 
<p>
"Navy bean. Also called 'pea bean' or 'beautiful bean.' The navy bean is one of several varieties of kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). The name comes from the fact
 that it has been a standard food of the United States Navy since at least 1856."<br>
---<i>The Encyclopedia of American Food & Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 216) 
<p>
"Beans have...long been associated with navies, as the name navy bean suggests. They were probably the food the crew was forced to endure once the fresh
 food ran out. Once the beans themselves were gone that would have been the end, and the saying in French 'la find des haricots' meaning the absolute end of 
everything may derive from this recognition...It might seem off that beans would find a place where fuel would be a precious resource and cooking time would have
 to be kept to a minimum. But according to Pablo Perez-Mallaina, beans (chickpeas mostly at first) were a regular provision on Spanish ships crossing the Atlantic
 from the earliest voyages. The brisk stoves would be kept on the lower deck away from wind and set in sand to prevent anything from catching on fire. And with 
plenty of time, there was little problem with soaking the beans. A typical week's rations for a sailor on the US Navy in 1799 would include 7 pounds of bread in the
 form of hard tack, 2 pounds of pickled beef, 3 of pork, 1 of salt fish, and one and a half pints of peas or beans, plus potatoes, turnips and the daily half pint of rum.
 The term navy bean comes from the fact that since the mid-nineteenth century, they were issued regularly to US warships...For similar reasons, beans made an
 ideal army food."<br>

<b>About navy bean soup</b><br>
Bean soups are ancient. American bean soups made with specifically with navy beans surface in the the mid-nineteenth century. The earliest print American reference we 
have for a recipe titled "navy bean soup" was published in the <i>Dubuque Daily Herald</i> [IA]. October 6. 1900 (p. 8): 
"It is easy to imagine these old weatherbeaten sailors strolling along the wharves of Albany relating their naval adventures. And how they fought with Farragut at the 
Battle of Mobile Bay...And how they swapped their navy bean soup for the luscious fruits of the Indies."

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Pocket soup</b></font><br>
The first recipes for Pocket soup (aka "veal glue," "portable soup," "quick soup," or "cake soup") appear in cookbooks shortly
after the publication of Denys Papin's 1681 scholarly treatise on steam cooking <i>A New Digester or Engine for Softening Bones</i>.
High-pressured steam cooking efficiently reduced meat products to concentrated gelatinous forms of various textures.
Arguably, Veal Glue and Portable Soup are the progenitors of today's gravy starters. Pocket soup withstood additional
processing, rendering a hard substance similar to today's bouillon cube. The end results were lightweight, portable,
 easily reconsituted, nutritious, and filling. Not so very different from today's "add water" commercial food products.
<p>
Late 17th-early 18th century homes were not physics laboratories. Forward thinking cook book authors somehow found 
a way to achieve similar results with common household items. Early pocket soup recipes were time consuming and complicated, 
suggesting it was not commonly made at homne or found in family pantries. 
<a href="foodpioneer.html#lewis">Lewis & Clark</a> were famous for stocking mass quantities of commercial pocket soup 
to ensure their expedition crew would not starve. By the mid-nineteenth century, scientific advances (dehydration) and industrialization permitted
the mass production of several foods based on pocket soup. Meat biscuits, dessicated vegetables
were produced in factories and provided to Union Civil War soldiers. Knorr marketed dried
soups to the general public in the 1870s. 
<p>
"With the vogue [late 17th century] for thin soup based on chicken or veal broth came a new
invention. Its earliest name was  'veal glue', and it was the forerunner of the bouillon cube. Strong
veal stock was slowly stewed for many hours, strained and simmered again, allowed to set,
scrapted free of sediment, and then gently cooked...It was a great deal of work for such a small
output. But veal glue, its name later changed to  'pocket' or  'portable' soup, continued in demand
all through the eighteenth century. Jam or beef or sweet herbs were now often boiled with the
veal, to give a tastier flavour."<br>
---<i>Food and Drink in Britain: From the Stone Age to the 19th Century</i>, C. Anne Wilson [Academy Chicago:Chicago] 1991 (p. 224)
<p>
"Portable soup<br>
a product which achieved some prominence in 18th-century English cookery books, was a
precursor (and a relatively sophisticated and refined one) of 19th century Meat Extracts and
20th-century stock cubes....Hannah Glasse (1747) gave two recipes, one lifted from an earlier
work...Both state that a piece of the  'Glew' the size of a walnut is enough for a pint of water. The
second recipe, listing the various dishes and ways in which it can be used, could be translated
without great difficulty into  tips on use' to be printed on a modern stock cube or  'instant soup'
packet. Portable soup in its original form survived, at least in recipe books, into the 19th century.
How many travellers actually carried it around in their pockets or in little tin boxes, as
recommended, is a question which seems unlikely ever to receive a satisfactory answer."<br>
---<i>Oxford Compantion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 625)
<p>
<b>How did they make pocket soup?</b><blockquote>
<b>[1694]<br>
"To Make Veal Glew</b><br>
Take a Leg of Veal & when ye [the] fat is cut clean off, make a very strong broth of it & strain it thro a fine sieve that it may
be clear. When this is done ot ye broth into a bread flat stew pan that will hold it all, & set it on a high Chaffindish of Charkcoal,
& stir it continually about that it may neither burn nor boyle ye whole time 'tis on ye fire, which must be about seven
hours. After you set it by in your pan for a day or two, then put it out & scrape off the settlement if any. Put ye clean jelly into a China Dish & 
into a China Dish & place it in a Stewpan of hot Water, placing it on a Chaffin of Charkcoal; then ye hot water in ye pan must be kept boyling, till by ye steam ye
jelly grow of a Glewish substance, which it will do in two or three yours.--Your may know when it is done enough by putting a Little
by to be cold, & if 'twill cut like a soft cheese it is as it could be.--Put it into little sweetmeat pots till it is quite cold; then 
you may take it out & wrap it in flanell & afterward in paper & it will keep many years.--A piece ye bigness of a Nutmeg will make half
a pint of broth. The whole Leg of Veal, unless very large, will not make on make a piece of Glew gibber than your hand. It is
made into broth by pouring hot Wate of it."<br>

<p>
<b>[1747]<br>
"To make Pocket Soop.</b><br>
Take a Leg of Veal, strip off all the Skin and Fat, then take all the muscular or fleshy Parts clean from the BOnes. Boil this Flesh
in three or four Gallons of Water till it comes to a strong Jelly, and that the Meat is good for nothing. Be sure to keep the Pot close covered, and not
do too fast; take a little out in a Spoon now and then, and when you find it is a good rich Jelly, strain it through a Sieve into a clean earth Pan. 
When it is cold, take off all the Skim and Fat, strain it through a Sieve into a clean earthen Pan. When it is cold, take off all the Skim and Fat from 
the Top, then provide a large deep Stew-pan with Water boiling over a Stove, then take some deep China-cups, or well glazed Earthen
Ware, and fill theses Cups with the Jelly, which you must take clear from the Settling at the Bottom, and set them in the Stew-pan of Water. 
Take great Care none of the Water gets into the Cups; if it does, it will spoil it. Keep the Water boiling gently all the time, till the Jelly becomes
thick as Glew; then take them out, and let thems tand to cool; then turn the Glew out into some new coarse Flannel, which draws out all
the Moisture; turn thenm in six or eight Hours on fresh Flannel, and so do until they are quite dry. Keep it in a dry warm Place,
and in a little time it will be like a dry hard Piece of Glew, which you may carry in your Pocket, without getting any Harm.
 The best Way is to put it into little Tin boxes. When you use it, boil about a Pint of Water, and pour it on a 
Piece of Glew about as big as a small Walnut, stirring all the time till it is melted. Season with Salt to your Palate; and if you chuse any
Herbs, or Spice, boil them in the Water first, then pour the Water over the Glew."
<p>
<b>"To make Portable Soop.</b><br>
Take two Legs of Beef, about fifty Pounds Weight, take off all the Skin and Fat as well as you can, then take all the Meat and 
Sinews clean from the Bones, which Meat put into a large Pot, and put to it eight or nine Gallons of soft Water; first make it boil, then put in twelve 
Anchovies, an Ounce of Mace, a Quarter of an Ounce of Cloves, an Ounce of whole Pepper black and white together, six large Onions
peeled, and cut int two, a little Bundle of Thyme, Sweet Marjoram, and Winter-savory, the dry hard Crust of a Two-penny Loaf, stir it all
together, and cover it close, lay a Weight on the Cover to keep it close down, and let it boil softly for eight or nine 
Hours, then uncover it, and stir it together. Coer it close again, and let it boil till it is a very rich good Jelly, which you will know by
taking a little out now and then, and let it cool. When you find it is a thick Jelly, take it off and strain it through a coarse
Hair-bag, and press it hard; then strain it through a Hair-sieve int a large Earthen Pan, when it is quite cold, take off all the Skim and
Fat, and take the fine Jelly clear from the Settlings at Bottom, and put the Jelly into a large deep well-tinned Stew-pan. Set it over a 
Stove with a low Fire, keep stirring it often, take great Care it neither sticks to the Pan, or burns; and when you find the Jelly
is very stiff and thick, as it will be in Lumps about the Pan, take it out, and put it into large deep China-Cups, or well-glazed
Earthen Ware. Fill the Pan two Thirds full with Water, when the Water boils, set in your Cups, be sure no Water gets into the Cups, 
keep the Water boiling softly all the time, till you find the Jelly is like a stiff Glew; then take out the Cups, and when they are cool, thurn out the Glew into 
coarse new Flannel. Let it lay eight or nine Hours, keeping it in a dry warm Place, and turn it on fresh Flannel till it is quite dry, and thew Glew
wil be quite hard; then put it into clean new Stone-pots, keep it close coloured [covered] from Dust and Dirt, and in a dry Place, where
no Damp can come to it. When you use it, pour boiling Water on it, and stir it all the time till it is melted. Season it with Salt to your 
Palate; a Piece as big as a large Walnut, will make a Pint of Water very rich; but as to that you are to make it as good as you 
please; if for Soop, fry a French Rile and lay in the Middle of the Dish, when the Glew is dissolved in the Water, give it a
boil, and our it into a Dish; if you chuse it for Change, you may boil either Rice, Barley, or Vermicelli, Salary [celery]
cut small, Truffles or Morels; but let them be very tenderly boiled in the Water before your stir in the Glew, and then give it a boil all
together. You may, when you would have it very fine, add Force-meat Balls, Cock's Combs, or a Palate boiled very tender, and cut into 
little Bits; but it will be very rich and good without any of these Ingredients. If for Gravy, pour the boiling Water on what Quantity you think
proper; and when it is dissolved, add what Ingredients you please, as in other Sauces. This is only in the room of a rich good
Gravy; or you may make your Sauce either weak or strong, by adding more or less."<br>

<p>
<b>[1792]<br>
"Portable Soup</b><br>
Take three legs of veal and one of beef, with ten pounds of lean ham, all cut very small, put a quarter of a pound of butter at the
bottom of a large pot or cauldron, and the meat and ham in, with four ounces of anchovies, two ounces of mace, a bunch of celery,
 six carrots washed well, a large bunch of sweet herbs, a spoonful of whole pepper, and a hard crust of a penny loaf; sweat it over a 
slow fire till you find all the juices are drawn out of the meat, then cover it with boling water, and skim it well; let it boil gently
for four or five hours, then strain it off to settle, pour it into a pot, and boil it till it is a strong jelly, and as stiff
as glue, season it with Cayan pepper and salt, then pour it into little tin moulds; let it stand till cold, then turn it out
 on plates, and dry it in the sun, or at a great distance before the fire, keep turning it often till it is quite dry; then put it 
in tin boxes, with a piece of writing paper between each cake;  put them in a dry place for use. This is a very useful soup for travellers, or
large families; for by putting one small cake into a pint of boiling water, and giving it a boil up, it will make a pint of good soup;
or a little boiling water poured on a cake, will make a good gravy for a turkey or two fowls. It possesses one good quality, it
never loses any of its virtue by keeping."<br>
