<b>Ancient Celtic fare</b><br>
Much is known about what ancient Celtic foods, dining customs, and cooking methods:
<p>
"The eating and feasting habits of the Celts were recorded by a number of classical writers, the
most important of these being Posidonius, a Syrian Greek philosopher who in his Histories
provides eyewitness accounts of the Gauls in the 1st Century BC. Although his work does not
survive intact, it was an important sources of information for a number of later Greek writers,
notably Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC) and Athenaeus (fl. C. AF 200). Detailed accounts are
also found throughout the corpus of early medieval Irish saga literature, much of which is believed
to reflect Iron Age Celtic society. Athenaus, quoting Posidonious, describes the informal feasting
arrangements of the Celts as follows: 'the Celts place dried grass on the floor when they eat their
meals, using tables which are raised slightly off the ground.' The classical material indicates that
the feast was centered around the cauldron and roasting spits and was characterized by an
abundance of roasted and boiled meat, which were eaten with bare hands....the feast was a
ceremonial manifestation of the warfaring nature of society."<br>
---<i>Oxford Compantion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999
(p. 149-50)<br>
[NOTE: This book contains far more information than can be paraphrased here. It also cites
sources for further study. Your librarian can help you find a copy.]
<p>
"The Celts, like their predecessors, prepared their meat by roasting or stewing. Both methods
became easier after the introduction of metal utensils. Bronze, known in Britain from introduction
the middle of the second millennium BC, was for a long time used sparingly for weapons, knives
or jewelry. The inspiration for cauldrons of the meat came from the Greek trading colonies on the
French Mediterranean coasts. Their vessels of riveted sheet bronze were seen and copied by
itinerant Irish smiths about the eighth or seventh century BC. Soon cauldrons began to made in
Britain too, though there were rare at first and were probably reserved for ritual meals rather than
everyday use.  Metal had many practical advantages over pottery. The new containers could be
placed directly over the flames of a fire. They were not liable to be broken through over-heating
or by being accidentally dropped. They were even more hygienic, for they could be cleaned with
sand or ask and water more thoroughly than earthenware pots."<br>

<p>
<b>Meat:</b><br>
"Mealtimes among the Celts in Gaul were described by Posidonius (135-51 BC)...The diners sat
on the ground on straw or hides, and ate their meat with their fingers  in a cleanly by leonine
fashion, raising up whole limbs in both hands and biting off the meat, while any part that is hard to
tear off they cut through with a small dagger which hangs attached to their swordsheath in its own
scabbard'. They were waited upon by t heir older sons and daughters.   Beside them are hearths
blazing with fire, with cauldrons and spits containing large pieces of meat. Brave warriors they
honor with the finest portions of the meat.' The Celtic Iron Age saw the establishment of salt
working around Britain coasts. The salt helped to preserve meat for winter use, and especially the
pork so well loved by the Celts. The hams prepared by their neighbours in Gaul were exported to
Rome as a delicacy; but we know no details about the salted meats of Britain. According to an
Italian recipes of the mid-second century BC, hams had to be covered with salt and steeped in
their own brine for seventeen days, dried for two, rubbed over with oil and vinegar, and them
smoked for a further two days. It is likely that Celtic Britons followed similar practices, barring
the oil and vinegar dressing."<br>
---<i>Food and Drink in Britain</i> (p. 68)
<p>
"The Celts, who began to settle in Britain from the eighth century B.C., added hens, ducks, and
geese to the list of Britain's domeseticated animals. They refused to eat the wild horses and
instead tamed them for riding and for drawing wagons and chariots. The Celts were the first to
recognize that the soil of Britain is more fertile than that of continental Europe, and they cleared
forests to plant cereals and allow pasture to grow for grazing. They preserved meat, fish, and
butter in salt and exported British beef to the Continent. The Celts also tilled the soil so
successfully that they exported grain to many parts of Europe. In Britain, they built underground
grain storage silos. The Celts processed wheat by setting ears alight, then extinguishing the fire
when the husks were burnt. The wheat was then winnowed and baked, and saddle querns were
used to grind it into flour. These industrious farmers also began beekeeping, with conical hives
made from wickerwork daubed with mud or dung. They employed shallow earthenware pots as
drinking vessels, whereas deeper pots were made for cooking pottages (mixtures of meat, grains,
leaves, roots, and herbs) slowly over a fire. Honey and water, left together in a pot, will ferment,
and this drink--mead--was often flavored with wild herbs and fruits. Some cow, ewe, and goat
milk might have been drunk fresh, but most of it would have been made into cheese and only the
whey drunk. The Celts made an unhopped beer from barley and wheat, first allowing the grain to
germinate, then stopping this process with heat and allowing it to ferment. Finally, they also
imported wine and, later, began to grow vines themselves."<br>

[Cambridge University Press:Cambridge] 2000, Volume Two (p. 1217-8)<br>
[NOTE: page 1217 contains a summary of foods known in the British Isles prior to the Celts.
Presumably, these foods were also known to these peoples.]

Food history books skip from <a href="foodireland.html#celticfare">Ancient Celtic fare</a> to the late 17th century, when the Irish embraced
the potato. Surely, food did not stand still for centuries. "Irish Food Before the Potato," A.T. Lucas, <i>Gwerin: 
A Half-Yearly Journal of Folk Life</i>, Volume III, No. 2, 1960(p. 3-43) explores this period in depth. Information is

<b>Colcannon</b><br>
Food historians generally agree colcannon belongs to the Irish. This conclusion is based on
linguistic evidence, ingredient availability, and culinary preference. Combinations of potatoes,
cabbage, and leeks were also embraced by many other cultures and cuisines, most notably
Germany, Russia, France, Scotland, England. These hardy, economical, filling foods sated the
bellies of the working and poorer classes.
<p>
<a
herf="http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/plantanswers/publications/vegetabletravelers/cabbage.html"> Cabbages and their cousins</a> were known to ancient cooks.
They were thought to have several medicinal attributes. The Romans are said to have introduced
cabbages to Europe, with the possible exception of Ireland, where [According to C. Anne
Wilson/<i>Food and Drink in Britain</i>(1973)], linguistic evidence suggests it was already
known to
Iron Age Celts. In Medieval Europe cabbage/cole (often in combination with members of the
onion family) were the food of the common man. Potatoes were introduced to to Europe by 16th
century explorers. They were first regarded as curiosities, not readily embraced as food. The
French, then the Irish, were among the first to recognize the fact that potatoes could keep a
nation from starving. Recipes for potato and cabbage dishes were inevitable. These dishes
developed according to collective taste and culinary experience.
<p>
"Colcannon. Originally and Irish dish of boiled potatoes and cabbage or kale mashed together and
flavoured with onion, shallots, or leeks and cream or butter...The word  'colcannon' is from the
Gaelic  cal ceannann' which literally means white-headed cabbage. However, the  cannon' part of
the name might be a derivative of the old Irish  cainnenn', translated variously as garlic, onion, or
llek. Therefore it can be suggested that in its earliest form colcannon may have been a simple
mixture of some brassica and allium. One of the earliest Irish references to the dish as a mash of
potatoes and cabbages is found in the Diary of Wiliam Bulkely, of Bryndda, near Amlwch in
Anglesey, who made two journeys to Dublin in 1735...The dish was introduced into England in
the 18th century, where it became a favorite of the upper classes...In Ireland colcannon was
associated traditionally with Hallowe'en (31 October) festivities, when it was used for the
purposes of marriage divination. Charms hidden in bowls of colcannon were portents of a
marriage proposal should unmarried girls be lucky enough to find them, whilst others filled their
socks with spoonfuls of colcannon and hung them from the handle of the front door in the belief
that the first man through the door would become their future husband."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
203)
<p>
"There were variations, if rare, even that the poor ate. One was colcannon, or cale-cannon,
turnips or cabbage mashed up with potatoes and stewed. (A northern version, popular in county
Armagh, substituted beans for the turnips and cabbage.) Colcannon entered English usage in
1774, but the dish may be older. What is more certain is that colcannon was a treat--few cottagers
grew turnips or cabbages. That didn't stop it from becoming a delicacy, however, because the
peasants reportedly liked to steal the missing ingredients now and then. When Irish immigrants
came to the United States, they introduced colcannon to American cuisine."<br>

<b>Irish Stew</b><br>
The history of Irish stew, therefore, is truly a study of each ingredient. Onions were introduced by
the Ancient Romans. Potatoes were a new world food, introduced to the British Isles in the 16th
century, but not embraced until much later. The dating of "shepherd's pie" has similar notes.

"Irish stew is a celebrated Irish dish, yet its composition is a matter of dispute. Purists maintain
that the only acceptable and traditional ingredients are neck mutton chops or kid, potatoes,
onions, and water. Other would add such items as carrots, turnips, and pearl barley; but the
purists maintain they spoil the true flavour of the dish. The ingredients are boiled and simmered
slowly for up to two hours. Mutton was the dominant ingredient because the economic
importance of sheep lay in their wool and milk produce and this ensured that only old or
economically non-viable animals ended up in the cooking pot, where they needed hours of slow
boiling. Irish stew is the product of a culinary tradition that relied almost exclusively on cooking
over an open fire. It seems that Irish stew was recognized as early as about 1800..."<br>

<b>[1826]<br>
"764. Irish Stew</b><br>
Having taken the loose fat form a loin or neck of mutton, cut from three to four pounds of it into small well-shaped chops. 
Flatten and season them with salt and mixed spices. Peel six or eight onions; parboil and skin a quantity of potatoes. Lay
some shred suet at the bottom of a stew-pan, and a half-pint of broth, or melt two ounces of butter. Slice in a layer of
potatoes, then a layer of chops, then strew in the onions, then again the potatoes and chops, &c. and let the top be covered with 
potatoes. A shank or small bit of ham, or a scrape of smoked tongue, or a little sausage meat, is a great addition to this
favourite family dish. It must stove very slowly, and the pan must be closely and constatnly covered. Mshed potato makes an excellent
wholesome paste to cover plain meat-pies of all kinds, particuarly pies of fat meat.--Obs. Some cooks wrap an old napkin round the 
stew-pan lid, which forms a kind of luting in dressing this and othe stoved dishes. There is a kind of cottage oven used in 
Ireland, in form of a wide stew-pan, made of cast-irong, whith a lid of the same thickness, on which embers of turf are put. This is
placed over other embers, and an equal slow heat is maintained, which dresses a stew, baks a pudding or a bit of meat, and is found
very useful at other times as a cottage-pot. Hunter's pie is another excellent form of Irish stew, only this is sometimes made of
beef-collops instead of mutton-chops; and then the potatoes are always mashed. Place the potatoes, meat, and onions in alternate
layers in an earethen-ware pie-dish, andbake them; the top layer of potatoes ma be neatly scored, scollopped on the 
edges, and glazed with eggs, if approved. A fashionable Irish stew is baked in a mould, en casserole, and turned out when
served."<br>

<b>[1875]<br>
"Irish Stew.</b><br>
Take from two or three pounds of chops from the best end of a neck of mutton, and pare away
nearly all the fat, for an Irish Stew should not be greasy. If liked a portion of the breast may be cut
into squares and used, but a neck of mutton is the best joint for the purpose. Take as many
potatoes as amount after peeling to twice the weight of the meat. Slice them, and slice also eight
large onions. Put a layer of mixed potatoes and onions at the bottom of a stewpan. Place the meat
on this and season it plentifully with pepper and slightly with salt. Pack the ingredients closely,
and cover the meat with another layer of potato and onion. Pour in as much water or stock as will
moisten the topmost layer, cover the stewpan tightly, and let its contents simmer gently for three
hours. Be careful not to remove the lid, as this will let out the flavour."<br>

<b>Traditional Irish New Year food customs</b><p>

"New Year's Eve. The last night of the old year was known in Irish as Oiche na Coda Moire--The Night of the Big Portion--because of the belief that a big supper on this night ensured 
full and plenty for the year to come. No food should be taken out of the house on New Year's Eve. On any other night of the year a hungry traveler or homeless waif might expect 
hospitality as a matter of course, but on this night food and drink were given grudgingly, if at all. It was better not to ask. This custom went back to the time when the success or failure 
of the crops meant all the difference between famine and plenty. Spells and incantations were invoked to guard against the danger. It was customary of the woman of the house in many 
parts of the country to bake a large barm brack on New Year's Eve. As night approached the man of the house took three bites out of the cake and dashed it against the front door in the 
name of the Holy Trinity, expressing the pious hole that starvation might be banished from Ireland...After the ceremony of banishment was over the fragments of the cake were gathered 
up an eaten by the family. In Imokilly, Co Cork, they had a custom that the crumbs were thrown at the door and windows to prove that no one inside was hungry. A rather more pleasing 
version of this custom from west Limerick is given by Kevin Danaher in <i>The Year in Ireland</i>. The door was struck three times with a large cake while the head of the household recite...
'Happiness in and misfortune out From tonight to this night twelve months In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, Amen' Church bells ringing, hooters hooting, 
bonfires burning, people joining hands at midnight and singing 'Auld Lang Syne'--these are now the customary ways to welcome the New Year...New Year's Day was always known as 
La na gCeapairi--the Day of the Buttered Bread. This was possibly a talisman against hunger, or to show that food was plentiful. Sandwiches of bread and butter were placed outside the 
door on this morning."<br>---<i>Land of Milk and Honey: The Story of Traditional Irish Food and Drink</i>, Brid Mahon [Mercier Press:Boulder CO] 1991 (p. 146-148)
