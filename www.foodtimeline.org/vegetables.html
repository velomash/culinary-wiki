<font color="#003366"><b>Acorn squash</b></font><br>
Acorn squash (aka Des Moines Squash, Table Queen) is a New World winter squash that caught American print in the middle of the 19th century. Cooking tips show up in 
the 1920s. In the 1920s & 1930s acorn squash is introduced as a "newly marketed" vegetable. Why the popularity? The Acorn Squash is small and lends itself well
to baking, stuffing, soup, chips and bread. Minimal fuss; maximum flavor. And? It looks pretty on the plate.
<p>
"Acorn Squash. An American native--and one of the most familiar squashes in North America--the acorn squash (Curcubita pepo) 
is so called because it is shaped something like and acorn. It is a winter squash with a hard, ridged rind which makes it difficult 
to peel, but it is easily cut in half for stuffing and is excellent for baking. The acorn squash has a mild, nutty flavor and delivers a good 
deal of calcium (in view of its orange-colored flesh) surprisingly little beta-carotene." <br>

acorn squash, and it is shaped exactly like an acorn from an oak tree, only man times larger. It tastes like sweet potato when 
cooked, and is fine food. The grow to weigh seven or eight pounds, and the vine is very prolific. The vine is supposed to run on the 
gourd like a squash vine, but Mr. Haby says is vine got started up a mesquite tree in his neighbor's yard, and it is about to cover the 
tree and the acorns are hanging down from the vine. Housewives are always looking for something new to cook, and this may be found 
to suit the taste of some. He brought it form Arizona. Lampasas Leader."<br>

"A reader inquires if there is any way to keep pieces of squash from baking too hard or even burning on top when they are 
baked in an oven. Cut the squash in individual pieces and la cut side down on a pie tin. Then if the oven is not too hot, there will not 
be any hard crust over the piece of squash and, therefore, no waste of material. Acorn squash can be baked whole and thus avoid 
the crusty surface." <br>

of bread crumbs , melted butter, salt, pepper, a little lemon juice and nutmeg. Buttered cracker crumbs go on top and it's baked in a moderate oven until shell
is tender. Care should be taken not to cook it so soft as to spoil the decorative shape of this tiny squash. It's also halved, stemaed, the pulp scooped out, mixed
with chopped broiled oyster, and returned to shell."<br>

<a name="costmary">
<font color="#003366"><b>Costmary</b></font><br>
This problematic pot herb is puzzles food historians for several reasons. The fact that several authoritative food history reference books cite different botanical 
names for this plant is the first clue. Sources generally agree costmary is native to Western Asia, used in a medieval times to flavor ale (no specific place), introduced to England
in the 16th century, brought to the New World in colonial times, and is now rarely used. They also repeat, without reference to a specific source, that costmary is called the 
'Bible leaf,' because it was used as a book mark in that title. We librarians wonder, based on its costmary's flat shape and pungent odor, if the "Bible leaf" was 
used to mask mildew or other odors absorbed by damp paper.
<p>
Classical food historian Andrew Dalby helps us unpuzzle the confusion. He states:<br>
 "The translation 'costmary' for classical costus is erroneous. Costmary...is a medicinal herb introduced to European gardens from the Near East in medieval times. When added to ale it gave an 
aroma reminiscent of costus [Saussurea Lappa], hence its name, but it does not match the descriptions of costus in any other way."<br>
---<i>Food in the Ancient World From A to Z</i>, Andrew Dalby [Routledge:London] 2003 (p. 105)<br>
[NOTE: Mr. Dalby defines "Costus, or putchuk, aromatic root native to the mountains of Kashmir. This was one of the chief commodities of trade at successive port cities at the 
mouth of the Indus. Costus provided 'a burning taste and an exquisite scent' (so Pliny says) but was 'otherwise useless.' As Pliny knew well, costus was popular in 
Roman festivities...It was also much used in compound medicines,, and was an ingredient in spiced wines." (p. 105). Pliny reference is Natural History, Book XXXVII.]
<p>
Joseph Dommers Vehling's translation of <i>Apicius</i> [1936] states: "COSTUM, COSTUS, costmary; fragrant Indian shrub, the root of burning taste but excellent 
flavor." (p. 284). Apicius' recipe for Absinthium Romanum [Roman Vermouth] Rx3 calls for "costi scripulos senos," generally translated by moderns as costmary. 
<p>
<b>What is costmary?</b><br>
"Costmary--A plant that is native to Asia, was a popular herb in Ancient Greece, and has seen both past and present use in England, costmary (Chrysanthemum balsamita)-- with its leaves' hint
of lemon and mint flavorings--is employed to season poultry as well as stuffings, soups, salads, and sauces. It was naturalized, and now grows wild, in North America
 where it is known as 'Bible leaf' because its long, narrow leaves were used in former times as page markers in Bibles. Costmary has also been known in the past as 'alecost' because it was
used in the production of home-brewed ale."<br>
---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kenneth F. Kiple & Kriemhild Conee Ornelas [Cambridge University Press:Cambridge] 2000, Volume Two (p. 1763)
<p>
"Costmary (Tanacetum Balsamita)...a perennial plant which originated in W. Asia but achieved a wide distribution in Europe and was taken to N. America by early settlers...Its use in ale
is of historical interest only, and other roles of its pretty leaves, as in making tea or being added to salads, have largely disappeared. Although Joy Larkcom (1984)

Chrysanthemum Balsamica. Called Costmary, Sweet Mary, Bible Leaf, Alecost. French: Menthe de Notre Dame, Menthe romaine. German: Marienblatt, Bibelblatt, Marienbalsam. 
Italian: Erba Santa Maria, Erba Costa, Maria Santa. A perennial, costmary spreads from the underground parts & forms large clumps; the stiff, erect stems may reach a 
height of 4 feet; they have numerous short branches & are slightly downy. The leaves rare alternate, oval, lobed near the base, the largest over 6 inches long; the
 margins are crenate. The flower-heads are very small, yellow, & have several white ray-flowers. Variety tanacetoides has rayless heads...The leaves have a sweet, minty, lemony
flavor, and are used fresh like mint for flavoring tea and iced drinks; dried, they are used to make an infusion. Linens are perfumed with dried costmary, with or
without an admixutre of lavendar. The plant was used in medieval times for flavoring ale and beer. It is suitable for the garden border but tends to become sprawly or 
straggly late in the season. Costmary is propagated by division and by root cuttings. Seeds are seldom produced. Dry soil & full sun prove best to promote flowering, but
some shade is tolerated. A generous spacing, 3 to 4 feet, should be provided. Costmary is native to western Asia.<br>

name of crosne, which-according to legend, was also the name of a small town in France where the Chinese artichoke was introduced in 
1822. Chinese artichokes are usually boiled for a few minutes and then eaten as a cooked vegetable; they may also serve as an ingredient 
in other dishes, especially soups. Common names and synonyms: Crosne, Japanese artichoke Japanese potato." <br>

"Crosnes (pronounce krones) have many pseudonyms and are unsighltly difficult to grow and expensive. That being the case, New York chefs can't get enough of them...Diners
could be forgiven for not being familiar with crosnes. More obscurely known as knotroot, chorgi or stachys affinis, and more commonly referred to as Chinese or Japanese artichokes, crosnes derive their name
from Crosne, a town south of Paris where they were planted in 1882 by an agronomist who had brought them from Japan. Crosnes which average an inch in length, are similar to water chestnuts in 
texture. The French variety tastes a bit like potato. The American variety is smaller and nuttier. The delicate flavor suggests jimama or Jerusalem artichoke. Unlike most tuvers, 
crosnes stay crunchy when cooked...For the cook, they are impossible to peel and annoying to clean...Nevertheless, home cooks who like a challenge (or an adventure) can buy crosnes for $15.50
a pound...Crosnes are often compared to Jerusalem artichokes but they have nothing to do with artichokes of any nationality. They belong to the mint family, though the resemblance
is only above ground. The crosne plant looks like mint, but its leaves have no flavor...Crosnes were popular in Europe until the 1920's, when they fell out of food fashi
on.
They reappeared around 10 years ago when 'all those roots like rutabaga and Jersulaem artichokes were coming back...Inventive chefs are
moving far beyond the classic Larousse recipe of boiling them slightly and adding lots of butter...Most chefs serve crosnes in small
doses, as accents to raw or cooked dishes. John Schaefer, executive chef at Gramercy Tavern, pickles them for a salad and roasts them with
chicken and other root vegetables. David Bouley serves them with halibut and mushrooms at Bouley and with braised shrimp and 
pumpkinseeds at Danube. But Mr. Dupuy of La Caravelle puts crosnes center stage, turing them into a confit with olive oil and herbs. The
chef at Alias on the Lower East Side, Anthony Rose, prepares them as creative side dishes, sometimes with chicken stock, butter and
mint; sometimes with pork belly; sometimes in a red-wine sauce."<br>

Eggplants are the perfect
edible medium for exploring the human story of agriculture, technology, immigration, politics, economics, linguistics  and taste.
<p>
<b>Origin & early diffusion</b><br>
"Aubergine (or eggplant), the name used in North America), Solanum molongena, botanically a fruit but
usually counted as a vegetable. It originated in India, and is now grown in suitable climates
worldwide...Although the aubergine is believed to be of Indian origin, the first surviving mention of its is in
a Chinese work on the agriculture of the 5th century AD, the Tsi Min Yao Shu. Augergines soon became
popular throughout Asia and the Near East, since their mild flavour and spongy texture suited them for
many combinations with other vegetables and meat. The arrived in Europe both through the invasion of
the Moors and by means of Italian trade with the Arabs, which became important in the 13th century...For
a long time Europeans considered the aubergine inedible, gave it insulting names, and grew it only as an
ornamental plant. But during the 15th century it gradually gained acceptance. By 1500 its was well enough
known for the early Spanish and Portuguese colonists to take it to America, where it grew well and
became a popular vegetable, which it still is...Back in Europe, the aubergine has for some time been firmly
established regional cuisines...The most famous aubergine dish, eaten all over the Arab world, is called
Imam bayildi--'the priest fainted'... This consists of aubergines stuffed with onions...and cooked with olive
oil...In India, Iran, and Afghanistan, aubergines are made into a hot pickle..."<btr>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 39-40)
<p>
<b>Why do we call it "eggplant?"</b><br>
"Used in present-day English chiefly by America speakers as a synonym for the aubergine, eggplant was originally applied
specifically to the white-skinned, egg-shaped variety of the vegetable. This was in the mid-eighteenth century (available evidence suggests that the
term predates aubergine by about 30 years). By the middle of the nineteenth century eggplant had come to be used for the purple-skinned
aubergine, and subsequently over the past hundred years, the split between American and British usage has developled."<br>

<b>Eggplant symbolism & lore</b><br>
"The egglant belongs to the nightshade family, and although most foods in the nightshade family (such as
potatoes and tomatoes) oringated in the Americas, the eggplant comes from India and Southeast Asia,
where it grew in a variety of forms and colors. The eggplants that first reached northern Europe were not
purple like the common eggplants today, but white or yellow, somewhat like swans' eggs. Because
eggplants were nighshades and because people believed the purple bulbous kind resembled mandrakes
more closely than eggs, these foods suffered a lack of respect for a long time. Mandrakes, like most
nightshades, were poisonous, so at one time, people thought that eggplants made those who ate them
insane. The myths and legends surrounding eggplant substantiated the fears the people had of eating
them. Some scholars have identified eggplants as the Dead Sea fruit of the Bible and of John Milton's
Paradise Lost, in which fallen angels wandered by the Dead Sea in hunger and found purple fruits that
looked delicious, but upon eating them discovered that the pulp of the fruit turned to ashes. This strange
legend may have ahd a factual basis. Eggplants indeed grew along the Dead Sea near Sodom, the biblical
city of sinners that God destroyed, and while the eggplants of Sodom appeared plump and ripe on the
outside, an insect invaded the inside, causing the pulp to decay and create a powdery substance inside
the seemingly perfect skin. Farmers later learned what destroyed these fruits and how to combat the
insect infestations; but early on, people could only speculate on the cause. They knew that God reduced
the evil city of Sodom to ashes, so they easily attributed a similar evil to the ash-producing fruits they
found growing there."<br>

<b>Indian eggplant (brinjal)</b><br>
"The Sanskrit words vrntaka and vartaka may be of earlier Munda origin, and the brinjal (Hindi baingan, Portuguese bringella, 
English eggplant or aubergine) may have originated from a wild ancestor in Inda by human selection for reduced spininess and
bitterness, bigger fruit size and annual habit. The borinjal comes in a variety of shapes and sizes (small and globular, large and 
long) and colours (purple, green, yellowish, white,s triped) and is found abundantly all over India. The many ways in which it can be cooked are well 
illustrated in the historical literature of Kannada. Thus brinjal could be seasoned with ghee, roasted on live coals and
mashed into a baji (bartha); or cut into small piecesa and cooked with jaggery. Yet again, the brinjal could be fried along with 
rice grits and chopped onions, wrapped in a turmeric leaf, and steamed to give a pude, a generic dish. An uncooked dish consisted of a 
brinjal mash with coconut shreds and curry leaves, flavoured with asafoetida and cardamom. In Bengal, wedges of brinjal are spiced and
lightly fired, and it can form part of a bitter shukto dish. Brinjals stuffed with their own mashed and spiced contents, or whith spiced minced
meat (a dish called purabhattaka in the Manasollasa of AD 1130) and then shallow-fried are delicacies everywhere..."<br?

<b>Chinese eggplant</b><br>
"Eggplant...was domesticated in India or Southwest Asia. The Persians seem to have introduced it from India to 
Africa, and the Arabs to Spain...In early China it was sometimes called 'Malayan melon' or 'Malayan purple melon'...suggesting
that it may have been introduced from Southeast Asia. It was cultivated in what is now Kwangtung in the fourth century A.D....
Though the eggplant is oftgen regarded as an annual, it is in fact a perennial which, where not killed by frost, can grow into
a stroung plant up to eight feet high. Apparently in early Kwangtung it was grown as a perennial known as the 'eggplant tree,' and it 
continued to be grown in this way at least until the seventeenth century...Several varieties of eggplant were found in
traditional China, and they contrasted in shape, color, and date of maturity...Even in early China several varieites seem to have been
known, including one with fruit 'the size of a marble.' They were eaten raw or cooked and, as in later times, may have been 
pickled as well...China has a considerable varierty in its eggplant dishes, both in ways of preparation (steamed, boiled, fried, or
otherwise) and flavorings...Eggplant may also be served in cold dishes such as steamed or boiled 'Eggplant Salad,' a dish of both
today and of the Ch'ing dynasty court...It may also be pickled..."<br>

<b>Eggplant in Europe</b><br>
"The humbel eggplant has been intgroduced...into northern France by Louis XIV...Louis CIV liked to see rare and unknown foods on his table, and
Jean de la Quintinie, in charge of the royal kitchen gardens gratified him by being the first to grow eggplant in northern
France...[Eggplant] seems to have been cultivated first in Spain by the Moors of Andalusia, for it was the Arabs who imported it originally from
the distant East. It has been cultivated in Italy since the fifteenth century, reagech England late in the sixteenth and became grenerally known in 
northern France, following the lead of Louis XIV, in the seventeenth. It cannot be said that it was received with wild enthusiams anywhere. 
Though in Italy it appeared on the menu of a banquet given by Pope Pius V in 1570, it has never attained in that country the gastronomic peaks
 it has reached in the Middle East. When it turned up in England, John Gerard advised the readers of his 1597 <i>Herball</i> 'raterh...to
content themselves with the meate and sauce of our owne country than with fruit and sauce eaten with such perill; for doubtless these apples
 have a mischevious quality; the use therof is utterly forsaken.' In France, the eggplant was described as having  'fruit as large as pears, but with bad
qualities.'...under the Directory (1795) it suddenly became a fad with the <i>incroyables</i> (hippies?) and the <i>merveilleuses</i>
(the beautiful people), who wolfed down slices of grilled eggplant at their disorderly gathering place, the garden of the Palais
Royal."<br>

century. Eggplant many have been introduced to America by African slaves. According to one story, the
eggplant was introduced to America by Thomas Jefferson...Despite having arrived in the Americas with or
soon after the first European settlers, eggplant is often considered an ethnic food...William Woys Weaver
notes that Americans have been slow to expand their taste for eggplant...The eggplant is most commonly
assciated with foods of the Far East, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean, although many of these
foods have become commonplace in America. Eggplant parmesean is an Italian favorite in America."<br>

<font color="#003366"><b>Fiddlehead ferns</b></font><br>
According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, fiddlehead, as it relates to food is a local name for a young fern frond. First print reference was 1882.
 Crozier, is a curled top of a young fern. Print references date to 1831. A crozier or crosier is also the crooked pastoral rod of a shepherd or bishop. The 
connection between the latter term and unfurling fern fronds makes visuals sense. <i>The Random House Unabridged Dictionary</i>, (2nd edition newly revised, 1993) 
defines fiddleheads as young coiled fronds of various species of ferns, eaten as vegetables. This source dates the term to 1790-1800 but does not provide 
citations or references.  Molly ONeill states: Fiddleheads are a growth stage, not a species. Since colonial times, they have been gathered along the 
mid-Atlantic. [Talking Fiddleheads, Molly ONeill, <i>New York Times</i>, May 1, 1994 (p. SM69).] 
 <p>
 
<b>Why fiddlehead?</b> Our survey of historic newspapers suggests it is because the unfurled fronds resemble the shape of a violin (aka fiddle).

Fiddlehead fern. All ferns are fiddleheads when their new, tightly coiled, green shoots emerge from the earthusually in the spring. After they uncoil into 
fronds, they are no longer edible, ands as with certain mushrooms, they are questions about the edibility of some of the so-called fiddleheads which are suspected of 
being carcinogenic. However, the one usually marketedthe ostrich fern (Matteuccia struthiopteris)is supposed to be safe. Fiddleheads grown in damp places and in 
North America are sought mostly in forests along the eastern seaboard, especially in New Brunswick, Maine, and Vermont. For some, their taste is akin to that of 
artichokes; for others, it is more like the flavor of asparagus. Although they are often added raw to salads, fiddleheads are best when (as with asparagus or
 artichoke hearts) they are lightly boiled and served with melted butter or some other appropriate dressing. The nutrients provided are vitamins A and C. Common 
names of synonyms: Fiddleheads(s), fiddlehead greens, ostrich fern.<br>

 Most beautiful of all are the fiddleheads of the cinnamon fern (Osmunda cinnamomes), sometimes known as the fiddlehead fern. Once you have seen a cluster of these 
wooly crosier, you will never forget them. The sturdy stems and the unfurling fronds are covered with a dense growth of fine, pale yellow-buff hair that changes to 
cinnamon brown on the fertile fronds. Though the crosiers of the well known and popular Christmas fern (Polyystichum acrostichldes) are similar to those of the 
cinnamon fern, they are silver-haired and more slender. The crosiers arise among the deep green fronds from the previous years growth of this evergreen fern. In 
early spring before blossome [sic] time, the delicately cut foliage of some flowering plants may be mistaken for fern fronds. Unless the tips of the leaves are 
curled, the plants are not ferns. The primitive succulent fernsgrape ferns and rattlesnake ferns (botrychium) are folded rather than curled in the bud. The young 
leaves or fronds of all other ferns are held in a tight coil for safety as the stems push through the ground. The fronds slowly unfurl as the stem lengthens.<br>

<b> How to pick fiddlehead ferns.</b> Fiddlehead ferns are the tip ends of the common ostrich fern, which grows in the woods and along various woodland borders. The ferns 
should be gathered when the fresh shoots have started to develop in the spring. Pluck off the top, curved tip of the fern. Rinse well under cold running water.<br>
<b>How to cook fiddlehead ferns.</b> Cook the ferns in boiling salted water to cover for three to four minutes. When cooked, they should be tender but crisp. Drain 
and serve hot with melted butter and lemon or chill and serve with French dressing as a salad. They are good, too, on toast rounds with cream cheese or mayonnaise.<br
<b>How to freeze fiddlehead ferns.</b> When the fern tips are gathered and rinsed under cold water, boil or steam them for exactly one minute. Drain and dry on paper 
toweling. Arrange them on cooky sheets and freeze.. When frozen, empty them into freezer containers and store.<br>

were prserved and consumed throughout the year. Like so many of our foods, there is confusion over the origin of the pea, which may have occurred in central or southern
Asia or in the Middle East...wild forms must have been tasty seasonal items on the menus of the hunter-gatherers, and peas were among the first plants to be domesticated--
about 8,000 years ago...after which they spread quickly to the Mediterranean region and to India and China. Peas were an important food of the Egyptians, Greeks, and
Romans...In the sixteenth century, tender varities of green pease (designed to be eaten fresh) entered the diet as the mange-tout or sugar pea was developed in 
Dutch gardens, and petits pois became a part of French cuisine...peas have made their way with the earliest settlers to the New World...in 1870 it was among the first to

In 21st century USA , Quinoa enjoys superfood status. Definately nutritious, decidedly exotic and demonstratably economical.
What exactly is this high Andean Peruvan plant? Botanically, it's an herb offering both vegetable and grain culinary 
options. 
Contemporary American recipes generally promote quinoa as a superfood grain alternative. This is true on a basic level.
Quinoa subs in nicely for traditional grain recipes (pasta, rice, couscous, &c.). USA commercially packed quinoa granules
promote the grain potential (especially to gluten-free consumer market base) but fail to disclose the full plant's potential: most 
notably greens used for salad & vegetable purpose.

<b>Origins & Inca foodways</b><br> 
"Quinoa...Pronounced 'keen-wah, quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) is an annual herb of the tropical American highlands and a native 
of Chile and Peru. Also known as quinua and sometimes as 'goosefoot,' quinoa is and historically has been the most important of the 
cultivated chenopods. Like amaranth, it is technically not a grain, meaning that it is not one of the cultivated grasses. Also like amaranth, quinoa helped sustain 
a great American civilization--in this cakes the Incas. After maize, it was the most utilized grain in the Andes region at the time of the Spanish conquest. It was 
used to make beer (chica) as well as soups, stews, and porridges, and its leaves were employed as a potherb. Quinoa does well in poor 
soils at high altitudes...Quinoa is cultivated today throughout the Andes from Ecuador to Bolivia and at one time was grown in England, 
where the leaves were consumed as greens and the seeds given to poultry. It is superior to the true grains in nutritional 
quality..."<br>

<b>Culinary applications</b><br> 
"Another favorite of our South American neighbors is a cereal which is all their own, and a very fine one at 
that, even if it is a member of the Pigweed Family. This plant, known as quinoa, goosefoot, or Incan arrow, 
is a native of the highlands of Peru and Chile and thrives best at an altitude of from 12,000 to 15,000 above 
the sea where few other food-plants or cereals grow. For several thousand years the quinoa has been 
cultivated by the Indians of the Andes, until today the best varieties grow to six feet or more in height and 
bear an abundance of edible seeds. These are round a flat, looking a good deal like small lentils, and are 
slightly glutinous, and very nutritious. They are ground into meal and flour and are used to making bread, 
cakes, in soups, and in the preparation of the native beverage known as chica. The quinoa meal and flour 
tastes somewhat like buckwheat, but with a hint of pea-flavor, and cakes or bread made from the cereal are 
excellent and a most welcome change from wheat or corn. In Chile, where the plant is extensively 
cultivated, the flour from the seeds is usually mixed with wheat flour for baking bread. In addition to 
providing a splendid cereal food, the quinoa furnished the natives with delicious "greens" which are made 
from the young leaves of the valuable plant, while finally, the Indians claim that an infusion of the seeds is a 
certain cure for tuberculosis. But even if their faith of the curative properties of the quinoa seeds is not 
wholly warranted, the "cereals" prepared from them would prove most valuable additions to our menus. If 
present plans in Chile and Peru mature, and quinoa is grow on a large commercial scale, it may note be very 
long before we in the North are breakfasting on this find cereal from the far-off Andes."<br>

"Quinoa is a high-protein grain that was virtually unknown to people outside South America until recent years. The grain grew 
wild in the South American highlands thousands of years ago. People living in the area around Lake Titicaca began cultivating it 
around 5800 to 4500 B.C. For thousands of years, millions of people in the Andean region relied on quinoa to fulfill their 
nutritional needs, and they revered the grain as a god-given food. In Quechua myth, a sacred bird, the turtledove, or killku, 
delivered quinoa to the people...When the Inca came to rule the Peruvian Andes, they too relied on quinoa as a nutritional 
staple and held it sacred. They called it "mother grain," and they made it the focus of sacred rituals performed in worship 
of their sun god."<br>

"A plant that could have a trial in the agriculture of California is the quinoa...a cereal indigenous in the higher districts of Peru and extensively 
cultivated there before and since the Spanish conquest. The grain prepared for the table in various ways similar to the methods of cooking beans, 
is regarded by the Peruvians and by many travelers as a delicacy. It was tried in German on a small scale and was cultivated with success, but 
did not give satisfaction on the table. Tschuli, from whose book of travels in Peru I learn from these facts, says: 'It is to be hoped that the 
cultivation of the quinoa will become general in Europe, for the plant would be a great utility in districts where the potato rot prevails. We all know 
that potatoes and tea when first introduced in Europe were found very offensive to the palate by may people who afterward accepted them 
gratefully. Like them there is reason to believe that the quinoa will become an article of food consumed by many civilized nations.'"<br>

the most important article of food in the inhabitants of New Granada, Peru and Chile at the time of the discovery of 
America, and at the present day is still extensively cultivated on account of its seeds, which are used extensively by 
the poorer inhabitants. There are several varieties, of which the white is cultivated in Europe as a spinach plant, rather
 than for its seeds. However prepared, the seed, says Thompson, is unpalatable to strangers. Gibbon, who saw the plant 
in Bolivia, says that when boiled like rice and eaten with milk, the seeds are very savory. Seeds from France but 
originally from Peru, were distributed from the United States patent Office in 1854. Garcilasso de la Vega says it was 
called quinua by the natives of Peru and mujo by the Spaniards. he says: 'Both the Indians and the Spanish eat the tender
 leaf in their dishes, because they are savory and very wholesome. They also eat the grain in the soups, prepared in
 various ways.' A black-seeded variety, cultivated in gardens, is mentioned by Feuille, in Peru, preceding 1725. It was introduced into France in 1785 but has not had very extended use. Molina says in Chile there is a variety called dahue by the Indians which has greyish leaves and produces a white grain. The grain of the quinua serves for making a very pleasant stomachic beverage; that of dahue, on being boiled, lengthens out in the form of worms and is excellent in soup. The leaves are also eaten and are tender and of an agreeable taste."<br>

I like to prepare it in in very simple ways (pilafs, taboulleh-type salads and stuffed peppers, for instance) so as not to eclipse its charms.

"Quinoa, the tiny ivory-colored seed, has been recently introduced to the American market. High in protein--an average of 16.2 percent compared with 14 
percent for wheat--it represents a better balance of amino acids than wheat, according to Eugene Anderson, professor of anthropology at the University 
of California at Riverside. The seed is particularly rich in the amino acid lysine, which is difficult to obtain from vegetable sources. The calcium content of 
uncooked quinoa (pronounced KEEN-wah, from the Spanish) is the same as an equal quantity of low-fat milk, but with four times as much phosphorus. It is 
also a good source of B vitamins and vitamin E. Native to the high Andes of South America, quinoa has been rediscovered as one of the 'heritage' foods that 
sustained native American populations before the arrival of Europeans. As such, it joins New Mexican blue corn, the sacred train of the Hopis used to make 
silvery paper-thin piki bread, which has successfully made the great leap from the Southwestern reservation to the trendy California kitchens. It's too early 
to tell if quinoa will catch on in this fashion. The new seed is not merely nutritionally good. Cooked briefly in water, quinoa fluffs up, quadrupling in 
size, but retains a crunchiness approaching a cross between short-grain rice and bulgur. Because the delicately nutty flavor is unassertive, the cooked 
grain can be used in salads, as a main-dish casserole, a quick substitute for couscous with a meat or vegetable stew, a seasoned curried pilaf, a side dish 
when mixed with pesto or other herbs, a stuffing for poultry or vegetables or even dessert. Quinoa is delicate enough to serve with fish yet can be robustly seasoned to accompany a 
hearty beef stew, and recooking it, in a sauce for example, will not affect its texture...Quinoa, sold in health food stores and specialty shops...is

 that is yellow-colored rather than white...Rutabagas spread from Sweden to central Europe and
 the northern regions of Italy, where in medieval times they were called "Swedes" and
 housewives were advised to accept only those that were garden-fresh...Rutabagas were
 cultivated prior to 1650 in Bohemia, and in 1755 they were introduced to England and Scotland
 from Holland, where they were initially referred to as "turnip-rooted cabbage," "Swedes," or
 "Swedish turnips." American gardeners were growing rutabagas by 1806, and today, Canada--along with the states of Washington and Oregon--supplies the United States with rutabagas,
 which explains their often being called "Canadian turnips" by Americans. Two of the best-known
 rutabaga types are  'Laurentian' and the "Purple-Top Yellow."<br>

 "Swede. The humble and lubrigious swede, orange-fleshed cousin of the turnip, was introduced
 into Scotland in 1781 from Sweden--hence the name, orginally Swedish turnip, and by the early
 nineteenth century swede. It was hailed with enthusiasm as a replacement for the ordinary
 turnip--the Encyclopedia Britannica (1791) announced that the  Swedish turnip is a plant form
 which great expectations have been formed'--and while it has not subsequently set the world on
 fire, it has remianed part of the standard vegetable repertoire of Britain, and particularly of
 Scotland. There it is often called turnip or neep, the old word for  'turnip': a dish of mashed neeps,
 or pureed swede, is a traditional accompaniment of haggis. The Americans, meanwhile, usually
 refer to it as rutabaga, orginally a Swedish dialect terms meaning "baggy root."<br>
  ---<i>An A-Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 330-1)<br>
[NOTE: The Rutabaga entry in this book tells us the original Swedish term is "rotobagga."]
<p>
"Swede and rutabaga, two names for a root vegetable, Brassica napus ssp rapifera, which is closely related to but
botanically and commerically disinguishsed from the turnip. Swedes differ from turnips in having ridged scars forming concentric
rings aroung their tops. The 'root' is not a true root but the swollen base of the stem, and theses marks are leaf scars.
The swede probably originated in C. Europe and reached France and then England in the 17th century. By the late 18th century it had become
an important European vegetable crop; and by the beginning of the 19th century it had reached the USA...
The word 'rutabaga' is a corruption of the Swedish dialect term rota bagge,--'red bags', referring to the bulbous shape...
In Scotland they are called 'neeps; (a contraction of 'turneeps', and searly form of 'turnips')."<br>

"Swede or Swedish turnip (Brassica napo-brassica), a plant whose large round roots, with their yellow or white flesh, resemble
turnips. They are used mainly for cattle food in northern Europe, except in the British Isles where they are a well-known
vegetable. Swede may be cooked in any way that is suitable for turnip. Swede is known by several names: Russian turnip, rutabaga,
 and turnip-rooted cabbage. In Ireland, however, it is called turnip, the true turnip being known there as 'white' turnip, and it is
prepared by first boiling it, then mashing with butter, pepper, and a pinch of cinnamon or mace."<br>

"Rutabaga of the Swedes, the navet de Suede, or chou de Suede, or chou rutabaga, or chou navet jaune, of the French was introduced
to England somewhere about the end of the eighteenth century. In the Maine Farmer of May 15, 1835, a correspondent, John Burton, states that the
rutabaga, swedish turnip, or Lapland turnip--for by all these names it was known--was introduced to this country since the 
commencement of the present century. Six or more varieties are named in all seed catalogs of and Burr describes 11 kinds. The
rutabagas of our gardens include two forms, one with white flesh, the other with yellow. The French call these two classes chou-navets and
rutabagas respectively...In 1806 the distinction was retained in the United States, McMahon describing the turnip-rooted cabbage and the 
Swedish turnip, or Rutabaga...The first description of the white-rooted form is by bauhin in his Prodromus, 1620, and it is named
again in his Pinax, 1623, and is called napo-brassica. In 1686, Ray apparently did not know it in England, as he quotes Bauhin's name
 and description, which states that it is cultivated in Bohemia and is eaten, but Morrison, in 1669, catalogs it among the plants in the
royal gardens. In France, it is named by Tournfort, in 1700, Brassica radice napiformi, or chou-navet. In 1778, this was called in England turnip-cabbage...
There are three varieties described by Vilmorin...The rutabaga is said by Sinclair, in the account of the system of husbandry in 
Scotland, to have been introduced into Scotland about 1781-2, and a quotation in the Gardeners' Chronicle says it was introduced into 
England in 1790. It is mentioned in 1806 by McMahon as in American gardens, and in 1817 there is a record of a acre of this
crop in Illinois. The vernacular names all indicate an origin in Sweden or northern Europe. It is called Swedish turnip or Roota-baga by
McMahon, 1806, by Miller's Dictionary, 1807...The foreign names given by Don in 1831 include...the Italian navone di 
Laponia."<br>

"198. Turnips. Pare off all that would be hard, woody, and stringy when boiled. Boil them in plenty of water, for from three-quarters
 of an hour to nearly two hours, according to the age and size. Drain and serve them whole, or, if too large, divided, or mahsed. A bit of the
green top shoot is left on young turnips and on Swedish turnips. Swedish turnip-tops are very delicate greens when young. If boiled in their
coats, and then pared, turnips will be more juicy."

"Turnips. We have in common use two varities, the rutabaga, yellow or Swedish turnup (Brassica campestris, Linn.), and the
white turnip (Brassica rapa, Linn.). In chemical composition the turnip is very much like the cabbage, except that it contains more
water and lessnutritious matter. It odes not contain either sugar or starch. The carbohydrates present are in the form of inulin and pectose, which make them
an agreeable and harmless begetable for diabetic patients. Turnip tops, or sprouts of old turnips, may be used in salads or boiled as greens.

<b>Mashed turnips & carrots?</b><br>

Mashed turnips & carrots is my mother-in-law's signature dish. Born in 1927 (Cornwall Ontario Canada) with Scottish heritage. Family dishes were thrifty and
 frugal. The perfect convergence of Scottish values and the Great Depression. Mashed turnips (really rutabagas) & carrots with butter, garlic, pepper & parsley is a
 required element on Olver Thanksgiving tables. But? We do not know the origin or history of this dish. It just is & it is delicious! 
<p>
Turnips (rutabagas, Swedes) are traditionally grouped on the lower end of the human food spectrum. Carrots grace tables of all classes. Carrots also bring color 
and sweetness to the otherwise bland turnip. Thinking? The ability to add carrots to this mashed mix signaled aspiring class status. 
If your family/traditions come from places other than Canada/UK let us know (where). Happy to investigate.
