<b>Need to plan a "decade" food event?</b><br>
This is a very doable project. Once you figure out what you want to accomplish, the rest will fall
in place.<ol>
<li><b>Determine your focus</b><br>
---1980s formal dinner? 1960s backyard barbecue? 1950s Vegas resort extraganza? 1940s teen party? 1920s Gatsby speakeasy
evening? Victorian garden party?
<li><b> Decide if you want to feature local fare</b><br>
---1900s Texas chili parlors? 1930s Chicago soup kitchens? 1970s California cuisine? 1990s
Seattle cafes? 
<li><b>If you think it's best to stick with "signature" decade foods everyone will recognize, start
here:</b></ol>
<ul>
<li><i>Fashionable Foods: Seven Decades of Food Fads</i>, Sylvia Lovegren
[McMillan:NewYork] 1999 <br>
---excellent for social context, commentary, & selected recipes: 1920s-1980s
<li><i>Century in Food: America's Fads and Favorites</i>, Beverly Bundy [Collector

</ul>
<p>
<b>If you want to identify period recipes, menus, table settings & decorations</b><br>
This is the fun part! It's also time-consuming and labor-intensive. You need primary resources.
These are:
<p><dl>
<dt><b>Cookbooks</b>
<dd>Period cookbooks are the best sources for authentic recipes, menu suggestions, table
settings and serving tips. Unfortunately, most public libraries do not own old cookbooks. Ask
your librarian for help. Period cookbooks can be identified with the <a
href="http://catalog.loc.gov">Library of Congress catalog</a> and state or city library catalogs</a>. Your librarian can
help you identify nearby libraries with historic culinary collections or try to borrow them.
<dt><b>Magazines</b>
<dd><i>Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature</i>, Wilson <br>
The librarians at your local public library can help you with this. Use the subject headings
"menus" "meals" and "dining" to locate articles printed in popular magazines such as the
<i>Ladies Home Journal</i>, <i>Family Circle</i>, <i>Good Housekeeping</i>, <i>American
Home</i>,  <i>Better Homes and Gardens</i>, and <i>Southern Living</i>. Your librarian can
help you obtain the articles you need. Even better? Find a library that owns these magazines for
the decade you want. Browse them for recipes, food ads, table decorations, and party tips.
<dt><b>Local newspapers</b>
<dd>Did your local newspaper run a food column that decade? If so? Perfect. Most included
recipes.
<dt><b>Restaurant menus</b>
<dd>
Use the <a href="http://menus.nypl.org/">New York Public Library</a> & 
<a href="http://www.lapl.org/resources/en/menu_collection.html"> Los Angeles Public
Library's</a> digital menu collections to identify what was served in all types of restaurants during
the decade in question. If you need menus
from a specific place and time (1900 Atlantic City? 1945 Nashville?) or menus for specific type of restaurant (Railroad 
dining car? Harvey House? Drive-in movie?) we can help you find dedicated books, museums and
historic societies.

<b>Food in the USA 1900-1910</b><br>
During the early decades of the 20th century, Americans foods reflected the great diversity of 
people living in our country. What people ate depended primarily upon who they were (ethnic
heritage, religious traditions), where they lived (regional food preferences: New Orleans Creole, New England founding father?)
and how much money they had (wealthy railroad tycoon? immigrant street peddler?). Food
manufacturers flooded our markets with new "covenience" foods, such as Jell-O. <br>
<b>Factors affecting Americans cuisine 1900-1910</b><br>
<b>1. Immigration</b><br>
Waves of immigrants introduced new foods and flavors. Most immigrants settled in urban areas,
many opened restaurants and imported foods. The first Italian-style <a href="foodpies.html#pizza">
pizzeria</a> opened in New York City 1905. 
<p>
<b>2. Science & Technology</b><br>
Advances in transportation,  food preservation, and home storage began to equalize local food
availability and lessen dependence upon seasonal variations. Electricity was introduced to homes
beginning with urban areas. Electric appliances (refrigerators, stoves) were introduced but not
generally found in homes until the 1930s. About 
<a href="http://www.sciencetech.technomuses.ca/english/schoolzone/Domestic_Technology2.cfm">Domestic technology</a>
<p>
<b>3. Home Economics & Nutrition Science</b><br>
The Home Economics movement of the late 19th century continued full-force in the 20th.
College women studied the science of cookery and applied their knowledge to improving the
nutrition and health of their families. Some of these women became social workers who
advocated for the poor. They established soup kitchens and classes for new immigrants and low-income homemakers. Many visited tenement homes and worked one-on-one with families. Social
workers/nutrition experts taught their students practical skills regarding cooking safety,
sanitation, nutrition, and marketing. About <a href="http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/homeEc/">Home Economics</a>.
<p>
<b>4. Company</b><br>
New products flooded the American markets. Corporate giants such as the National Biscuit
Company (Nabisco), Campbells, Swift, General Mills, Quaker Oats, Kraft, Jell-O, and Hershey's
provided products, "invented" recipes and created a steady demand for a wider variety of foods. 
<p>

Americans are fascinated with fair food, especially the items attributed to the 1904 St. Louis Exposition. The truth? Most 
of the foods attributed to this fair existed long before 1904. What these foods have in common is that they were mass 
marketed at the St. Louis fair. That is why 1904 holds a special place in the American gastronomic chronology. Foods commonly associated with the
this fair are: ice cream cones, hamburgers, puffed rice, Dr. Pepper, iced tea, Texas-style chili, & peanut butter.

<b>About the 1910s in America:</b><br>
What people eat in all times and places depends upon who they are (ethnic, religious heritage), where they live (urban centers, rural outposts) and how much money 
they have (rich have more choices than poor). 
Which means? In the USA during the 1910s newly immigrated Italian families ate very different food from South Carolina plantation owners, West Virginia coal 
miners, Chicago businessmen and San Francisco Chinese. 
<p>
World War I had an interesting affect on American food. Some major points for consideration. <br><ul>
<li> During the World War I the country was in a severe economic depression which affected food availability. So did the need to feed soldiers. Most folks are familiar with rationing during WWII. It also happened during the first World War. 
<li> While immigrants and returning soldiers introduced new foods to America, they were not celebrated/accepted like they were after WWII. The 1910s was a period of social homogenization (aka melting pot). Social workers and domestic scientists worked hard to Americanize the "foreign-born." 
<li> Commercial food manufacturers flourished. Products were promoted to American housewives as modern, sanitary and economical. Most middle class Americans bought into this idea, and distanced themselves from "grandma's" ways. Self-serve supermarkets were introduced. 
<li> Effect on world cuisine might be the influence of American food companies/products and new technology. Advances in transportation & technology permitted a greater number of foodstuffs (fruits, vegetables, meats &c.) to be shared. 
</ul>
<p>
<a name="10spopular">
<b>Home cooking & family entertaining</b><br>
Typical upwardly-aspiring Anglo-American middle class families in the 1910s took cues from meals suggested by period cook 
books. Technology was moving quickly; foods were readily available, in and out of season. World War I 
imposed unexpected challenges. Here we catch early glimpses of American discomfit reconciling traditional Old World dishes 
(read: heritage) with newly formed alliances (read: opportunity). Most American print sources proclaim culinary nationalism (aka the 'melting pot') was 
summarily celebrated and embraced. For the unity of the country. How else to explain Lasagne with 
American cheese and Chop suey with American hamburger? Despite the fact mainstream print sources opted against reporting what was really being 
stoically served by the matriarchs of our immigrant families, the famliar table remained.

<b>Cocktail parties</b><br>

<b>[1917] </b><br>
"Positively the newest stunt in society is the giving of 'cocktail parties.' The cocktail party is a Sunday matinee affair which originated in St. Louis. Mr. Julius S. 
Walsh, Jr., a leader in social activities there, is responsible for the innovation. Mrs. Walsh introduced it recently, with the first cocktail party in society's history. 
Invitations were issued to fifty. The guests were divided into two classes, those who went to church in the forenoon and those who devoted their time to a motor 
promenade of the boulevards. Then at high noon they gathered at the Walsh home on Lindell boulevard for the hour's 'interregnum preceding 1 o'clock dinner.' 
The party scored an instant hit. Mrs. Walsh's home is equipped with a private bar. Around this the guests gathered and gave their orders to a white-coated 
professional drink mixer who presided behind the polished mahogany. If a woman guest who had been driving all forenoon in her limousine, and was a little chilled in 
consequence, felt the need of a drink with an extra kick in it, she ordered a Sazarac cocktail. Others, of course, preferred a Bronx or Clover Leaf, and a few who 
had been to church where old fashioned enough to order a Martini or a Manhattan. And as long as the professional drink mixer was there to fill all orders other 
beverages than cocktails were in demand. Highballs, some with Scotch and some with rye or Bourbon whisky, gin fizzes--ordered because the spring morning
 hinted of coming summer--and at least one mint julep for a former gentleman of Virginia were handed out over the private bar. That the cocktail party is already a 
St. Louis institution, filling a long-felt Sunday want in society circles there, and that the party at which Mrs Walsh was hostess was so merry and so jolly as to 
approach in hilarity the famous early morning eggnogg parties popular in the same city a decade ago, is vouched for by the St. Louis newspapers. In the meantime 
Mrs. Walsh, because of the innovation, has become more of a social celebrity in St. Louis than ever."<br>

<a name="10sbrands">
<b>Popular American brands</b><br>
Grocery/food ads in city papers sometimes included brands. Many foods were still sold in bulk; company connection was not 
advertised. The concept of "nationally branding" was a rarity in these days. Only the largest companies (willing to spend
big bucks for advertising) went that route. Among the national leaders were the National Biscuit Company (now Nabisco), Campbell's, 
Armour, Coca Cola, Jell-O, Royal, Dole, and Baker's (chocolate, coconut). Most grocery store food ads promoted the product, not the
company or brand. Fresh produce ads in the 1910s 
highlighted point of origin (California figs, Florida oranges, Jersey tomatoes, Baltimore beans, Maine Sugar Corn, Celyon Tea). Same as today!

1920s America was a fascinating time for food. When else would it be possible to juxtapose
Prohibition (popular no alcohol sentiment co-existing with underground speakeasies), exotic culinary experimentation (Chinese food was
popular),
opulent wealth (Delmonicos & 21), extreme poverty (tenement kitchens), social nutrition
movements (home economics & Ladies Aid Organizations) and vegetarian alternatives (Dr.
George
Washington Carver was creating recipes for mock chicken made from peanuts). 
<p>
What effect did Prohibition on American the food and dining habits in the 1920's?<br>
"When Prohibition went into effect in America on January 16, 1920, it did more than stop the
legal sale of alcoholic beverages in our country...[it] increased the production of soft drinks, put
hundreds of restaurants and hotels out of business, spurred the growth of tea rooms and
cafeterias, and destroyed the last vestiges of fine dining in the United States...Hotels tried to
reclaim some of their lost wine and spirit profits by selling candy and soda pop The fruit cocktail
cup, often garnished with marshmallows or sprinkled with powdered sugar, took the place of
oysters on the half shell with champagne and a dinner party opener....The American wine industry,
unable to sell its wines legally, quickly turned its vinyards over to juice grapes. But only a small
portion of the juice from the grapes was marketed as juice. Most of it was sold for home-brewed
wine. Needless to say, this home brew was not usually a sophisticated viniferous product, but
sales of the juice kept many of the vineyards in profits throughout Prohibition.  Prohibition also
brought about cooking wines and artificially flavored brandy, sherry, and rum extracts.
Housewives were advised to omit salt when using cooking wines, as the wines themselves had
been salted to make them undrinkable...Some cooks gave up on alcoholic touches, real or faux,
altogether...The bad alcohol, the closing of fine restaurants, the sweet foods and drinks that took
alcohol's place, the artificial flavors that were used to simulated alcohol, all these things could not
help but have a deletrious effect on the American palate."<br>
---<i>Fashionable Foods: Seven Decades of Food Fads</i>, Sylvia Lovgren [MacMillan:New
York] 1995
(p. 29-30)
<p>
"Prohibition, with its tremendous impact on the eating habits of the country, also had a great deal
to do with the introduction of Italian food to the masses. Mary Grosvenor Ellsworth, in <i>Much
Depends upon Dinner</i>, (1939), said this about Prohibition and pasta: "We cooked them
[pastas] too much, we desecrated them with further additions of flour, we smothered them in
baking dishes and store cheese. Prohibition changed all that. The Italians who opened up
speakeasies
by the thousand were our main recourse in time of trial. Whole hoards of Americans thus got
exposed regularly and often to Italian food and got a taste for it. Now we know from experience
that properly treated, the past is no insipid potato substitute.
     The food served in the speakeasies--with Mama doing the cooking and Papa making the wine
in the basement--was not quite the same as the food the Italians had eaten in the Old Country.
Sicilian cooking was based on austerity...But America was rich, and protein rich country, and the
immigrants were happy to add these symbols of wealth to their cooking--and happy that their new
American customers liked the result. Meatballs, rich meat sauces, veal cutlets cooked with
Parmesean or with lemon, clams stuffed with buttered herbed crumbs, shrimp with wine and
garlic, and mozzarella in huge chunks to be eaten as appetizer were all foods of abundance,
developed by Italian-Americans..."<br>
---<i>Fashionable Foods</i> (p. 37-8)
<p>
<b>What kind of impact did Prohibition have on American cookbooks in the 1920s?</b><br>
 Some continued to list recipes calling for small amounts of beer, wine and liquor as ingredients,
others whistfully noted substitutions, still others omitted the ingredient completely. Grape juice is
sometimes used instead of wine. There also seems to be an increase in the use of extracts (vanilla,
lemon, almond). Extracts are alcohol-based flavorings. We checked several cookbooks for
fruitcake and welsh rarebit recipes (these traditionally include small amounts of alcohol). This is
what we found:
<p>
<i>Every Womans Cook Book</i>, Mrs. Chas. F. Moritz [Cupples & Leon:New York:1926]
devotes several pages of its beverage chapter to making wine at home. Here the 1920s cook
found instructions for blackberry, strawberrry, grape and cherry wine, sherry, sauterne and plum
liquor and home. These wines were generally fermented for 10 days. We have no idea how strong
(% alcohol) they would have been. This book also has a recipe for brandied peaches (without
brandy), claret punch (with 1/2 gallon of claret wine). (p. 616-619), and Welsh rarebit (1/2 cup
cream, ale or beer). (p.631)
<p>
The 1923 edition of Fannie Merritt Farmer's <i>The Boston Cooking School Cook Book</i>,
lists 2 tablespoons brandy in a recipe for rich coffee cake (p. 637).
The President's fruit cake listed in Mrs. Peterson's <i>Simplified Cooking</i>, American School
of Home Economics [Chicago, IL] 1926 (p. 185) lists grape juice as an ingredient, no mention of
alcohol.
<p>
"Brandy used to be a common addition to fruit cakes. The taste cooked out, but it gave richness
to the cake, and probably added to the keeping quality. In the recipes here given, cider, lemon
juice or other fruit juice is substituted for it."<br>
---<i>Everybody's Cook Book</i>, Isabel Ely Lord [Harcourt Brace:New York] 1924 (p. 139)
<p>
<a name="speakeasy">
<b>About speakeasy dining</b> & <a href="fooddecades.html#booze">cocktails</a><br>
"Speakeasy...Also "speak." A term popular during Prohibition to describe an establishment selling
illegal alcoholic beverages. In order to gain entrance, you had to speak in a low voice through a
small opening in the back door and tell the attendant inside who it was who sent you to the place.
The term itself (which dates in print to 1889) may derive from the English "Speak-softly-shop," an
underworld term for a smuggler's house where one might get liquor cheaply, its usage in this
sense having been traced back to 1823. But with the onset of Prohibition in America, speakeasies
sprang up overnight, sometimes in shabby sections of town, but often in the best neighborhoods,
and many of these establishments were actually fine restaurants in their own right. New York's
"21" club was a speakeasy during this period and had two bars, a dance floor, an orchestra, and
diningrooms on two floors...French diplomat Paul Morande, visiting New York for the first time
in 1925, reported his experience at a speakeasy: "...the food is almost always poor, the service
deplorable."<br>
---<i>The Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani
[Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 307)<br>
<p>
"For one speakeasy with pretensions to any sort of elegance, there were dozens of drab cellar or
tenement bars where no money or thought was wasted on decor. When a speakeasy of some
standing as a restaurant as well as a bar emerged, such as that well known New York repair, still
legitimately flourishing, Jas and Charlie's 21 (sometimes referred to as "The Twenty-One Club,"
although it never had official club status), it was because discreet official protection had been
guaranteed to it which made the investment gilt-edged."<br>

York] 1976 (p. 398)

[NOTE: What was <a href="foodpioneer.html#freelunch">Free lunch</a>?]
<p>
<a name="booze">
<b>What kinds of drinks were served?</b><br>
That, of course depended upon the "quality" of the establishment. Speakeasys catering to wealthy
clientele likely offered the same fine wines and mixed drinks that were available prior to
Prohibition. Other establishments sold "bathtub" gin. Recommended reading: <i>Drinking in America: A
History</i>, Mark Edward Lender and James Kirby Martin [Free Press:New York] 1982.
Prohibition-era newspapers offered daily reports of illegal cocktail parties, mostly focused on social impropriety, military/government
double standards, and high profile divorce. Of course, there were some well known people who 
believed: "If you can't beat 'em, join 'em." Compare with <a href="1927cocktails.html">fancy cocktails 1927</a>.
How much did these drinks <a href="http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodfaa5.html#prohibition">cost</a>?

<b>[1925] </b><br>
"Mrs. [Esther Ford] Wait is a prohibitionist--that is, she believes in prohibition if it can be enforced. 'But as it can't,' she said, 'I have nothing against a drink or two
 at bridge parties or serving cocktails to my friends when they come to dine. Justice Ford...cited his daughter as an example of a nice, young modern girl who goes
 to cocktail parties...'Cocktail drinking an cigarette smoking by women are questions of manners, not morality.'"<br>

<b>Great Gatsby Dining</b><br>
Gatsby and his friends were adventurous diners. They dined in the finest New
York clubs (Twenty One, Stork, Embassy, Simplon, Surf, Yale, and 51 1/2 East Fifty First), trendy ethnic restaurants (Chinatown)
and catered elegantly at home.

<b>The Waldorf-Astoria</b>, New York City<p>
"With the passing of the war, America settled down to begin an era of onrushing prosperity. But it
was also
the era of Prohibition. I glance into menus, from 1921 on: Menus for dinners to honor such
figures as
Charles M. Schwab...Another significant change was evident in this era, as my menus show. The
banquets
became less sumptuous--more, shall I say, utilitarian? Certainly, the courses had been pared down.
For
instance, a dinner in February, 1924, for President Coolidge. (Note the "Appolinaris" and "White
Rock" but
no mention whatever of any wines or liquors.) Here is the menu:

What did average Americans eat in the 1920s? Food historians tell us we had a sweet tooth, a
taste for the exotic, and a well-developed sense of ordered creativity. Translation? Fruit cocktails,
<a href="foodcakes.html#pineapple">Pineapple upside-down
cake</a> and Jell-O molds. Tea sandwiches, fancy salads, and chafing-dish recipes were also "in."
City kitchens were wired with electricity meaning foods could be safely refrigerated at home.
General Electric (and other companies) published cooking brochures touting frozen foods and
safe meat storage. 
<p>
Conversely? Modern vegetarianism also began the 1920s. Peanuts were promoted as healthy
protein alternatives to animal meat. Raw foods were likewise promoted. Ladies Aid Societies and
Domestic Scientists worked hard to introduce balanced, nutritional meals to poor, laboring people
and help newly arrived immigrants adjust to American markets.

<p>
In times of famine, war, and extreme hardship people have been known to eat things they might
not consider during "normal" times. According to the food historians, the Great Depression was
not such a period. Why? There was an ample, inexpensive food supply. People struggling to make
put food on the table had the option of purchasing  lesser grades of meat (chuck instead of sirlion
beef), cheaper cuts of animal (heart, brains, feet), and manufactured substitutes (Crisco instead of
butter).  Folks who needed help were served by private soup kitchens and government programs.
These services were in place throughout the country. This was a decade of cutting back; not
starvation.
<p>
"Though the depression did not have any immediate impact or obvious effects on American
cookery--the food sections of popular magazines never mentioned the terrible plight of many of
their readers and only occasionally ran a feature on economical meals--still the effects were there,
subtle but pervasive...when, and if, Americans did eat out in the 1930s, it was much more likely to
be at an inexpensive place, serving familiar, American food, than at a fancy restaurant. And those
Americans were much more likely to order coffee or a sweet, inexpensive soft drink rather than
unfamiliar and expensive wine to wash down their food. The Depression also changed the way
many Americans entertained at home. Except for the upper echelons of society, most families
were now maidless, which made grand, formal dinner parties impossible. Instead, hostesses gave
luncheons, teas, and cozy Sunday Night Suppers around the chafing dish...The Thirties aslo ushed
in an era of women's clubs--whether dedicated to charitable activities, gardening, or the fine art of
bridge--perhaps as a reaction to the individualistic Twenties, perhaps as a kind of atavistic
huddling together against the harsh realities of the new age. And what was eaten when the clubs
got together...was women's food: dainty, light, frothy, sweet, creamy, and decorated...But
weren't many Americans starving in the Thirties? Not really. There was hunger, of course, but it
was primarily concentrated in the poorest rural areas...And while Dust Bowl housewives might
have had to make their bread inside a drawer to keep the drifting dust out, at least there was
bread. Relief agencies and make-work jobs helped some of the worst off, and low food prices
made everyone except the food companies happier. Sugar prices, too, were low, and in the
Thirties Americans consumed more sugar per capita then they have done before or since..."<br>
---<i>Fashionable Food: Seven Decades of Food Fads</i>, Sylvia Lovegren [Macmillan:New
York] 1995 (p. 41-44)
<p>

"...while the Depression brought bread lines, soup kitchens, hoboes begging for food at
middle-class doors, and thousands of hungry families in devastated parts of rural America,
starvation was
unheard-of. Persistent hunger was more common, but it was localized, affecting mainly
marginalized populations who played a small role in politics or the marketplace. After the initial
disocation, when local and private relief agencies were bankrupted, enough federal and state
resources seem to have been mobilized to provide enough relief and/or jobs to head off serious
threats to the nutrition of most of the poor and unemployed, particularly in the cities. In any
event, there is no indication, in mortality and other statistics, of an overall deterioration in the
health of the nation. Falling food prices seem to have helped. Studies of low-income families in
five northern industrial cities during the tough spring of 1933, when the nation's economy was in
ruins, presented a bleak but by no means horrendous picture. Those whose  incomes were over
three dollars per person per week (not a handsome amount) consumed an average of over 3,000
calories per adult male per day. Those with incomes of two to three dollars per person per week
still averaged 2,800 calories per adult male per day while only those on the very bottom, the
relatively small proportion living on less than two dollars per person, lived near the margin of
hunger, averaging 2,470 calories per day. Even in southern mill-towns...the poorer workers still
ate better than their counterparts of twenty years earlier. While they did cut back on meat, fowl,
fish, and fresh fruit, they still ate adequate amounts of vegetables, fresh and canned...This does
not mean that the Depression did not scare Americans. Whether hungry or not, economic hardship
was ever-present in most Americans' minds: they either experienced it, feared it, or were
concerned about others living through it. But unlike the food crises which used to rack the
pre-industrial world, this one took place among food surpluses, not shortages."<br>

[Oxford University Press:New York] 1988 (p. 196-7)

A survey of 1930s American cookbooks is full recipes that may appear strange/interesting to us
today. These were completely "normal" back in those days. We know they were "normal"
because the same recipes appear in books published in previous decades. The following recipes
were included in <i>Aunt Sammy's Radio Recipes Revised</i>, Bureau of Home Economics,
U.S. Department of Agriculture [1931]: baked bean sandwiches (mashed to a paste and served on
brown bread), beef loaf (aka meatloaf), fresh beef tongue (considered a delicacy!), liver and bacon
(favorite from the "Old World"), ox tail stew (a French treat), scalloped cabbage and apples (a
German recipe).

<b>Modern American kitchens, 1932</b><br>
According to <a href="fooddecades.html#mabelclaire">Mabel Claire</a>, "Today's" kitchens should be colorful workshops arranged for
cooking convenience. 
<p>
<b>"The Kitchen, A Workshop of Color and Charm.</b>The kitchen should be the pleasant room in the house. There is not good reason for the millions of ugly kitchens in the world.
Nor is there any good reason for kitchens that look like white tile lunchrooms. In a kitchen that is gay, cozy, and pleasant,
half the labor of cooking seems to be eliminated. In many houses that have been restored and kept in memory of another day,
the kitchen is a most interesting and delightful room. When a tour of the house has been made and the kitchen is reached, there
is always a sigh of pleasure. A sense of comfort and jollity pervades the place. The mellow walls, the lovely old containers for
flours and spices, the gay platters, bowls and cups, the gleaming copper, the rocking chairs!...The modern housewife should try to
bet her kitchen the same jolly atmosphere, while preserving a convenient arrangement of furnishings and utensils. The best arrangement
for labor savings is one where all operations move from left to right: Refrigerator to work table, table to stove, stove to
serving table, and to sink...A visit to the kitchen furnishing department of a modern store sets the mind teeming with ideas that will
add charm and confidence to your kitchen. Most kitchens can be improved and whether you wish to add the largest or smallest item, ti
will be an inspiration to wander through these departments and get new ideas for the present or future shopping. The new iceless
refrigerators and new designs in gas and electric ranges are finished now in lovely plain or tiled effects and a variety of
colors. Since they are the most important and largest of single items their color will determine your kitchen color scheme to
a considerable extent. Kitchen cabinets have so many built-in conveniences they are well worth owning. Both the kitchen and 
utility type cabinets give space with doors to hide whatever seems unsightly or is 'out of the picture.'...Keep the kitchen workshop
free from the confusion of too many things. Both types of such cabinets come in a variety of colors to match your kitchen plan. 
Utility cabinets may be purchased in separate units and enlarged by adding units as they are needed. The there are the hanging
shelves that fit into odd space and make such a difference in the convenient arrangement of your supplies and equipment. They
might hold your cook books, for your should collect cook books if you wish to improve your cooking technique--and who
doesn't? Cook book collecting is one of the most fascinating hobbies in which a woman can indulge. The floor linoleum should be 
considered as an essential part of your kitchen color scheme. There is a wide variety in this field and the modern oil cloth that
is useful to cover some shabby shelf or table also comes in patterns that are charming and beautiful. Shelving in string or delicate 
colors and edging is another intriguing item of kitchen furnishing. The shelf edgings are made also in attractive paper
designs. The modern gleaming metal ware kitchen utensils are works of art in design and finish. Enamel ware comes in a variety
of colors. The color and shapes of waffle pitchers, sets of mixing bowls, containers for dry groceries and spices in metal and glazes
are painted tin are varied enough to suit every person's artistic instinct. Remember that the several metals and enamel finishes
as well as glass and china are each suited best to certain uses. One must not lose sight of utility while satisfying the desire
for color and charm...The size of the kitchen has nothing to do with its charm. My own kitchen is a small one, but it is so 
pleasing to me that I never enter it without a glow of satisfaction. At the window hangs a gay India print in which blue
predominates. Shelves of assorted sizes are everywhere. Their edges are painted lacquer red. On the broad shelves are gayly
patterned serving platters, tureens, colored glass dishes, fat casseroles, blue and amber drinking glasses and pitchers. Jolly
flasks of Venetian glass contain vinegar and oil. Keeping these in the kitchen saves many steps...The tiniest set of 
shelves holds the spices and colors for decorating and garnishing. Blooming plants line the window sill. Several decorative 
trays hang on the walls...Above my stove I have hung a mirror in a green and gold frame. It reflects the jolly kitchen as well as the cook. A cook
should consult a mirror often. For what use is a decorative kitchen without a decorative woman in it!"<br>

<b>Who was Mabel Claire?</b><br>
Artist, author, wife, and entrepreneur. She was promoted as the 1930s ideal modern housewife for her time-saving ideas and
successful lady-like career. Because she advocated new appliances and novel kitchen gadgets, Ms. Claire's cook books were featured
in department stores. Macy's and Bamberger's (New York based) commissioned thousands of books with their store names on the
cover. While not representative of American homes struggling through hard times, Ms. Claire's ideal kitchen 
gave housewives hope.
<p>
"'Shortcut Cookery,' by Mabel Claire (Greenberg). This is not only a list of recipes, but the reflection of a state of mind. 'Powder your nose' is the author's last word in the 
instructions for preparing an appetizing dinner. 'The woman who serves roast bride with the roast lamb is not a thoroughly successful wife.' Flippant? Not at all. Efficient? 
Efficient and decorative. The parboiled housewife, martyred , breathless, exasperated, has gone out. If not, this book will help to hurry her out. It contains exceedingly 
useful pages of half-time methods for getting full-time results. Economical, too: long hours of cooking destroy food values, use too much gas. There is something 
essentially modern in the point of view, especially in the chapter on kitchen aesthetics. The description of the brave and gallant kitchen with its gaily patterned honey
 jars, and shelves with edges painted lacquer red--the kitchen of a woman with wit enough to enjoy cooking as well as wit enough to understand it. One finds oneself
 mentally tagging at her heels, fascinated, enthralled, as she darts about, putting dabs of green angelica on lemon foam puddings, red cinnamon candies on cooked 
apples. Oh yes, it is distinctly decorative cooking. 'All of these are the things that make a cook into an artist.'..."<br>
---"Aesthetic Cookery: A Book That Is Not Only a Cook Book, But a Creed Too," <i>Manitoba Free Press</i> [Winnipeg CA], November 7, 1927, Literary and Book Review Section (p.1) 

<p>
"When artist writes a book of recipes it indicates two things. The first is that the meals will be colorful and interesting, and the second, that being a sculptor and still
 finding time to write such a volume, the author's cooking as been very carefully organized to achieve the maximum results in a minimum of time. Therefore, we are not 
surprised to read the title of the book by Mabel Claire, 'The Busy Woman's Cook Book, or Cooking by the Clock.' (New York:Greenberg, Inc. $1.50). The chapter titles give
 an idea of the manner in which the author has systematized the business of meals...With each menu is given a shopping list containing everything needed for the meal...
Below these lists the author gives directions for each according to its place in the schedule of 15, 20 or 30 minutes, and it is this scheduling that makes the book a 
particular value to the inexperienced cook...Mabel Claire is one of those whom the world delights to dub 'modern women' although she says was born just long enough ago 
to be an old-fashioned girl, which is to say that she learned to cook and bake as well as to model clay and hammer brass. She always wanted to be a sculptor but she put
 it off until after she was married. She came to New York seven years ago and studied sculpture at the Art Students' League under Caldwell and Leo Lentelli. Miss Claire 
found that it costs money to study art, and to solve the money problem, she began modeling add little ink wells and utility jars and boxes which she sold in the small gift 
shops of Greenwich Village. As she progressed in her work, she evolved a family of wax candles in the form of Mother Goose characters. She christened her work the 
Candlestick Family, protected by copyright, put it in the hands of a national sales organization and then found she had to organize herself into a factory that could turn out
 in bulk the amusing little handmade people. When her business interfered with her being a housewife, her friends began to tell her that the easiest thing was to give up
 housekeeping, but Miss Claire believed that two people can remain much happier if the dine pleasantly at home...So she searched out the ways in which her household 
duties could be shortened. Her friends copied her methods and borrowed her menus, until Miss Claire decided to add to her duties as housewife, manufacturer and artist
 those of an author."<br>---"Woman Sculptor Writes Book of Unusual Recipes," <i>Freeport Journal-Press</i> [IL], September 12, 1925 (p. 8)

"Mrs. Jack Bechdolt of the Hotel Margaret, Brooklyn, known as a writer under the pen name Mabel Claire, died in a Manhattan hospital on Thursday at the age of 43. 
Mrs. Bechdolt recently returned home from the hospital where she had long been a patient. Her condition grew worse on Thursday and she was returned to the institution 
shortly before her death. Mrs. Bechdolt was born in Aberdeen, Wash., a daughter C.J. Glasier, Superintendent of Schools there. She was the author of a book on
 domestic science, a contributor to women's magazines, and also was known as a sculptor and water-color artist. She is survived by her husband, also a writer."<br>

<b>SOUP KITCHENS & <a href="fooddecades.html#penny">PENNY RESTAURANTS</a></b><br>
1930s soup kitchens were run/funded by charitable organizations: religious groups, Ladies Aid
Societies, Salvation Army etc. community service groups, government agencies, companies, organized crime and
private individuals. They relied on volunteers and donations. Depression-era Brooklyn soup
kitchens most likely served different food from those in Cleveland, Houston and Bakersfield. This
would have reflected the local tastes and available produce. Many other countries experienced
Depression circumstances during the 1930s...their soup kitchen menus could have been altogether
different.
<p>
During the Depression (same as today) food/soup kitchen cooks were experts at maximizing whatever
they had on hand to serve that night. What they served, and how they served it, depended upon
the facility (how big was the kitchen?), local support (food donations?), and the number of people
who needed help (how far to stretch?).  Sometimes the best soup kitchens could do was dole out
bread and and coffee. Sometimes they could offer other foods (cakes, cookies, casseroles)
donated by local charitable organizations, grocery stores or restaurants. More fortunate people
where encouraged to grow "charity gardens" so that the soup kitchens could offer fresh fruits and
vegetables. The most notorious of American soup kitchens was funded by Al Capone, in Chicago.
According to the papers, his consitutents ate better than most.
<p>
<b>Food notes from the New York Times:</b><br>
"Soup kitchens and the missions state that they can always get meat scaps and day-old bread,
frequently for nothing and always for very little, but the vegetables that make up the bulk of the
soups and stews which they serve are few and far between, and those they can afford are poor and
stale. Arrangements are being made to have baskets at the Grand Central and Pennsylvania
Station to recieve contributions of fruit and vegetables brough in on trains."<br>
---"Urges  Charity Gardens'," <i>New York Times</i>, April 14, 1932 (p. 18)
<p>
 "Three meals are served each day, including Sundays. Breakfast consists of coffee and a sweet
roll, and dinner and supper of soup, bread and coffee, with a second or third helping
permitted."<br>
---"Capone Feeds 3,000 a Day in Soup Kitchen," <i>New York Times</i>, November 15, 1930
(p. 4)
<p>
"Dozens of jobless men today received food from "soup kitchens" as the city opened temporary
commisaries to care for hungry families. Mayor Hoan, a Socialist, ordered the old policy armory
kitchen thrown open tomorrow as a municipal kitchen. Temporary headquarters gave bread, milk,
cheese and coffee to the hungry today."<br>

"...families will be supplied with tickets entitling them to soup, and probably bread, every day. The
meat and vegetables will be donated by other members of the district, and the funds to operate the
kitchen have already been provided."<br>

21)<br>
[NOTE: the 15th district was considered a wealthy neighborhood. That it was installing a soup
kitchen for its residents was a sad sign of the times.]

<b>Why soup? </b><br>
Throughout time, in almost every culture and cuisine, soups and have been the primary foods
consumed by people with not much money. It is economical (can be composed of whatever the
cook has on hand that day...can be stretched to feed more by adding liquid), simple to cook (one
large pot, does not require much in the way of fuel/cooking appliances/utensils), easy to serve
(requires only a bowl/cup and a spoon, in a pinch it can be sipped without a spoon) and requires
minimal clean-up. Bread also has a long history of filling empty bellies during the worst of times.
<p>
<a name="penny">
<b>Penny restaurants</b><br>
"Penny Restaurants" were subsidized by social service organizations. The point was to provide good, hot meals to unemployed folks
too proud to accept charity.
<p>
"Manhattan's newest mid-town penny restaurant is doing a rushing business...Ont he two upper floors there is a sevice change of three cents a meal, and a chance to sit down at the 
gleaming white tables after the diners have collected the items of thier meal cafeteria fashion...But it is on the ground floor that
the penny meal plan devised by the Bernarr Macfadden Foundation is seen in its full benefits for the white-collar worker whose self-respect
will not permit him to beg so long as he can find occasional work. Of such men and women there are many thousands in New York City
today who obtain an occasional day's work that enables them to keep going...the Free Food Ticket Fund Committee...works in conjuction with
with the penny restaurants. Mrs. Sprague said that in the las few weeks donations enough to provide 75,000 five-cent meals had been
received. The organization hopes to provide 2000 meals a day for 250 days, which will require a fund of $25,000. Seventy-five per cent
of the patrons of the penny restaurants are unemployed, it is estimated. At one cent an order the diners may obtain soup, cracked 
wheat, steamed cornmeal, steamed oatmeal, steamed hominy grits, bread pudding, stewed prunes, stewed raisins, honey, milk, tea,
raisin coffee, black coffee, whole wheat doughnut, two slices of whole wheat bread or whole wheat raisin bread. For five cents...it is possible
to obtain a filling lunch, for with soup, pudding and a beverage, accounted for at three cents, and order of creamed codfish on toast
may be had for two cents more. Omit the pudding or the beverage, and your nickel will buy one of the three cent orders; a meat cake,
fruit salad, half a grapefruit, sliced peaches, a whole wheat crumb cake, lettuce and tomates, tuna fish salad. To those who 
hadn't a nickel, a total average for 1200 five-cent meals have been served without charge daily at the five penny restaurants now
operating in New York City. The total number of meals now being served in these restaurants averages more thean 10,000 a day. 
Today persons in need of one of these nickel meals must go to one of the 90 welfare organizations scattered about the city for a
ticket. As some of these needy ones still have sufficient pride to dislike applying for charity in any guise, it is hoped by
the penny restaurant managers that the city welfare department will soon see fit to relsease a license to permit applicants
for tickets to sand in line near the mid-town restaurant, waiting their turn when a generous passer-by makes possible, by a donation of 
$1, for 20 of these men to eat. From 500 to 800 men have been in the Forty-third Street twice daily, satisfied to wait an hour or 
more on the street for the pot-luck that will come to them in the crowd, a way of getting a meal ticket without asking sometone for it...
Why is the City Welfare Department holding up the license forr this line? According to the best explanation obtainable, it is thought
at City Hall that it "does not look well" at this time for such a line to be seen in a mid-town street." "At this time" may be
interpreted as covering vaguely a preelection period, during which Tammany would have the city wear as fair a face as possible. Thrusting a 
congregation of hungry men into the public eye twice daily, even on such an unfashionable thoroughfare as Sixth Avenue, is 
not precisely the best possible advertisment for the merits of the incumbent administration."<br>

<b>Family meals, general observations:</b><p>
"For family consumption there is just at present, a vogue for the combination dinner, the main dish of which may be anything
from a one-pot recipe to an oven or grill colleciton including meat, green and starch vegetables and dessert all cooked at
the same time, over the one heat unit, and served as a unit, too. Whether the tendency is due to a cultivated taste for blended flavors
than to the modern cry for speed and 'efficiency' is hard to determine. But every thougthful home-maker is able to set several
reasons for this intimate service which not only brings variation to home tables, but more than cuts in half the serving and
washing dishes. Among the meals are such selections as noodles, cooked first, drained an baked with tomato sauce, mushrooms and 
strips of bacon. This combination goes to the table in its pretty glass or porcelain baking dish garnished with parsley.
With it is served a simple salad, and for dessert a hot and sugary baked pear or apple with cream. A second one-pot dinner is the 
veal or lamb pie, cooked with all sorts of vegetables and a top crust of biscuit dough, lightly browned. These pies can be made very
dainty served in individual ramekins or small deep-dish pie plates. So far as nicety goes, we are not as they say, getting
back to first principles of the caveman. For today's one-dish dinners are managed with much neatness and an appetizing flair.
But in simplicity and the wholesome ingredients coook in their blended habit of letting various juices the modern adapatation
has all the good points of its early ancestors."<br>

<b>Snacking in the 1930s</b><br>

"Where are the snacks of yesterday? A spirited discussion over popcorn in the correspondence columns of The New York Times raises the
question: and--though there seems to be a popcorn revival in New York--it must be conceded that many of the between-meals
foods and drinks of a generation, or even a decade, ago have vanished almost as completely as the snows. A retrospective glance over
the present century reveals a surprising series of changes, behind which the discerning might find almost a complete social history of
the epoch...Many of the changes are results of our progressive organization and of the much-discussed standardization of life. Formerly
local products were the chief source of our snacks, as was much of our regular food. In New Hampshire the young folks got out a flatiron
and a hammer in Winter evenings and cracked butternuts which they had gathered and dried in the Autumn before. In Iowa they regaled
themselves on hazel or hickory nuts; in Virginia they lugged out a sack of chiquapins or chestnuts. Nowadays all three States unite in 
eating pecans from Florida and almonds from California.
<p>
"In these urban days it has become easier to buy than to make one's tidbits. Molasses taffy used to be made at every
god-fearing American home. A 'taffy pull' was a jolly form of entertainment, even if the candy did sometimes turn out to be rather
tough. After the 'taffy pull' had lost a little of its pulling power came the era of home-made fudge; in the earlier years of the 
century every girl had--or is supposed to have had--a plate of this confection of her own making to offer the 'boy friend...
<p>
"Incidentally, changing domestic conditions have had much to do with shifting fashions in snack. The evolution of the kitchen of yesterday
to the 'serving pantry' of today has worked havoc with between-meals tidbits at home. A roomy cupboard or capacious pantry went with
every old-fashioned kitchen...The delightful part was that one rarely know just what one would turn up as the reward of 
prowling...there was usually a jar of jam, already opened, or a crock of apple butter. A thick slice of home-made bread with a deep
spread of apple butter made a wonderful filling for the chinks in a hungry boy's stomach after school...
<p>
"...among the causes that have brought changes in our between-meal eating and drinking habits much importance must be conceded to the
astounding developments in preserving and packaging goods which have occurred in this century and especially since the
World War. The new technique of wrapping and packaging has brought about the spectacular development--largely within a decade--of the 
5-cent candy packages now ubiquitous at news stands, drug stores, tobacco shops and the cashier's counters of restaurants. Undoubtedly
the constant proximity of such mouthfuls has increased the amount of between-meals munching, at least among city people. What more
natural, when waiting for a subway train, than to leave a nickel and pick up a package of Aurora Borealis gum drops? What woman,
even when trying to take off a pound a week, can resist the appeal on every hand to buy a 5-cent bar of Angels' Delight milk
chocolate? The increased offering of snacks of carious sorts in public places has, in the space of a generation, revolutionized
the American attitude toward eating in public places. Formerly, a grown man or woman considers it undignified to munch while walking
along the street, but today almost anybody from college professor to errand boy will make away with a bit of candy as he strolls
Broadway; and some people think nothing of whole-heartedly cramming down a large-sized banana.
<p>
"Packaging has been extended to nuts as well as sweets...Peanuts, like candies, are mostly offered these days in 5-cent packages, shelled,
hulled and salted--salted far too much for the taste of the true peanut gourmet, but necessarily so, dealers say, to repel
insects. One of the latest comers among packaged nuts is the cashew...Symptomatic of, change in our between-meal eating habits is the
metamorphosis of the soda fountain. A generation ago a soda fountain was an inconspicuous affair where there was carbonated
water, half a dozen syrups and practically nothing else...Today, when one calls for a 'soda,' ice cream is put in as a matter of course,
and in order to get a plain drink one would have to tell the attendant how to make it...A rival to the soda-water fountains in 
serving between-meals foods and drinks has appeared in the past decade in the spectacular prolifertion of cubby-hole counters for
the sale of orange drink and more recently of pineapple beverages; and the 'hot-dog' grill, once limited to Coney Island and other
excursion resorts, has within the same period spread like measles all over the country...
<p>
"The school boy or girl coming down the street with a once-cent piece...receives most respectful attention from candy factories 
which spread over blocks as well as from retailers...The hand that holds the penny still rules a considerable part
of the candy world...The tastes of childhood seem to have remained more conservative and constant in this century of upheaval than
those of their elders. The old-time rock candy has gone...and probably one would have to go far today to discover those delightful
motto candies that we knew when we were very young--the heart-shaped disks with such frank avowals as 'I love you'...
But the licorice drops and 'shoe strings' of the Age of Innocence still abide. Lollypops...as also the traditional red-and-white
peppermint candies, are other childhood favorites which have survived...After-dinner mints...are for grown-ups who do not 
understand the subleties of candy or much of anything else. Even though made anemic white, they have become enormously popular of late 
years. One factory recently turned out seventy tons in twenty-four hours.
<p>
"Traveling carts still bake and sell sweet potatoes on the east side in Winter; and other carts in season dispense corn boiled
on the cob. Best of all, the perambulating vendor with his charcoal fire and sweet-smelling pan of roasting chestnuts still
pervades even the busiest streets of New York. For him the century has brought only one change. The disappearance of American
chestnut trees has made it necessary to substitute Italian nuts for the smaller and...sweeter native variation...
"A generation jaded with 'cocktail teas' may return with zest to the kaffeeklatsch,' or late-afternoon repast of coffee
and cakes, once traditional among New York's German families. And who knows but that the perverse younger generation, blase
with hip-flask parties, would welcome as a hilarious novelty an old-fashioned 'taffy pull.'"<br>

<b>Dietary concerns</b><br>
<a name="eatingfads">
"Americans have become so food conscious that they must beware of food fads. That is the opinion of Mrs. Quindara Oliver Dodge, of Boston, National president of the American 
Dietetic Association...'Our association frowns on all reducing diets...We feel that American women have done positive harm to their constitutions by adopting such radical food 
measures. Only for physical welfare and not for beauty of figure should any woman consider adopting any special diet.' The spinach-haters of every family should give Mrs. Dodge 
three cheers, for she actually doesn't insist on spinach having its very own regular place in the family menus. But there is a catch in this freedom-from-spinach allowed by this 
Nationally known food expert. 'If...you dont have spinach on the family menu then be sure to include a proper amount of cellulose from other foods.' The celluose...may be had in proper
 quantities from the none too popular turnip greens so plentiful through the South. So plentiful their feeling toward turnip greens will determine the extent of relief for spinach-haters.
 Liberal views toward self-selection of foods by children are held by the organization of dieticians. 'Let the children select their foods and in most cases they will choose the right 
nourishment for their bodies...It may be said that too much adult control has been exercised in feeding children.' This principle of letting children choose what htey would eat is so new
 and radical that it needs proper research, so a definate project of this kind on which findings will soon be announced is under way in Indiana. Sixty children between the ages of three 
and 16 are choosing their own menus for a period of three months, while a similar group is fed by the usual method of adults' planning of menus. Accurate sialy chickeng is being made 
of weight so fthe children through the three-months trial of the experiment."<br>

[NOTE: We do not find any reports regarding the findings of the study. We do find several articles advocating adult supervision of children's diet.]

<b>Cocktails & hors d'oeuvres</b><br>
When the end of Prohibition was in sight, furturists pondered what "new" drinking establishments would be like.
Men-only saloons went the way of the horse and buggy. Hush-hush speakeasies were no longer needed. What would the future 
bring? Plenty of change. Most notably: respectable men and women drinking together in public. Good bye 
<a href="foodpioneer.html#freelunch">free lunch</a>. Hello bar menus. How much did drinks <a href="foodfaq5.html#prohibition30s">cost</a>?
<p>
<b>[1933]</b><br>
"First the old-fashioned saloon, then the newfangled speakeasy, then what? This is the question which bobs up these days like the ghost of
 Banquo at Macbeth's feast to trouble both the moderates and the wringing wets. If it is beer alone which is being discussed, the discussion as to 
whether to sell it in barrels or battles in hotels and restaurant or over the counter like ice cream soda is as important as its alcoholic content. 
When the total repeal of prohibition comes up the question becomes even more complicated. The only point on which almost all the advocates of 
beer and light wines and some of the advocates of cups which inebriate as well as cheer seem agreed is that the saloons shall not return. To make
 this statement is a little like saying that the Victorian red plush sofa or the horse and buggy shall not return, for, whatever the laws of the land 
may be, the saloon, as America once knew it, is an out of date as those two ounce cherished institutions. two-thirds of Congress and 
three-fourths of the States may conceivably join to legalize hard drinking. ..The saloon brought about prohibition, but the process cannot be 
worked backward--the repeal of prohibition cannot bring back the saloon...The things that killed the saloon were those that made it picturesque. 
Its allurement and its wickedness were those of a vanished day when, for hundreds of thousands of men, drinking was almost the only cheap and 
regular entertainment available during the hours of more or less elegant leisure. This being true, it is now possible to regard the saloon as a 
historical episode and not as a live issue and to approach it--figuratively speaking--with the philosophical detachment of one contemplating a 
social trend which has curled up and died. There are...many misconceptions about it. it has had its better enemies and some who have seen it 
both good and evil. It was infinitely better than the vile speakeasies which sell 'smoke' in the poorest sections of New York; it was no worse than
 the beer houses which now clutter floors in mid-manhattan; and it was worse in some ways than the quieter speakeasies so largely patronized by 
men and women who want good food with cocktails or wine...Whether for better or worse, it was unique in its masculinity...'The best patron of a 
saloon is the man with the biggest thirst'...Patrons of the saloons did get drunk. The worse the saloon, the more drunks. But, as social workers and
 clergymen have admitted, inebriation was not the saloon's only product. Frequently the saloon served the best food in the neighborhood, including
 food for the mind as well as the body. It was of the home of a local debating society...Through saloons men kept track of one another,
 particularly in factory or mill districts; the bartender was a purveyor of news as well as of refreshment..Very different are the speakeasies which 
have taken the place of the workingman's saloon--dispensaries in the rear of buildings where dinks may be had for 10 cents and up. There was a 
time when 15 cents would buy a drink of good whisky; the same amount now buys only 'smoke,' a concoction able to produce an intoxication that
 is a complete physical and nervous collapse...'Smoke' places cater to the down-and-out; they are seldom frequented by men who work. 
Workingmen with jobs and able to afford anything alcoholic usually make it a home. The cheap speakeasy as a Hogarthian degradation. The old
 Bowery knew something just as low, but there such saloons were segregated by custom and the gregariousness of the 'bum.' Now the vicious, 
illegal drinking place has spread over the poorer sections of the city. The war and prohibition brought about radical changes in the drinking habits 
of Americans, principally because of the participation of women. The cocktail hour was more or less recognized during the war was no longer an 
exclusively masculine privilege..the speakeasy was at first largely a place for men, with indifferent attention to food and no attempt to cultivate 
an 'atmosphere.' It was some time before the speakeasy lost the air of surreptitious wickedness and became a normal part of the life in Eastern 
cities. And in its evolution it was affected tremendously by the insistence of men on sharing it with women--or perhaps it was the other way 
around. The old custom of standing at the bar and downing glasses of beer or highballs gave way to sitting in a quiet and curtained dining room 
and consuming hard liquor at leisure. Speakeasies to a large extent have followed a natural development determined by feminine emancipation. If 
prohibition had not arrived it is certain nevertheless that there would have been much more public drinking by women than there was in the '90s; 
prohibition added the zest of the forbidden and so hastened the sharing by women of what had been man's exclusive privilege in this country. 
There are many restaurants what come under the designation of speakeasies because the serve liquor, which are as quite and dignified as any 
old-time chop house. As a matter of fact, speakeasies are seldom riotous places--the feminine influence is too strong. Their proprietor have 
learned that by serving good food as well as liquor they can keep a clientele indefinitely...They have their greatest patronage in the evening, 
drawing from the middle class, whose men would seldom have frequented the saloon at night. The speakeasy's place has become so firmly fixed, at 
least in New York life, that probably beer alone could not dislodge it. There are as many kinds of speakeasies as there were saloons, but they 
types of men who frequent them are more restricted. At the bar of the average saloon men of every class rubbed shoulders, but such bars were 
no more like those of the average modern speakeasy than they were like the bar of Sherry's, quite to the point of exclusiveness. The present
 home of liquid refreshment may be a baronial-appearing house off Fifth Avenue or a dive near the waterfront--both are speakeasies. One is more
 expensive than the other and does not poison its patrons; both are equally illegal, and the difference between the people who go to them is the 
difference between the extremes of society...At noon and from the hour before dinner until late at night these places are often filled with men and 
women, and the number of women who go together without feeling the need for masculine escort is astonishingly large. Such places have become 
the playgrounds of a certain type of New Yorker; they are frequently garish in decoration, completely dominated by woman's influence...For a large
 group of moderate drinkers who used to drop into saloons occasionally, but who now cannot afford to patronize speakeasies and do not care to 
corrode their interiors with 'smoke,' there is a fascinating occupation of making beer, wine or other liquor at home. At the worst, unless something 
blows up, this helps to keep the family together. But both the speakeasy and home brewing are doomed if repeal brings with it the sale of alcoholic 
drinks at a price the average man can afford. So we come to the 'then what?' phrase of our discussion. Whatever it is that takes the place of the 
legalized drinking places of old, it is certain that it will have competition that the saloon did not have. Life is not so monotonous as it was--at least
 there are more kinds of monotony. Since prohibition began, in 1919, attendance at motion picture theatres has about tripled--the motion picture
 now occupies two hours or more of the average person's time each week. In 1919 radio broadcasts did not exist--now there are perhaps 
16,000,000 sets, brining into what Victorians would have called the parlor practically everything in the civilized world, from Kings and Presidents to 
symphony orchestras, jazz bands and 'crooners' that can make an interesting noise...On summer Sundays all who can afford the cheapest 
second-hand car take to the road...These changes make it certain that no drinking place can ever occupy the place that the old-fashioned saloon 
did. There is too much competition. But that there is a demand for some form of social drinking is proved by the existence of the speakeasy. Beer 
which can only be guzzled in the privacy of one's home will not eliminate the speakeasy...The American substitute for the saloon may be a 'beer 
parlor,' such as may be found in several of the Canadian Provinces...As it is impossible to image the speakeasy continuing indefinitely as an illegal 
institution, it seems reasonable to expect that, in New York, at least, the drinking place of the future will serve strong drink as well as beer and
 light wines. But it will not be, in the old meaning of the word, a saloon. Probably, like most present-day speakeasies, it will be a restaurant. The 
art of cooking may be revived, since with profits from the sale of drinks restaurant proprietors can afford to lose or break even on the sale of food 
alone. But mainly the difference between the new saloon and the old will like in the refining and restraining., if also intriguing, presence of women 
in most drinking places. Once man was able to take the jungle when he became temporarily tired of the distaff side of his family. Later he took to 
the saloon. Prohibition destroyed that last refuge; repeal will not restore it. The drinking place of the future will be co-educational." <br>

Prohibition ended December 5, 1933. Almost immediately, newspapers, magazines and cookbooks generously poured recipes for 
perfect cocktail parties.
<p>
<b>[1934] </b><br>
"In the pre-war days the cocktail was a pre-dinner drink, now it precedes almost everything; sometimes it just appears from out of the nowhere and with no 
excuse." (p. 45)..."A cocktail is an American invention and not one to be particularly proud of, for strangely enough, a cocktail to be good, must be so cold it can
 hardly be tasted. However, a cocktail is a social drink and it has increased in popularity a hundredfold since Prohibition made it 'smart.' A modern cocktail is a fruit 
juice with synthetic gin or raw apple brandy; it is made every way in every place and is drunk before, after and between meals. Probably the original cocktail was
 what is now called an 'old fashioned' one; next came the 'Manhattan' then the ''Martini' followed by a 'Bronx,' and from then on, most anything. These formulae are 
presented for their historic value only or in case the age of reason returns."<br> 
---<i>The Gun Club Cook Book, or a Culinary Code for Appreciative Epicures</i>, Charles Browne, revised edition [Charles Scriber's Sons</i>:New York] 
1934 (p. 262-263)<br>
[NOTES: (1) The Gun Club was located in Princeton, NJ. (2) The title page of this book credits Mr. Browne as 'Sometimes Mayor of Princeton; one time Member of 
Congress; A.M., M.D., and some other things, but primarily interested in cookery."]

"Now that every one may drink with a clear conscience, many hostesses are wondering what to serve with the various beverages. With cocktails before dinner, 
very dainty canapes should be served. These an be made with caviar decorated and flavored with chopped hard-boiled egg, cooked mushrooms, lemon juice or a
 little minced onion. Canapes of anchovy paste or other fish pastes are appropriate. Little pearl onions, stuffed olives, or sweet pickles can be served. Toasted 
crackers with little dabs of Welsh rarebit, served hot, are delicious. If one is entertaining in the afternoon or evening at a so-called 'cocktail party' when highballs 
are served, the drinks may be accompanied by sandwiches. Thin slices of buttered bread, with a layer of chopped water cress seasoned with a little lemon juice or 
mayonnaise are rolled up and tied with a green ribbon. Cucumbers marinated in French dressing and flavored with a tiny bit of chopped onion makes an excellent
 sandwich filling. Another good filling consists of a cup of finely chopped celery with a tablespoon each of chopped apples, nuts, or olives, mixed with mayonnaise.
 All sandwiches should be daintily prepared. No sweet sandwiches are appropriate...Don't try to entertain you guests. If they are interesting and interested they will
 entertain themselves. Try to appear as if the entertaining was the easiest thing in the world. You may suffer qualms and trepidations about your party , but never let
 it be known. With respect to the drinks, Americans are becoming more and more European in their attitude toward highballs. They should be mixed to taste well,
 and to be enjoyed...using the best materials you can afford...you need have no qualms."<br>

<b>[1935]</b><br>
"One of the odd developments of our thirteen-year 'drought' was the increasing popularity of the cocktail habit: the mixing of this
potent drink was always a favorite topic of converstaion. Today, with foreign lands andour own distilleries contributing more and more
varieties of liquors to its concocting, the mixing of cocktails is becoming more of an art than ever before. And the cocktail party,
which usually begins late in the afternoon and lasts for a few hours at least, is now and established institution...Tradition traces
the cocktail to Mexico. It is said that an Aztec chief, on receiving a delectable stimulating drink named it a 'xoctl,' after the 
maid who brought it to him. And incredible legend this, as the New World had no distilled liquors until the white man 
brought his firestarter. One might as reasonably attribute the coctail to the lost Atlantis. Washington Irving refers to a colorfu
gin drink of the early Dutch setters of New York which had the iridescence of the rear plumage of roosters--hence, some people say,
the name 'cocktail.' Another legend is that the cocktail was first offered 'well shaken before taking' at the Wayside Inn at
Scarsdale, N.Y. The mixer was Betsy Flanagan. According to this legend also the various hues of the liquors used were responsible for 
the name. Whatever its origin, the cocktail has been recognized everywhere as an early American work, and its creation has enlisted the
highest talent. Nathanie Hawthorne in his novel, 'The Blithesdale Romance' (1852), makes honorable mention of a man as 
'being famous for nothing but gin cocktails and commanding a fair salary for that one accomplishment.' An attempt to take from this
country the credit of inventing the appetizer has been made in behalf of Engand. It is based on certain passages in the 
Thackaray novels
describing the adventures of one Arthur Pendennis. Harry Foker is advised to take 'some cocktail.' Thackeray's knowledge of the 
American drink was only literary and he probably never tasted a cocktail until 1852, when he was in the United States on his first
lecture tour. An honest mistake may have been made by those who have heard that certain palate-provoking elixers were first
compounded at the Pendennis Club, named in honor of the Thackeray hero. That club, however, was not in London, but in Louisville, 
Ky. and was famed for its mint juleps. Cocktails, however, were drunk in the United States long before the Pendennis was 
founded, and were enjoyed in New England and New York in various guises. They were served thoroughy iced. The geniuses of the American
drinking bar have evolved a thousand cocktails of varied flavors and picturesque names. Albert S. Crockett, historian of the old
Waldorf-Astoria, gives the recipes of more than 300 served at that hotel alone. New plays, news events, sports, popular songs, 
have inspired their titles. The 'cocktail hour' not ony whets the appetite for food, but also satisfies it. One need never leave it
hungery. With the many drinks are eaten delicate gastronomic bits--caviar, anchovies, rare cheeses, red salmon roe, crisp crackers and
biscuits; constant processions of tempting canapes and hors d'oeuvres passed on trays, in seemingly undiminished numbers.
The cocktail hour has qualified as a social institution."<br>

table set with a simple cloth for protection and a tray bearing the ncessary mixing ingredients and utensils...The filled glasses are
passed on a tray holding an equivalent number of diminutive cocktail napkins. Each guests removes a napkin with the drink as it is 
presented to him. Drip protectors may include coasters or some composition of impervious to stains from alcohol, or they may be crochedted or 
knitted 'jackets' which fit over the foot or base of the class. Coasters are passed with the drinks and each guest is requsted to take one to use
underneath his drink for protection of the table tops. The 'jacket' type of drip protectors are fieed to the glasses before passing 
them...At a cocktail party the food served is rightfully termed 'snacks.' Besides varieties of simple crackers, salted nuts, olives and
popcorn, any savory canape may put in an appearance...Sandwiches if served should be very small in size to whet the appetite rather than
appease it. Sweets, including cake in any form, or candy, are not for the cocktail party--not, as one might suppose, because they are too
lady-like; simply that they interfere with the enjoyment of substantial food which properly follows cocktails, either at dinner, or at

<b>World's Fair Fare, New York City, 1939</b>
<br>
"Consider for a moment the herculean task of feeding 50,000,000 people. Yet that is the number of visitors expected at the New York World's Fare of 
1939. Statisticians predict that each visitor will spend seven to seven and one-half hours within the grounds per visit. Since
during a period of seven hours the average person eats at least twice, the imagination staggers at the amount of food that will be
consumed each day at the Fair. Considering, further, the well-known effect of fresh air and exercise upon the appetite, it is not 
unlikely that many will eat a third time. Architects planning restaurants figure in acres, dietitians in tons...Comfortably to ffe this
multitude is a gigantic undertaking. Eighty restaurants wtih a total seating capacity of 43,200 will be necessary to meet the
need...To ally any lurking feat that the cost of eating at the fair may be prohibitive, let it be said that plans have been made to
fit every pocket-book. There will be hot dogs and hamburgers; snack bars, sandwich bars, beer gardens. One company will specialize in
hot roast beef sandwiches. There will be moderate-priced table d'hote meals and all kinds of dining up to and including the de luxe.
There need be no disappointment for those people who can never forget that perfect dish found in a little French restaurant, or
those who long to taste again the Rijstaple of the Netherland's far-off and exotic East Indies. Americans in recent years have become
fond of dining al fresco, and this prediliction has not been forgotten in the planning of eating places...One of the most
interesting, as well as one of the largest, of the restaurants will boast an American cuisine, and to make ordering easy for guests from 
across the seas there will be waiters fluent in a dozen different tongues...Of importance in the pageant of American food will 
be that which comes from the sea...for New York can provide some of the finest seafood in the world. Inspite of the profuse offerings of
luxuries to be found upon the menus at the Fair, there will be some visitors with less experimental palates...For them there is to be
a restaurant where under one roof may be found special local dishes from twenty sections of the United States...The foreign groups will do their part to 
gratify all types of palates, even the most curious. In fact, it will be possible on the Flushing Meadows to take a gourmet's trip around
the world. ...Among the exotic setting will be the Japanese...vistors may consume sukiayki...or the more elaborate feast which is called
by the Japanese "banquet food."...In the Italian section there will be two restaurants, the favorite spaghetti to be served inone, and tin the 
other formal Italian dishes...Perhaps the Swedish and Norwegian smorgasbords might be called the ultimate in snack bars...
Rumania hopes to import game; Belgium's offering will include her excellent sorrel soup...There will be Turkish coffee,...hot
chile con carne from Mexico. From Greece will come liquors and rare fruits, and an unforgetable delight will be the strawverries from the 
little Grand Duchy of Luxembourg--strawberries dripping ripe, in Moselle wine. France will serve French food de luxe in an 
equally de luxe setting...[serving] turbot of sole, souffle au rhum, lobster thermidor, poulet farci en cocotte..."<br>

The 1940s were all about rationing, protein stretching, substitutions, rediscovering "grandma's foods", and making do with less.
Home cooks made sugarless cookies, <a href="fooddecades.html#egglesscake">eggless cakes</a>, and meatless
meals. Cookbooks, magazines,
government pamphlets, and food company brochures were full of creative ideas for stretching
food supplies. Why the shortage? Food was needed to food soldiers fighting World War II.
Farmers and food manufacturers were tapped to supply growing military needs, thus creating a
shortage of foods available for domestic civilian consumers.
<p>
<a name="40rations">
<b>Food rationing</b><br>
Rationing was introduced in the United States by the Office of Price Administration in 1942 as a
way to equitably distribute diminishing food supplies. It ended in <a href="fooddecades.html#rationing1947">1947</a>. The
American government encouraged homeowners to create Victory Gardens, small plots of fruits
and vegetables to supplement personal and community food supplies. Nutrition information was
also widely disseminated to help home cooks create balanced meals for their families. The
<a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/Lunch/AboutLunch/ProgramHistory_5.htm#APPROVED">National School Lunch Act</a> was passed in 1946, extending Roosevelt's New Deal WPA
committment to feeding America's hungry children to ensure a healthy future.
<p>
<a name="chicken1945">
<b>Why was chicken more expensive than beef in the USA during WWII?</b><br>
In all places and times, prices are determined by supply and demand. During WWII, chickens producers were 
required by law to divert the majority of their birds to suppling US military. This resulted in product 
scarcity for civilian consumers, which drove prices up. The Office of Price Administration (OPA) tried 
regulating these prices. Chicken industry leaders fought back. "The current shortage of poultry for 
consumers has been due largely to two regulations, one of which directed the sale of all broilers in eight 
leading poultry-producing states to the Government for military use, and the other ordered the canning of 
seventy million pounds of boned chicken and turkey for the services. A total of about 250,000,000 pounds of
 poultry will be needed to fill the two orders." <br>---"Chicken Prices Will Rise 1 1/2 Cents," <i>New York 
Times</i>, March 24, 1945 (p. 20) 

<p>
<a name="rationing1947">
USA food rationing ended in 1947. The last item lifted from this regulation was sugar:<br>
"Secretary of Agriculture Clinton P. Anderson in a sudden move late today ended household and institutional sugar rationing effective at 12:01 A.M. tomorrow. 
Rationing to industrial users of sugar continues and price controls on sugar and related products are not affected by the order. Today's action market the end of a
 war-rationing system which went into effect in April, 1942."<br>
---"Rationing of Sugar Ended Except for Industrial Use," Bess Furman, <i>New York Times</i>, June 12, 1947 (p. 1) <br>
[NOTE: Historic newspaper databases are excellent resources for identifying exact dates for rationing milestones for particular commodities. Your local public 
librarian can help you connect. You might be able to do this from home!]

<p>
After the war, many new products were introduced to the American public. These "convenience
foods" (dehydrated juice, instant coffee, cake mixes, etc.) were the result of military research.  
Not all of these were embraced enthusiastically. Some traditional home cookes preferred returning to the
"old fashioned" way once rationed ingredients appeared on their local grocery shelves. 
<p>
Other countries also faced similar shortages due to World War II. The United Nations created the
<a href="http://www.fao.org/UNFAO/e/wmain-e.htm"> Food and Agriculture Organization</a>
in 1945 to combat hunger around the world.

<b>How did WWII rationing effect American restaurants?</b><br>
Food service establishments (restaurants, hotels, hospitals, schools, cafes) were subject to rationing from 1943-1946. The
 rules & formulas were very different
 from civilian home use. Restaurant were issued "Red Points" by the federal government based on the number of meals/customers served. People paid money, not points, for meals outside the 
home. Generally, restaurants could "spend" these points any way they wanted. Customers used money, not ration books, to
pay for meals. In one case, it was suggested that resort guests "pool" their points for aggregate feeding. This appears to
 be a suggestion, not a regulation.

<p>
Other foodservice issues included (1) price ceilings (OPA), (2) "meat fixing" (best cuts were directed to fancy hotels not 
supermarkets) (3) labor shortages (cooks, waiters,
 bar managers were now soldiers leaving other/newly trained staff to take their place (4) Fewer people in this "make do" 
economy could afford to eat out. Many restaurants shuttered permanently.
<p>
Period newspapers chronicled these complicated issues: <a href="rationing1.pdf">1</a>, <a href="rationing2.pdf">2</a> & <a href="rationing3.pdf">3</a>.
<p>
<a href="http://www.ciachef.edu/about/history.asp">The Culinary Institute of America</a> was founded in 1946 to provide
WWII veterans with professional training.

<b>USO canteen fare</b><br>

USO canteens were true community efforts. Most of the food was donated. The fare was generally simple (sandwiches, hamburgers, hot dogs, pie, cake, coffee, 
&c.) and portable. The primary rule was "Have enough." 
<p>
Below please find general descriptions of USO canteen fare served in two major US urban locations:
<p>
"The food here...is donated--some by businessmen, supplying milk, coffee, meat, candy, fruit and so on, and the rest by housewives or clubs, many of which 
undertake to provide cookies, cakes or pies every week. This is a big-city adventure in small-town collaboration--the center is run exactly on the principle of a 
small-town church social, in which Mrs. Jones bakes the cake, Mrs. Smith makes the veal loaf, and Mrs. Brown leads the dishwashing committee. The only 
difference is in size--hundreds of Mrs. Joneses bake cakes for this one. It takes food in sizable amounts. On busy week end found the canteen serving 2300 cakes, 
1250 pounds of hot dogs, 1475 hot-roast-beef sandwiches, 1700 pies, 450 pounds of cookies and 525 dozen doughnuts--all contributed. It took 185 pounds of 
coffee to supply the demand, and in addition the boys drank 300 gallons of milk, which is a favorite tipple in this spot. On the side, they ate seventy-five pounds of
 popcorn, potato chips and pretzels, 195 dozen ice cream cups, ten cases of oranges, fourteen boxes of apples and 500 pounds of candy...Mrs. Edward J. Kelly,  
wife of Chicago's mayor, brought a cake to the canteen one day just after Pearl Harbor, and found the volunteer workers were running out of food...she threw her 
mink coat on a chair, rolled up her sleeves and began working twelve hours a day. As chairman of the canteen, she has a remarkable staff of volunteer helpers, 
ranging from society matrons to their own maids, contributing maid's day off. It was Mrs. Kelly who contributed what many of the lads regard as the final touch to 
Chicago's hospitality. Some of the center's guests ate fast and hard, as if not sure where their next meal as coming from. Soemtimes they stashed a spare hot dog in 
their pockets to eat later. Mrs. Kelly inaugurated a new service. She began packing box lunches for the hungry ones to take along when they left. Service ment 
stationed in or near Chicago, or in the city on leave, frequently spent the entire week end in the center, taking breakfast, lunch and dinner there. Their choice of diets 
sometimes startles the women behind the counter. There was the yeoman, for example whose favorite breakfast consisted of Swiss cheese on rye with vanilla ice 
cream. Boys from the RAF never fail to try hot dogs, having read that their King and Queen ate this odd American delicacy when visiting the United States..."
<br>---"Chicago Throws a Party," <i>Saturday Evening Post</i>, July 18, 1942 (p. 62)
<p>
"Women provide treats...women's groups send enough home-made cake for each day in the month. Not intended to substitute for the army mess but to offer 
"treats," the canteen serves, besides cake, sandwiches, coffee, milk, punch and occasionally candy and fresh fruit. The soldiers heartily endorsed the canteen's 
offerings."<br>
---"14,000 Service Men Guests of Brooklyn USA in Month," Catherine Maher, <i>New York Times</i>, November 29, 1942 (p. D3)
<p>
<b>Food suggestions for local organizers, party planners, and home-based fundraisers for hosting war-time events:</b><p>
"When it's time to serve, bring forth those perennial masculine favorites. If you are having a hot dish, serve cheese frankfurters, tomato rarebit, spaghetti, hamburgers
 or baked stuffed potatoes. Pile stacks of sandwiches on the table, or spiced bread and a selection of cheeses. Original dishes are appealing since soldires get tired 
of unimaginative eating, substantial and nutritive though army fare is. Consider distributing your refreshments in  individual paper bags. If you can get waxed apper, 
wrap thick sandwiches in it, together with cake and cookies, paper spoon, and napkin, and any ice cream cup. Pass piping hot coffee separately. You can handle 
large crowds this way, especially if you have each woman in the community wrap several such food bundles before the party. All the cleaning up necessary is a
 quick collection of paper bags, which is just a few minutes' work. For soldiers with a sweet tooth, try Honey Ice Cream or Honey Marshmallows. Hot pie are 
applause winners, always. Honey Spice Cake is delicious, easy to prepare, and kind to your sugar ration. Even if the boys don't have a lean and hungry look, they 
never get their fill of good strong coffee and cake. Make the food simple and adequate and the boys will return to camp 
pleased with your hospitality. (p. 18-19)
<p>
"Party decorations, no moatter how simple, are important to identify the occasion and to set the theme of your party...You need not think of party
decorations in terms of lavish, expensive materials. Wonderful effects may behad wtih a few rolls of ordinary crepe paper, leaves
and branches, flowers, and other economical items...Patriotic partes: Red, white, and blue bulbs in lamps will cast a lovely light
an carry out the theme...Streamers in these colors strung across the room will give it a really festive look...Pin streamers across
your tablecloth in diagonal strips or pinwheels to accompany the individual favors which may be little flags, paper hats, or snappers
of appropriate color and design. Hang a large flag out of the front window to help you guests identify your house and to add
further to the decoration." (p. 47,49)
<p>
<a name="canteenbuffet">
"Simple Wartime Menus...simple dinners for special occasions are in keeping with the times. More than ever, it is important
to serve attractively so that the simplest meal will be appealing and appetizing...instead of fancy appetizers, you will start
your wartime dinners with wholesome fruit and vegetable juices, fresh fruit cups, cheese puffs, or nourishing soups. Well-cooked,
economical cuts of meat dressed with delicious sauces and flavorings will replace expensive courses. The little touches such as 
crisp relishes, hot rolls, and homemade jellies will enhance the wholesome main dish. Honey-flavored pies, ice creams, cakes, and
cookies, fresh fruits in season, and stewed fruit compotes are rich in taste and allow variety for desserts. Altogether, the adjustments
you make will not diminish the pride you take in serving delicious food, well cooked...Buffet Suppers. A buffet supper lends itself
to almost any kind of entertaining. No matter how large the crowd, you can accomodate everyone with a generous hot dish accompanied
by rolls or sandwiches and a crisp salad, with cookies or cake for dessert. Be sure th have plenty of hot coffee or tea ready...<br>

<b>Cocktails & hos d'oeuvres</b><br>
Prohibition recently repealed, Great Depression in full swing, World War II looming in the near future. Americans took 
this time to create a new ways to entertain. The Cocktail Party, as we Americans know it today, was perfected in this decade.
James Beard's detailed instructions for hosting <a href="cocktail40s.pdf">successful cocktail parties</a>, includes 15

<a href="tradervic.html">Trader Vic's exotic conconctions</a>, 1946.
<p>
<b>What to serve?</b><br>
"In America since the repeal of the Prohibition Amendment there has developed a new and, at times, delightful form of hospitality--the cocktail party. With this has 
come the use of the age old French term from 'outside the meal' food. But instead of huge buffets groaning with succulent morsels, as in European homes 
(formerly!), the age old appetizer has become streamlined along with our trains and automobiles and living. We have developed a most amazing variety of finger 
food to go with the cocktail and the glass of sherry, literally hundreds of variations, some of course borrowed from our European and Asiatic backgrounds and 
many that are distinctly our own. In many ways this is one of the most truly American contributions to the art of good living. It is with this finger food that I am 
concerned in this book and with the cocktail party, whether it be the simple 'drop in for a drink' type or the great 'crush' that pays a year's social depts in one fell 
swoop. To the average American hostess, practically everything from a potato chip to a whole, six-rib roast of beef comes under the term hors d'oeuvre...
Americans have developed what is known as the cocktail hors d'oeuvre ro snack. This is a small 'hasty bite' served usually without bread or biscuit, sometimes on a
 toothpick and sometimes under its own power. Hot hors d'oeuvre may be eaten with a fork, as they often have a heavy sauce or a marinee."<br>

<b>[1941]<br>
"Tea and Cocktails. </b><br>
The cocktail hour is one of our American inventions...The first requisite for a party is good liquor. The second is
plenty of it. Don't try substituting the second recommendation for the first. Lots of people do that, and for that
reason lots of men shy away from the cocktails they are offered a parties. They prefer to do their drinking at a
bar where they can see the bottle form which their drinks are poured. Good liquor is not cheap. Cheap liquor is
not good. Nor will a lot of very fancy canapes make up for poor drinks...If you're entertaining on a shoestring and
have to count the pennies very carefully, then why go in for cocktails at all? Why not be smartly proletarian and
have beer on tap or ready to serve from cold bottles, complete with hearty foods? Or, if your friends are
connoissuers of wine, why not have some very good white wine and ask your friends in to try this with some dry,
slightly sweet biscuits or sponge cake? Or hunt about for one of the very little known Swedish punches-and
these are powerful too. Build your party around this with some really Swedish hors d'oeuvres, arranged as
smoregasbord. 
     But let us say that you have decided to give your friends cocktails, and the best of their kind. The immediate
question is which kind. At the River Club in New York, as the bartender told me, the six most popular mixed
drinks are: bacardi cocktails, daiquiris, dry martinis, manhattans, old-fashioned cocktails and whisky sours.
Usually, and for even a fairly large party, dry martinis, with whiskey and soda highballs, sherry, iced fruit juice and
milk for the many who are on diets but who like going to parties just the same, offer something for every taste.
You can mix martinis just before the party and have them ready to pour into cracked ice to be stirred round and
round when the guests begin to arrive. Martinis are always stirred, not shaken. An olive is dropped into the glass;
the cocktail is poured over it; a thin slice of lemon rind is twisted above the glass to let one drip of the pungent oil
fall into it, and the martini is ready.
     There's an exact ritual about the glasses for various drinks. Men are proverbially particular about this point.
Perhaps you can't honestly feel that it's a life-or-death matter to serve each drink in its properly ordained glass,
but probably your husband does...If you are having your firends come to the house for cocktails it is well to have
tea, too, since a number of people really prefer it to any othe drink during the afternoon...What to serve with
cocktails? Since Repeal American ingenuity has been at work inventing canapes that cause foreigners to gasp at
our temerity. Daring combinations of oysters, peanut butter, caviar, anchovies and melted cheese are set out to
betray the unwary into indigestion."<br>

"Canape spread-your-owns</b><br>
An informal way of serving a first course of canapes is to arrange several canape spreads each in a
small, attractive bowl. Arrange the bowls on a tray, along with individual butter spreads. Put the
tray on a convenient table in the living room. Beside it, arrange plates of assorted crackers, with
toasted bread, Melba toast, bread sticks, potato chips, celery sticks or, if desired, halves of
hard-cooked eggs from which the yolks have been removed and used in one of the spreads. Then
let
the guests spread their own canapes and fill their own celery sticks and eggs, to be eaten with fruit
juice, vegetable juice, or other cocktails. Or if you are having a leisurely meal and can take a little
more than the usual time for the first course, bring in your toaster, and toast crisp hot pieces of
bread for the assorted spreads in bowls. In fact, you can buy a combination toaster and tray with
several dishes designed to hold assorted canape spreads. Such spread-your-owns are excellent too
as an afternoon snack, served with tea or coffee." (p. 109)
<p>
Spread recipes offered by this book are: avocado, blue and cream cheese, crabmeat, cream cheese
and egg, giblet and egg, ham and olive, mock pate de foie gras (made with liverwurst), sardine
and egg, sherry cheese, and "spread-your-own," (chopped frankfurters blended with mustard,
sour pickles, and mayonnaise). (p. 109-111)
<p>
<b>"Hors D'Oeuvres</b><br>
Hors d'oeuvres, like canapes, should be of such a size that they can be easily eaten in one or two
mouthfuls. You may arrange two or three varieties on a tray as an accompaniment to a first
course of fruit juice, vegetable juice or other kinds of cocktails, served in the living room before
luncheon, dinner, or supper. Frequently one or several kinds of hors d'oeuvres which can be easily
eaten with the fingers are arranged on a platter and passed to each guest, at the table, as an
accompaniment to the first course of tomato juice, clam juice, or similar cocktail, which is in place
at each cover just before or after the guests sit down. If you want something unusual as a
refreshment for an afternoon or evening party, a club meeting or afternoon tea--try serving an
assortment of hors d'ouvres such as those which follow with a cup of tea or coffee, or with a
cooling vegetable juice or fruit juice cocktail." (p. 111-2)
<p>
Hors d'oeuvre recipes offered by this book are: apple and salami porcupine, cheese pecans,
chicken liver and bacon, cocktail sausages, dried beef roulades, green or ripe olives in garlic
French dressing, potato chip snappies (bleu cheese and minced onion spread thinly on potato
chips), raw carrot-cheese, raw vegetable hors d'oeuvre platter, salami sandwiches, shrimp (served
with cocktail or horseradish sauce), stuffed celery stalks stuffed with cream cheese & crushed
pineappe, seedless raisins, minced onion, horseradish, bleu cheese, salmon or any of the above
canape spreads), stuffed cheese olives, stuffed olives and bacon, stuffed olives in anchovy butter.
<p>
<b>Fruit, fish and vegetable cocktails</b><br>
"Fruit and fish cocktails are often served in cocktail glasses, designed for the purpose, which fit
into bowls holding crushed ice. If these are not available however, or a simple service is desired,
sherbet glasses may be used instead. In either case, arrange the bowl or sherbet glass on a small
plate, and then place on the service plate at each cover, either just before the guests sit down or
immediately thereafter. They oyster fork for the the fish cocktail, or the spoon for the fruit
cocktail, should be placed at the extreme right of the silver at the right of the service plate. Juice
cocktails such as tomato, vegetable, or fresh or canned fruit juice may also be served in cocktail
glasses set in bowls of crushed ice. Or, simple cocktail glasses without the bowls for ice may be
used...Many hostesses like to serve a first course of tomato, vegetable, or fruit juice, or other
cocktail with or without a few hors d'oeuvres...in the livingroom. The juice cocktail in cocktail
glasses is passed, with a small cocktail napkin for each guest, from a tray. A small plate may be
placed under each cocktail glass if desired. Then the hors d'oeuvres, one or more as preferred
(select ones which can be eaten with the fingers) are passed from plate or platter. In serving such
a first course in the living room, the hostess without a maid has an opportunity to slip out and get
the main course on the table, while the guests are enjoying their cocktails." (p. 117)
<p>
Cocktail recipes offered by this book are: avocado, bouquet (chilled melon balls, bananas, grapes,
orange & grapefruit), broiled grapefruit with sherry, chilled honeydew, grapefruit and avocado,
grapes in orange juice, halves of grapefruit, melon balls in grapefruit juice, red raspberry and
pineapple, cranberry and pineapple juice, grape juice and ginger ale, grapefruit juice and mint,
minted orange juice, pineapple and grape juice, pineapple lemon foam, spiced grape juice, clam,
crabmeat, crabmeat and avocado, shrimp mayonnaise, clam juice, clam and tomato juice, oysters
on the half shell, sauerkraut juice, tomato juice, tomato and sauerkraut juice." (p. 118-126)<br>

"An Englishman orders whisky and soda, an Italian vermouth, a Scandinavian aquavit, a Russian vodka and an American--well, almost anything that combines many things. Our taste
for mixing alcoholic beverages is kown the globe around; the cocktail is as much a part of the national scene as the World Series and the drug store that sells
everything but refrigerators. Here in New York, entertainment capital of the country, restaurants, night clubs and hotels often cater to our predilection for mixed
drinks by featuring at least one as their specialty. For example, the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel not only has the Waldorf-Astroia cocktail, but also the Waldorf cocktail, the New
Waldorf cocktail and the Astoria cocktail, in addition to six others!...Astoria Cocktail: 1/2 part gin, 2/3 part French vermouth, Two dashes orange bitters. Stir with ice, 
strain and serve."<br>

"Cocktail Parties.
La Brinvilliers, a notorious poisoner, was beheaded for her crimes. According to a French wit, the only
difference between La Brinvilliers and the average cook is the intention. This is particularly true of
menu building, wherein many a hostess sins grievously, but at a "help yourself" party she may give her
fancy free reign and let her guests assume full responsibility. Alcoholic or non-alcoholic cocktails--either or both. A choice of the following suggestions:
Stuffed celery, Olives, Radishes, Marinated mushrooms, Hot ripe olives, Potato chips and cheese
Antipasto, Lobster spread sandwiches, Caviar and cucumber canapes, Very small hot toasted
sandwiches or puff shells (mushroom, cream cheese, liversausage, oysters etc.), Codfish balls, Tiny
broiled sausages with mustard cream, Chicken livers in blankets, Broiled sardine canapes, Deviled

<b>A Luau on the Mainland, Trader Vic style</b><br>
After WWII, returning GIs spread the word of exotic foods to their friends and families. <a href="statefoods.html#luau">Hawaiian
luaus</a> were among the most intriguing. Savvy restauranteurs and trendy 
hostesses embraced the opportunity to explore different flavors, optimize creative decorations, and introduce alternative dining 
customs. Trader Vic (Victor Bergeron) built an empire on this premise. Polynesian-stlyle theme parties remained popular
into the early 1960s. Here are Trader Vic's party notes for USA home hostesses, circa 1946:
<p>
"Sunday afternoon or any evening--it's all the same. If you have a patio and barbecue pit, by all means make it an outdoor
affair, the weather permitting, but indoors won't cramp your style any. Indoors or out, you'll want plenty of flowers and greens for
decoration, and it will mean gathering flowers from the gardens of your friends as well as stripping your own. If you're in the chips and want to spend
great gobs of dough you'll use nothing but orchids, anthurium, gardenias, bird-of-paradise, and hibiscus and perhaps have ginger and 
pikaki leis flown over from Honolulu, but I'm assuming that you will hae more sense than money and are willing to let the
toil of your own lily-whites make up for the difference. Put flowers wherever they will be seen--on top of fence rails, cupboards, 
window sills, and on shelves. Use greens and flowers of all kinds in profusion to give a tropical effect, a feeling of lush
abundance. You'll need loads of flat ferns or any large leaves for the table to take the place of ti and banana leaves used on the islands.
If you can collect enough of them, spread these broad leaves on the floor to walk on and ask your guests beforehand to come in white ducks
or pareus and be prepared to remove their shoes upon entering.
<p>
"If you party is to be held indoors, put away all the doodads and bric-a-brac. Just leave the furniture and give every room your
guests will see a liberal flower treatment, even the lalas. Paper leis can be combined with fresh flowers and greens and you can ask a 
few close friends over the day before the feast to help you make flower leis, one for each guest. Leis can be made from any flowers that
mass well and don't wilt too quickly, such as daisies, marguerites, carnations, cornflowers, chrysanthemums, dahlias, pinks, asters, et
cetera. The stems are removed and the flower heads are threaded on strong thread with a large needle. These leis can be put in boxes
of wet newspapers and kept fresh in a cooler or icebox overnight. A refrigerator would be too cold, making the blossoms wilt
more quickly when removed from such a low temperature...Its a custom in the islands for the host and hostess to present each guest with a 
flower lie and a kiss. The host takes dare of the women and the hostess gubers the men. Like our mistletoe at the Christmas
season, this limbers the reflexes and starts things off on a friendly basis. In addition the men are given crowns of flowers and the
women flowers for their hair. The wreaths give the men a rakish air and bring out the madcap in the most sedate. It has been by
observation that no man can be still with something on his head. When or by whom party hats were invented I don't know, but
whoever it was knew his psychology. And that's a tip for harried hostesses when confronted with a guest list of stuffed shirts. Just put
something on their heads...the wreaths...[are] made from a flat sword fern wired or tied together in a circle and studded with
small flowers--daisies, cornflowers, or whatever you happen to have.
<p>
"Contrary to the usual custom of keeping the dining room closed off as a surprise until the meal is served, guests should be taken
immediately to see the results of your labors and the preparations made for their entertainment--and sample the punch. This will bet them
into the spirit of the party, especially the punch. And here should be a punch bowl, by all means. It doesn't matter whether you use
a wooden tub or a hollowed-out log, as long as it's seaworthy, because the sides won't show anyway. You canuse a large crock or take a large
lard bucket and have it sandblasted. Better still, get a twenty-five gallon barrel and saw it in hlaf. At any rate, use something
unique because you've thrown formality out the window for the day. Set your improvised punch bowl on a side table or buffet, covered first 
with greenery, then bank the sides of the container with coconuts, hands of bananas, wholepineapples, citrus fruits, limes, green
avocados, and small fruits as available. After that tuck flowers and green leaves around the edge of the bowl and in th crevices between
the fruits. For punch cups, use coconut shell cups or sections of bamboo sawed into cups. Coconut cups are easily made by sawing coconuts in 
half and allowing them to dry for a vew days until the meat comes loose from the shell. The outer husk can be sandpapered and the edges smoothed down. 
For holders, cut other coconuts into rings into which the cups can be set and not tip over. These same punch cups or whatever you
decide to use will be used throughout the meal to follow.
<p>
"Music isn't essential but soft island music will help set the tempo of your party. Perhaps someone you knows plays a ukeulele or
guitar, or you might even hire a musician for the day. A record player, stacked with records of Hawaiian music and turned down
low, will do the trick too.
<p>
"If your guests are yound and limber, spread the feast on the floor or round in true island style, but if their bones creak, trade
authenticity for comfort and use table and chairs. Forget the knives and forks. People seldom have a chance to eat with their fingers and
it's fun if everyone else is doing it. You'll have to plan your menu accordingly tough. Islanders may be able to manipulate such soft
foods as one-finger, two-finger, or three-finger poi, but amateurs won't take to the idea. In case you're wondering, that finger
business is a measure of the thickness of poi...Whether you spread your feast a floor level or on a table, use ti leaves, ferns, 
banana leaves, or whatever broad leaves are available, and make a solid green table covering. In the center build a mound of
fruits--lemons, oranges, bananas, avocados, small fruits, peaches, pears and apples, topped with a pineapple. If the table is long, 
several pineapples may be spaced at interval. Lay blossoms profusely among the fruit and down the center of the table. When you
get around to setting places, use one large plate, one smaller one, and the punch cup for each cover. Wooden plates and a large shell for the smaller plate will
add color and tropical atmosphere. Abalone shells are ideal and even those large scallop shells which are used for baked seafood are 
suitable. Small shells make good ask trays. You have now eliminated extra dishes, silverware, and numerous appertenances usually considered
musts at dinner parties, and you won't have to worry about the tablecloth. You'd better stick to napkins, though, unless you want to emulate the Chinese and
pass hot towels and a basin of hot water.
<p>
"I put on a party at Cypress Point, near Monterey, California, last year which is still being talked about. The food was takenfrom Oakland about
a hundred and twenty-five miles and prepared at the scene of the party. The cooking faciltiies were most inadequate, so anyone could do the same thing
at home a lot easier. On one clamshell I served hearts of romaine with French dressing. There were large wooden bowls of 
batter-fried shrimp, and small bowls of sauce in which to dip them. There were bowls of barbecued spareribs; bowls of chicken and
squab, roasted Chinese style, and bowls of banana fritters. The romaine salad compensated for the lack of vegetables and was eaten with the
fingers. For the dessert, in addition to the banana fritters, there were compotes of bite-sized fruits such as oranges, apples, and
pineapple chunks, with a marinade of curacao, which dould also be fished out with the fingers. I spread the tables with green
crepe paper overlaid with a quantity of sword fern and used profusions of great tuberous begonias in the center of the table
between the large wooden bowls of food and hurricane lamps. I served the punch in a long wooden canoe-shaped bowl. The punch itself was just a
lot of little Zombies ladled out into coconut cups. We finished off with hot buttered rums, coffee grogs, and Tahitian music
and dancing...
<p>
"If you've ever been to the islands, any of them, you know that the food described is not typical. I'm not claiming that it is, nor am
I suggestiong that you serve typical Hawaiian or Tahitian foods--not entirely at any rate. The menu does suggest the tropics, it is
delicious, and the manner in which it is served is typical of the islands, which is an important feature. Let me give you other
menus which could be used as given or adapted to whatever is available or most easily prepared...There's no hard-and-fast
rule about the thing at all.<p>
"<b>Menu</b> Bowls of fried or barbecued shrimp, Smoked oysters, Barbecue chicken or Barbecues Squab (chopped into easly handled pieces with a
cleaver), Limed fish with coconut cream, Laulaus with curry sauce, Baked sweet potaotes, Large bowls of sliced assorted fruits
(Pineapple, ornges, and apples dipped in lime juice.)" (p. 141-147)
<p>
"<b>Menu</b> Roast leg of lamb or Baked ham (Cut meatup in small squares andserve ina bow), Javanese sate (Meat on a stick), 
Batter-fried shrimps in a bowl, Limed fish with coconut cream, Tahitian Pota, Baked sweet potatoes, Baked bananas, Tahitian Fruit Poi." (p. 153)<br>

<b>Butterless, Eggless, Milkess cake</b><br>
The original inspiration of Butterless, Eggless, Milkless cake dates back to the Medieval Ages.
Spices and
raisins were popular ingredients of that time. Great cakes and steamed puddings are hundreds of
years old.
These recipes were introduced to America by European settlers. Early American cookbooks are
full of
recipes for spice cakes (aka rich cakes and great cakes). Did you know up until the late 19th
century
fruit/spice cakes were served as wedding cakes? 
<p>
Although thrifty pioneer cooks were well versed in "making do," recipes for  "Butterless, Eggless,
Milkless"
cakes begin to nudge their way into American cookbooks during the early years of the 20th
century. Why?
These ingredients were sometimes difficult to obtain from World War I through World War II,
and cakes
such as these were often served on family tables. Crisco, salad oil, lard, mayonnaise were the most
common substitutions for the butter (fat). Baking powder/soda substituted for the eggs (to make
the cake
rise) and water (or canned soup) was used instead of milk (liquid).  White sugar was also
expensive and
rationed during this period.  Brown sugar, corn syrup, honey and molasses were often substituted.
These cakes are found under a variety of names including "War Cake" and "Depression Cake."

<p>

"Depression cake. In the March 1989 issue of <i>Country Living</i>, Food Editor Joanne Lamb
Hayes
assembled a fascinating colleciton of recipes to show "how families coped in the kitchen during
the Great
Depression and wartime." This sugarless, eggless cake was developed during the First World
War. "Sugar,
the cheapest and most compact form of energy...was saved for our boys overseas, so creatie
cooks
learned to use molasses, honey, or corn syrup instead. For scarce wheat, they substituted barley,
oats, for
corn; for butter they used vegetable oil." When the Great Depression arrived, just eleven years
after the
Great War, this frugal cake was renamed Depression cake."<br>
---<i>American Century Cookbook: The Most Popular Recipes of the 20th Century</i>, Jean
Anderson
[Clarkson Potter:New York] 1997 (p. 441)<br>
[NOTE: this book contains a recipe for Depression cake.]

home cook how easy it is to incorporate Crisco into everyday recipes, including cakes.]

Period cookbooks and magazines tell us belly-filling simple meals prepared from pre-packaged
goods were popular in the 1950s.  This
was a perfectly understandable reaction to recent memories of lean pantries, government
rationing, and WWII soldier rations. American companies did their best to convince the "typical"
1950s American homemaker to purchase time-saving appliances and serve her family new
convenience foods. Did the average home cook buy into all this
convenience? Yes, but not immediately. She also liked to experiment and was intrigued by new
flavors and recipes introduced by returning GIs. Welcome to the age of Hawaiian-American
buffet. Food of the 1950s is much more complicated than it seems on the surface. We recommend
Laura Shapiro's <i>Something From the Oven:
Reinventing Dinner in 1950s America</i>. 
<p>
1950s cookbooks, food company brochures, and popular women's magazines confirm the
popularity of <a href="foodfaq.html#1950scasserole">tuna noodle </a> & <a href="foodfaq.html#greenbean">green bean</a>
casseroles frosted
meatloaf (frosted
with mashed potatoes!, served with 
peas)  and anything grilled...though mostly red meat...on the barbeque (a popular "new" suburban
trend). Family meals were accompanied by frozen vegetables, with lots of butter or sauce. Canned
soup reigned supreme as the ultimate combination of convenience and versatility, explaining the
proliferation of casseroles. Three bean salad was ubiquitous. <a
href="foodfaq.html#chexmix">Chex Mix</a> (also known as
Trix Mix, TV Mix) was the "signature" snack.
<p>
This decade also marked the beginning of ethnic foods entering mainstream America. GIs
returning from tours in Europe and the Pacific developed new tastes. Food companies were quick
to supply the ingredients. "Americanized" versions of sukiyaki, egg foo yung, chow mein,
enchiladas, pizza, lasagne, and barbecued meats with Polynesian sauces regularly appeared in
1950s cookbooks.

<b>Backyard barbecues</b><br>
After WWII, many returning GI's married and settled in the suburbs. A house with a back yard
was one of the symbols of American middle-class status. How best to show off one's back yard? Barbecue! It's
no coincidence men proudly did the grilling. Women did the planning and
prep-work based on suggestions offered by contemporary magazines and cookbooks. James Beard's <i>Complete Book of Barbecue &
Rotisserie Cooking</i> (c. 1954) was one of the "bibles" consumed by American home barbecue enthusiasts. What was served? 
Anything & everything. With flaming gusto!

"Eating outdoors is one of life's finest pleasures. It is not just a trick of the imagination that makes food smell and taste
better under blue skies or under the stars. The fire in your grill and the freshness of the air add savor to every dish, whether it
is served in a patio, a back yard, a picnic grove or on a stretch of sand or grass on lake, stream or ocean. Many people put a lot
of time and money into assembling equipment for outdoor cookery and construction elaborate outdoor kitchens in their yards or
patios. Though this can be fun for the ambitious handyman, it's not necessary. There are many portable grills and braziers on 
the market that will give you just as tasty a result as the most complicated 'made-to-order" job...The little Skotch Grille is one of the
simplest and most practical on the market. It is small-12 inches high and 12 inches across-and easy to carry. It cooks with charcoal
and the steaks, chops, hamburgers-or whatever you choose to cook-have that delicious flavor that only charcoal can give. The Skotch
Grill can be used any place outdoors can be easily carried to picnics, on camping or hunting or fishing trips, and can be used at
home in the fireplace...The Big Boy portable barbecue line includes everything from an 18-inch bowl-type charcoal brazier on 
wheels, at less than $25, up to a large barbecue unit, also on wheels, with seven motor-driven spits and a warming oven, at about
$300...Another interesting small charcoal unit for outdoor or indoor cooking is the Japanese hibachi. If there is a Japanese store in 
your area, ask to see them there. These little grills have been used for centuries in Japan for preparing the delicious native
barbecued dishes and sukiyaki...They are cast-iron tubs in little stands, many of which are quite decorative."<br>

"Does your husband love to put on a chef's hat when he is broiling a steak? Is he the only one who never forgets the
sherry in the soup? Is his pet story about the time he cooked for the boys when they all went fishing? Then for goodness
sake, give him a barbecue and watch his ego expand. And think what a conversation piece you've handed him. Interest in a 
barbecue can provide a substitute for those play-by-play descriptions of golf, football or fishing...Adding a barbecue to your household will provide an endless selection of gadgets to solve the gift problem of
Christmas, birthday or anniversary. An amateur chef is always enthusiastic about a new prop for his act."<br>

"Cocktails, long cold drinks such as highballs, and beer are the favorites among the alcoholic
beverages of this country. There are a few epicures who know and appreciate wines and who can
distinguish among vintages. Most of us are content with serving sherry, vermouth, or Dubonnet
before diner, and on special occasions offering an appropriate wine with a meal to which it adds
enjoyment. Sometimes a brandy or a cordial will also be served after coffee. There are a few
simple rules which should be followed in the service of beverages of this sort. The next few pages will
be devoted to the question of what to serve, when, and how. For more detailed informaiton, I refer
you to Along the Wine Trail, by G. Selmer Fougner, published by the Stratford Press, Boston, which
contains accurate and practical information...There are actually hundreds of recipes for cocktails.
You may go as far as you will in experimenting with them yourself, but be careful about offering
a strange mixture to guests, unless you have the makings of other drinks on hand that are hand
and are hospitable enough to allow them to choose something else. The two most popular
before-dinner cocktails are Martinis and Manhattans. Next perhaps come old-fashioneds, whiskey sours, and
daiquiris. If you make these according to the accepted practice, it will not be necessary to have
any more on your list of standbys. 
     Service of Cocktails: All cocktails except old-fashioneds are mixed with ice in a cocktail
shaker, but some of them are stirred instead of shaken. If you have only one shaker, Martinis and
Manhattans may be stirred and served in pitches from which they may be poured into the cocktail glasses in
the living room. Old-fashioneds may be mixed at the bar, if you have one, or in the kitchen, which is
easier, and where you generally have better results. They are brought to the living room on a tray.
To serve the usual type of cocktail, arrange the glasses of standard size, which may have long or
short stems, with the shaker on the tray. Small napkins should accompany them, and coasters may be
offered with them if you are particular about rings on your mahogany. A tray of canapes, savory
crackers, or an assortment of relishes should be offered with cocktails."<br>

<b>Popular trends & new drinks:</b><br>
"The greatest revolution of all...has been the change in the Martini. The first Martini was sweet
drink but the classic formula for the drink as we know it today was two parts gin and one part French
or dry vermouth. If you used that formula today you would more than likely lose a customer. This
[Mr. B. Paul] attributes to the American insistence on making Martinis increasingly more dry. "There
is no question that the most popular cocktail in the world today is the Martini. After that, the Old
Fashioned. The English also have a liking for straight drinks such as pink gin, which is gin with a
dash of Angostura bitters. The most popular drink in England is the gin and tonic; after that Scotch
and after that the Martini." He added...many customers still ask for a Bronx cocktail, a drink made
with equal parts gin, sweet vermouth and orange juice...."Then of course, there is the recent world
rage for the Bloody Mary. It is a drink that has a particular appeal to women although men like it too.
That and the screwdriver are the only two new drinks that have caught the public fancy in the last
two decades." He added, too, that the social climate has changed radically within the last thirty
years and this has accounted for some of the world's drinking habits...During this recent meeting of the
International Bartenders Association there was a fierce competition among the members to
concoct a new cocktail. The contest was won by a 27-year-old West Berliner, Dieter Waldman of the Hotel
Kempinski. The recipe follows:<br>
Kempinski Cocktail<br>
2 ounces grapefruit juice<br>
1 ounce Bacardi rum<br>
1 ounce Cointreau<br>
Fill a cocktail shaker half full with cracked ice and add the liquid ingredients. Shake well and
strain into two chilled cocktail glasses. Garnish each cocktail with a maraschino cherry. Yield: Two
Servings."<br>

<b>What food to serve?</b><br>
"It is important to have the beverages and the canapes compiment each other and with a little care in selection this can be accomplished...delicate floavors predominate champagne.

<b>Can we eat dinner in the TV room?</b><br>
In the 1930s-1940s, families listened to the radio while dining. After supper, they retired to the living room to enjoy favorite programs. 
Like furniture-grade console radios, most families placed TVs in the living room for general seating comfort. TV's allure, of course, was the visual component.
As post-war affuence rose, so did the acquisition of the family TV. This animated box changed American life, 
and by association dining patterns, forever. 
<p>
Television posed new challenges with timing (serving meals between "favorite shows") and location (TV trays in the living room). 
Period entertainment guides reveal a subtle ambivalence toward the affect of television on family life. Trendsetters embraced television, planning entire <a href="fooddecades.html#tvparties">home parties</a> around
the set. Savvy companies marketed novel lines of self-contained <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/tvdinner.html">TV dinners</a> and <a href="foodfaq.html#chexmix">
TV snack mixes</a>. 
<p>
Did television really "kill" the dinner hour, or did it facilitate an emerging meal pattern? Period newspapers promoted <a href="fooddecades.html#tvtrays">mobile tray dining</a> (get out of the dining 
room!). Pop up dining happened inside and out: verandas, porches, back yards, and television rooms.
The passsage below appears to bemoan the "intrusion" of television on family meals. Reading beween the lines, one senses a collective sigh parental relief.
Cooking & serving two settings (early for kids, later for adults) cavoided the stress of timing one family table. 
Kids were hungry long before commuting dads returned home. Dad needed some time to decompress when he arrived home from the office. The free "babysitter" in the living room may have been more welcome than nuisance. Before, during, and
 after dinner. Was dining in front of the TV the "norm?" Hard to say. Print media focuses on popular trends and new products.
<p>
<b>"Television--the Permanent Dinner Guest</b><br>
The most demanding guest ever to enter the American home is Television. It has disorganized family life, thrown tradition to the winds and as for the dinner hour, it is
ignored completely. Even discipline has been turned over to Television--the mere suggestion of being banished from a favorite program is enough to bring the most unrully
child into line. Yet try as you may, you can't squeeze Television into the old set of rulles. You can plan dinner at six and nothing happens--all eyes and ears are glued to the
screen. You moan like a martyr, you deliver an ultimatum, but it gains you nothing. Far better to outsmart the situation and join the ranks of enthusiasts. 'But how can I feed the 
children in time for their program yet avoid a hectic, hurried meal when Dad gets home from the office?' you ask. It can be done! Preparing one dinner and serving two takes
a certain amount of planning, that is at first. But once you get on to it, it can become an automatic routine. It is simply a matter of preparing one recipe but using two bowls or
serving dishes or dividing the food between individual baking dishes...Hamburgers can be seasoned and shaped for two dinners, wrapped in waxed paper or foil and stored in the refrigerator until
time to be fried or broiled. Even your tossed green salad can be mixed at one time yet with no danger of you and Dad being fed the left-overs. Just toss together the desired selection of 
greens, towl and chill until ready to be mixed with the dressing...The double boiler can be used when reheating vegetables cooked ahead of time or for keeping them hot for the second serving...
Serving meals while viewing television is no problem, that is if you use trays. (Trays are one investment which pay for themselves over and over again.) The kind I use are
made from pressed paper or composition board. They are inexpensive, durable, weigh practically nothing and are finished to look like fine-grained wood; also they are
liquor-prrof. You may decide to invest in a few of the larger size trays, large enough to hold a casserole, serving dish and salad bowl. These allow your entire dinner to 
be moved from kitchen to living room at one time and on one tray. In my kitchen I keep my flatware and napkins convenient to the place where the trays are stored. It takes only a
minute to set them up along 'the buffet' which is the name given to the open counter between the upper and lower cupboards in my kitchen...Now that we've arranged everything, where will
your family or guests eat; where will they put their trays? I shudder to think you would expect them to balance a tray on their knees. Your answer is tables. My daughter 
usus a huge coffee table placed in front of her television set. A similar idea but a differently constructed table is built like a long ench and is covered with individual
cushions. It is a perfect seat for viewing television. When the cushions are placed on the floor (Oriental fashion) as seats, the table is then ready for dining. 
You could build such a table yourself by using  a 2 foot wide plywood door, with iron legs and cushions of foam rubber. Or perhaps individual tables would be more to
your liking? If so, invest in one of those sets of four which hang from a rack or else a nest of tables which may be stored on inside the other. For the children's use, probably the 
cheapest answer would be those metal trays with legs attached--they are lightweight and colllpase for storing. As the clock strikes the hour, each child balances a tray and 
the processions moves into the realm of make-believe. You and Dad sink into comfortable chairs--far from the blare and blatt of the children's program--and enjoy a few minutes
of peace and quiet as you sip your cocktails. Later, as you dine in front of <i>your</i> program, you realize that at last your goal has been reached--the family has
found happiness under its own roof."<br>

<b>Suburban family bliss?</b><br>
"How log has it been since you have had a glamourous evening alone with our husband? A whole evening full of talk, good food, candlelight, soft music, and maybe a 
bottle of light, chilled wine. it sounds wonderful, doesn't it, but the budget is too trained and it's so difficullt to find someone to stay with the children. Then what
about a do-it-yourself project! Here's how it works in our house. Late in that afternoon I do all the preliminary cookinng, set the coffee table in the living room with a 
pretty cloth, my best china; and silver, and the candelabra from the mantle, and stakc the phonograph with record. After I have bathed the children and helped them into their
pajamas, I spend a little extra effort on my own dressing and make-up..By the time my husband comes home at 6 o'clock, I am dressed and relaxed and the children are happily 
eating a tray supper in front of the television set. This is a treat for them, especially when they are served hamburgers, fruit salad, carrot sticks, and an ice cream
bar for dessert. They consider this menu a real party and what could be easier for Mother. When the children finish their supper they usually go upstairs to watch Daddy shave and tell him
about their day. Then he reads them a story and tucks them into bed. This gives me time to broil a steak, mix the green salad, and dress the baked potatoes with sour cream 
and chives. While I bring the dinner into the living room on a large tray, my husband pours the wine, lights the candles, and flicks the switch on the phonograph. Now there we
are, away from the distractions of television, children, and friends, with time to really talk. Food never has tasted better...And what will this glamourous evening cost?
A little extra effort and planning on your part, and a few dollars for the steak and wine. We do this once aa week and the children have come to call it 
'Mommy and Daddy's party night,' which indeed it is."<br>

 their apparel is suddenly decorated with a soft spread, nor do they want to flounder around in the dark for snacks while trying to concentrate on the show. This 
naturally eliminates a number of canapes. They must be of a solid nature to nibble on, or small enough to consumer immediately. A few suggestions which include
 the late evening or midnight snack: Cheese straws, Garlic popcorn, Roast beef snacks, Bologna and cheese snacks, Ham and cheese 'sandwich' snacks, Meat 
balls (Beef in blankets), Dill pickle and cheese snacks, Cheese and deviled ham pinwheels, Ham and Swiss cheese rolls, Pastry pinwheels, Tortilla chips, Veal loaf
 snacks."<br>

<b>New Year's Day festivities</b><br>
"Television has drastically changed New Year's day for millions of Americans. Festive famiy dinners have yielded to bowl broadcasts and TV trays. Open houses have been replaced by 
floats, flowers, and football. Sitting in their rocking chairs, TV viewers traveled from coast to coast and back again thru the magic of the one eyed giant in the 
living room."<br>

<b>TV trays</b><br>
"Truly versitale ore the popular TV trays. While our trays are occaasionally used for the purpose for which they were orginally purchased, namely the serving of meals 
and snacks in front of the television screen, more often they will be found put into service in other ways...The trays always lend an informal atmosphere to evening refreshments an
when friends dorp in. And at buffet suppers, the bane of the males' existence, note the happy smile as each guest is provided with a tray on which to put his dinner...
We oftimes enjoy bedtime snacks, prepared in the kitchen aand carried to the bedroom on a tray. These trays are also ideal for special projects, mending, cutouts, stamp-collecting 
paraphernalia...Even if you don't own a TV set, TV trays are hand to have. They store compactly in a minimum of space and yet when opened can provide ample eating facilities for
a group of people. You can repaint or redecorate them if you wish. Don't confine their use to inside only. During the warm weather, they make happy porch and yard
companions as well."<br>
---"Our TV Trays Unlimited," T. Jewell Collins, <i>Christian Science Monitor</i>, October 11, 1958 (p. 17)
<p>
"When I started this article I intended to write about the many uses we have found in our family for those familiar folding trays on legs, called TV trays, or snack
trays. Our set of four was given to us one Christmas by my husband's parents and they are perhaps the most used and useful furniture in our home. I keep them in the
kitchen, one always set up ready for action next to the rocking chair, and the other three reclining in the holder. I often set my light lunch or breakfast on the 
tray to enjoy a solitary meal of eating and reading. The children can setup up the trays quicker than I can say 'Captain Kangaroo,' when they have permission to eat
a late summer's breakfast or a lunch in front of the TV set. The trays are handy when buffet service for company is the order of the evening...This summer our six-year-old has
become a chef, with the aid of packaged mixes. Since our kitchen counters weren't built for pint-sized cooks, some lower working level had to be found. That's right--the TV trays! There
he can mix, stir, add water and open eggs to his delight...So thanks to TV trays and packaged mixes our by has found an interesting, profitable pastime."<br>

<b>EMERGENCY SHELVES, 2 WAYS, 1950S STYLE</b><br>
Food companies marketed their products to home cooks as convenient/economical/modern ingredients from the middle of
 the 19th century forwards. In the 1950s, this marketing split into two distinct tracts: mom's kitchen & cold war survival.
<p>
<b>1. Mom's kitchen</b><br>
USA housewives embraced the "emergency pantry" stocked with canned foods for economy & expediency from early 
20th century forwards. Recipes incorporatiing commercial products proliferated in the "make do" 1930s & 1940s. They were promoted by
food companies (corporate kitchens) & community cook books. When 
the dean of American cuisine acknowledged the expediency of the Emergency Pantry for <a href="beardpantry.pdf">"Impromptu
 Cooking"</a> in <i>How to Eat Better for Less Money</i>, (1954) American housewives drew a collective sigh of 
validated relief. James Beard offered recipes for Curry in a Hurry, Pizza & Kidney Bean Chili (but not Tuna Noodle Cassrole...
interesting).  Happy to scan/share.
<p>
<b>2. Cold War survival</b><br>
Stocking food in a family's bomb shelter engaged a different set of culinary objectives.

<b>What to serve for a teenage party?</b><br>
If you are going for the classic "Malt Shop" theme (think: Happy Days & Grease) period restaurant (diner, drive in) menus are your best guides. 
Teen party menus suggested in cookbooks are generally not as "hip." Sample 1950s coffee shop & ice cream parlor menus are
online <a href=" http://www.lapl.org/resources/en/menu_collection.html">here</a>.  Type the name of these four restaurants (one at a time) in the "restaurant' box : 
Stan's, Brown Derby, Carnation, Vern's. The database will return entire menus. 
<p>
Based on the menus above, we suggest you serve: hamburgers/cheeseburgers, hot dogs, tuna fish sandwiches, fried chicken, pizza (make your own on 
English muffins or French bread), French fries, potato 
chips, pretzels, corn chips, <a href="foodsauces.html#50sdips">dips & dunks</a>, malted milk, milk shakes, ice cream floats, ice cream sundaes ("make your own" is always a fun activity), cola, root beer, lemonade.
<p>
If you want to recreate a "Drive In" menu, we recommend: <i>The American Drive-In: History and Folklore of the Drive-In
Restaurant in American Car Culture</i>/Michael Karl Witzel and <i>Car Hops and Curb Service: A History of American Drive-In
Restaurants 1920-1950</i> Jim Heimann. Both books are full of pictures (great for decorating ideas) and sample menus. Your
local public librarian will help you obtain these books.

<b>Modern kitchen convenience, 1957</b><br>
"The 1957 housewife can prepare three meals a day for a family of four in one hour and 20 minutes. Her mother spent nearly six hour daily doing 
the same job. These two facts, proven by United States Government tests, represent a modern miracle in the kitchen, probably the biggest let-up 
in kitchen chores since man discovered fire and put woman to work cooking over it. The change didn't happen overnight. It crept up on us during
 the past generation, so smoothly that today's housewife doesn't realize how lucky she is compared to mother. Take chicken soup. Mother made 
her soup with a chicken bought from the butcher and a bunch of soup greens from the vegetable store. Her daughter today just strolls into a 
supermarket, walks past the canned soup shelves and goes home with six different kinds of chicken soup all ready to heat and serve, in less than
 five minutes. Sure, there are still women who make their soup the old way. But the proof of the miracle is your latest cookbook--which starts its
 soup section with the words 'a can of soup.' Precooked foods, frozen foods and modern kitchen equipment have cut the American housewife's
 cooking time so drastically that a record 21 million women can hold jobs and still eat at home--with 10 million of them feeding husbands and 
families besides. A lot of things made possible the miracle in your kitchen: Frozen orange juice, instant cocoa, cookie mixes, 'brown and serve' rolls,
 dehydrated soups in little plastic bags, freezers, blenders, cakes ready to bake in throw-away foil pans, no-rinse detergents, fast oven grease 
removers, pancake batter in paper containers, pre-stuffed turkeys, plastic wrap, ready-made dishes, 'TV dinners.' They've perfected an electronic 
range which bakes potatoes in four minutes flat, and are testing supersonic dishwashers that can scrape egg off a plate in a second, dehydrated
 pork chops that keep a year and 'instant' bread dough powder. Also in the works are automatically irradiated foods that last indefinitely without
 refrigeration, and the 'pouch' diners --whole dehydrated meals in plastic bags that cook instantly when you pour hot water into the bag. Instant 
spaghetti with instant sauce, bread that stays soft three months, canned pre-fried bacon that heat without splatter--these are being made right 
now by the Government. And, by 1959, housewives will have them. The Government agency perfecting these super-convenience foods is the 
Quartermaster Food and Container Institute for the Armed Forces. This vital Government unit has the job of improving military meals--but women
 won it a huge vote of thanks: It put cake mixes, dehydrated soups and boneless meats in your kitchen. It all came about because the QM 
Institute tried to give servicemen in the field in World War II food that was as good as anything they could get in a mess hall...When the war was
 over, powdered eggs, dehydrated potatoes, etc., were grabbed by civilian industry...These solutions became today's convenience foods. 
The one-package meal 'TV' dinner...can claim the K-ration as an ancestor."<br>

<br>
In the United States, the 1960s was a stormy decade shaped by the clash of
conforming tradition and radical change. Culinary wise? WWII rationing was a distant
memory,  50s casseroles were old & boring. The  60s encouraged showy, complicated
food with French influence (Julia Child, Jacqueline Kennedy), suburban devotion
(backyard barbecues),  vegetarian curiosity (Frieda Caplan) and ethnic cuisine (soul
food, Japanese Steak houses). This was also the decade of flaming things (fondue &
Steak Diane) and lots and lots of junk food (aimed at the baby boom children).
"Average" suburban families patronized family-style restaurant chains like Howard
Johnson's. The first Wendy's restaurant opened in 1969.

<b>Buffet, 1960S style</b><br>
Casual entertaining in the 1960s favored theme buffets and barbecue. International themes were
very popular. The foods served were generally not authentic fare but "Americanized" renditions.
Think lasagne with American cheese; Chinese ribs with ketchup.
<p>
<b>1960s buffet notes & menus</b><br><blockquote>
"Buffet food should be notable. For hot buffets, there are many marvelous things to serve as a
change from the good, but too familiar, Boston baked beans and spaghetti with meat sauce.
However, if spaghetti is what you want, serve it in special style, with a brand-new sauce.
<p>
Baked chicken breasts supreme, savory stuffed mushrooms, peach Waldorf salad, hot cheese
biscuits, creme-de-menth parfait, coffee.<p>
Our best cucumbers in sour cream, sirloin tips en brochette, white rice with onions, carrots in
mustard glaze, fresh peas oregano, baba au rhum, tea.

"Women weren't really liberated until the coming of that grand national free-for-all, the cocktail hour. Before Prohibition, bars had
been one-sex affairs. A woman might sneak into the side door of a saloon to have her pitcher filled with lager and then go home to
drink it alone. More respectable matrons would be escorted by gents into the Ladies' Cafe for an occasional ginger beer or port
flip. During Prohibition any girl who dran was, of course, a dangerous piece of sweetmeat...With Repeal...women ripped loose like 
corks bursting in a champagne cellar. Crusty bartenders stood aghast as women, alone or with men, boldly walked into bars, grabbed
pretzels and demanded extra-dry martinis. From busy offices, girls came home not to toll the knell of the parting day but to reach for
the ice bucket. Hotels hastily set up restricted men's bars in defense that new female encroachment, the cocktail lounge...
If you're the garrulous type, don't act as your own bartender...hire a bartender...If you're having a large cocktail party for a
single occasion, you can get you glassware, tables, chairs, etc., by either borrowing or renting them from a regular catering service.
If you give cocktail parties frequently, you should naturally own the necessary equipment for this greatest of twighlight sports.
When the cocktail party is a small informal affair in which four or six friends get together for a few slugs of whisky before
dinner, no major alterations are necessary in your furniture or fixtures....For a crowded come-and-go cocktail party, 
the best plan is to remove all chairs from the room. A no-chair party discourages stragglers and unwanted overnight 
campers. Your cocktail party will then be that rare kind of hour which is confined to sixty minutes.  If, however, you are
expecting the pretzel-benders to stay several hours, you should provide straight-back chairs lined up against the wall with an
 occasional table between chairs lined up against the wall with an occasional table between chairs for ash trays and empty
glasses...The most important equipment at any cocktail party is the glassware. Drinking a martini out of a thin piece of 
crystal and then out of a thick pressed glass makes the same mixture seem like completely different potions...The most popular mixers used in 
highballs include plain water, sparkling (carbonated) water, and some variety of a sweeter elixer like ginger ale. Fussy drinkers will demand a bottled water rather
 than the tap product, especially in those cities where chlorine is used heavily."<br>

"The ever popular cocktail party is an inferior form of entertainment at best, and there is a tendency to make it formal on occasional--something it was never meant 
to be. By all means have your house looking its best, use your best crystal and china, and have the food impeccably turned out, but don't be chi-chi. The results
 may be silly. Unless they are small gatherings around a tray with bottles and ice, cocktail parties should be planned so that the service is efficient a d quick. Don't
 try to set up a professional bar in your house unless you have a barman to go with it, and you will need two if it is a largish party, and more if it is the 'annual crush,'
 which so many people use as a way to pay their social debts (and it is not really a very polite way). A large party will also need someone to tidy up from time to
 time. Some guests love to trail through a party leaving a wake of glasses, napkins and cigarette messes. if you must do with a minimum of help or none at all, serve
 three varieties of drinks--and make good drinks--rather than attempt to offer a selection. The same holds true of cocktail food. Better to have two memorable
 snacks than hundreds of undistiguished canapes. In the menus provided here there is usually one item or two of substantial food. It goes without saying that the 
food should be attractive to look at and tasty as well. While the cocktail party is the most popular way of entertaining it can also be the most difficult, since there is 
so much going on all at once. Don't make your drinks too weak, or your party won't be very lively. Neither make them too generous, or you will have a bunch of 
drunks on your hands. Plan four drinks per person, and have some supplies in reserve. Neither the host nor the hostess should drink unless it is something light. To
 give a good party you must be on the alert, though you appear to be entirely at ease. What a delight if can be to settle down later with your shoes off and have a
 few drinks in peace and quiet." <br>

"Come for Cocktails. Gayest way to entertain lots of friends is the cocktail party. A good cocktail party whould have good drinks, good food, compatible people, and room
enough to circulate a bit. The food should never be sweet, but should certainly be highly seasoned. We favor a 'menu' hearty enough to substitute for a meal, since
cocktail parties often span the dinner hour...Have lots of ashtrays, and put them everywhere. And, if possible, have about twice as many glasses as guests; otherwise, 
you'll be washing glasses during most of the party. Put coasters on every flat surface that could be harmed by moisture. If possible, have separate tables for the drinks and
the food. Try to put the drink table in a place where traffic an move freely to avoid unnecessary spills. Paper napkins, in assorted bright colors, look like 
bouquets if you furl and mass them in little wooden baskets around the room. Wooden picks, used for dipping foods, stick decoratively into pretty fruit arrangements...Topiary
trees made from edibles such as cherry tomatoes, green or ripe olives, marinated shrimp, are decorative additions to the food table, or may be spotted around the 
room. A nice touch is the coffee service later on for your helpers and any stragglers."<br>

<b>Cocktail dinners:</b>"The social pattern is changing just as everything else is these days. Hostesses entertain more frequently, but less formally. Flair replaces fuss; 
invention takes the place of conformity. The choice of food and drink is no longer set and routine. These were some of the opinions aired during the Licensed Beverage
Industries; session at the recent Newspaper Food Editors conference...'Drinking patterns have changed with the growth of the so-called middle class. There's a healthy
trend away from conspicuious consumption of the past, from hard-fisted drinking as a proof of masculinity, from snobbery and reverse snobbery in food and drink
habits.' And what kind of party as this change produced? A  better relationship, socially, between men and women who now enjoy the same kind of drinks together...Cocktails
are a pleasant prelude to shared meals or other social activities instead of an end in themselves.'...Robert Misch talked about the new type of meal that grew out of the 
Age of Aquarius and fits the curretn social scene, the cocktail dinner. Cocktail dinners...are the new trend. They begin with drinks, go on to satisfying food and talk. 
Through planning foresighted hostesses can now be ready to satisfy their guests' dinner-hour appetites with light-hearted ease. They use ready or home-prepared foods that can
be stored in the freezer...Food consultant Sylvia Schur demonstrated the ease of preparing a cocktail dinner. Her version of the classic pot roast will keep warm until slicing
time and is perfect to serve with small sandwich rolls and crisp-cooked vegetables in a gin-marinade. Both meat and vegetables may be prepared ahead of tine...She suggested 
ligh-flavored cocktails for before dinner drinks."<br>

<b>Equipment & service</b><br>
"Now and then we look into the work of our fellow cookbook authors and are usually surprised to discover how little attention they pay to liquor. In past editions we, too, have approached this subject rather apologetically--after all, there was a time when selling or serving alcoholic refreshment was considered disreputable in America. But here and now we drop all subterfuge, frankly concede that 'something to drink' is becoming with us an almost invariable concomitant of at least the company dinner, and have boldly enlarged this section of the book. Always in the back of our minds, spurring us on, is the memory of the cartoon which depicted a group of guests sitting around a living room, strickenly regarding their cocktail glasses, while the hostess, one of those inimitable Hokinson types, all enbonpoint, cheer, and fluttering organdy, announces, 'A very dear friend game me some wonderful old Scotch and I just happened to find a bottle of papaya juice in the refrigerator!'
"Cocktails and Other Before-Dinner Drinks. The cocktail is probably an American invention, and most certainly a typically American kind of drink. Whatever mixtures you put together--and part of the fascination of cocktail making is the degree of inventiveness it seems to encourage--hold fast to a few general principles. * The most important of these is to keep the quantity of the basic ingredients--gin, whisky, rum, etc.--up to about 60% of the total drink, never below half. * Remember, as a corollary, that cocktails are before-meal drinks appetizers. For this reason they should be neither oversweet nor overloaded with cream and egg, in order to avoid spoiling the appetite instead of stimulating it. If you mix drinks in your kitchen, your equipment probably includes the essential strainer, squeezer, bottle opener, ice pick, and sharp knife. Basic bar equiment also includes a heavy glass cocktail shaker; a martini pitcher; and ice bucket and tongs; a bar spoon; a strainer; a jigger; a muddler; a bitters bottle with the dropper type top; and--for converting cubes to crushed ice--a heavy canvas bag and wood mallet. We also show a lemon peeler guaranteed to get only the colored unbitter part of the rind, and the only corkscrew that doesn't induce complete frustration.
"A simple syrup is a useful ingredient when making drinks. Boil for 5 minutes 1 part water to 2 parts sugar, or half as much water as sugar. Keep the syrup in a 
bottle, refrigerated, and use it as needed. In addition to various liquors, it is advisable for the home bartender to have on hand a stock of: bitters, carbonated water,
 lemons, oranges, limes, olives, cherries. For Garnishes see page 40. See also the chapters on Canapes and Hors d'Oeuvre for suitable accompaniments for 
cocktails--besides a steady head...Mix only one round at a time. You stock as a bartender will never go up on the strength of your 'dividend' drinks."<br>

"A Cocktail Party for 30. Here is a party that embodies my approach to the cocktail hour. Instead of tray after tray of tiny morsels of food, we have a good, hearty offering. Serve the usual variety of drinks, but be sure to include some beer, champagne and chilled dry sherry. The steak tartare should be served in a bowl surrounded with a selection of breads and crackers; or molded into a loaf and served on a chopping board. Pass the spareribs with plates and small paper napkins. Along with this, serve either a bowl of freshly shelled peas or fresh, raw asparagus tips--whichever is is season.

I'd set up a full bar and also have some champagne and white wine with cassis. Thus you are apt to satisfy everyone. Coffee is a good idea at about 9 o'clock, with some sweet biscuits, perhaps.

Pate de Campagne, Provencale, Fresh Toast, Anchovied Radishes, Garlic-Flavored Olives."---ibid (p.245)

"A Small Elegant Cocktail Party for 10. This is the type of cocktail party you give for a very close friend who loves the 
elegant things in life or for a visiting mogul who is tremendously important to you or to the community. In other words, 
its a smash! Fill a large silver punch bowl with ice, and in it chill champagne, vodka, and zubrowka and perhaps aqavit.
 If guests demand other drinks, have the makings at hand, but the chilled selection in the punch bowl is appropriate for
 the food to be served. Brink out small plates, knives and forks, and your best linen. Caviar, Smoked Salmon, Foie Gras.
"---ibid (p. 252) 
<p>
"Hors d'oeuvres and canapes are appetizers served with drinks. The canape sits on its own little couch of crouton or pastry tidbit, while the hors d'oeuvere is independently and ready to meet up with whatever bread or cracker is presented separately. Many hors d'oeuvres are themselves rich in fat or are combined with an oil or butter base to buffer the impact of alcohol on the system. If, during preprandial drinking, the appetizer intake is too extensive, any true enjoyment of the meal itself is destroyed. The palate is too heavily coated, too overstimulated by spices and dulled by alcohol. A very hot, light soup is a help in clearing the palate for the more delicate and subtle flavors of the meal. The very name 'hors d'oeuvre,' literally interpreted, means 'outside the main works.' These hold themselves aloof as do the famed Russian Zakuska or the Italian antipasto, in spite of their separatist quality, may even replace the soup course if the portions offered are somewhat more generous in size or amount. Allow about 6 or 8 hors d'oeuvres per person. Serve imaginative combinations, but remember that, unlike in the overture to an opera, it is unwise to forecast in this course any of the joys that are to follow in the meal. Never skip hors d'oeuvres of canapes when you are serving drinks for they play a functional role, but there is not harm in keeping them simple--just olives, salted nuts and one or two interesting spreads or canapes, so the meal that is to follow can be truly relished. Should you serve--either in the living room or at the table--caviar in pickled beets or anchovy eggs on tomatoes, forget the very existence of beet and tomato when planning the flavors of the dinner. This is not a superfluous caution, for one encounters many unnecessarily repetitious meals. Choose for living-room service bite-size canapes or hors d'oeuvres, unless you are furnishing plates. If hors d'oeuvres are meat to be hot, serve them fresh from the oven. If they are the type that will hold, use some form of heated dish. Have cold offerings right out of the refrigerator or on platters set on cracked ice. Cheeses should be presentd at a temperature of around 70 degrees...Here are a a few types of food which are particularly appropriate for the hors d'oeuvre course: Caviar, pate and terrines, vegetables a la grecque, stuffed artichoke hearts, mushrooms, beets, brussel sprouts and cherry tomatoes. You may also use spreads and dips: deviled, pickled, truffled, or chopped eggs; skewered or bacon wrapped tidbits; smoked, sauced or mayonnaised seafood; quenelles, and timbales; choice sausages, both hot and cod; glazed or jellied foods; nuts, olives or cheeses...
"About ways to serve...Food often looks more dramatic if some of it can be presented on several levels...Keep in mind what the platter will look like as it begins to 
be demolished. For this reason, it is often wiser to arrange several small plates which are easily replaced or replenished than one big one which may be difficult to
 resurrect to its pristine glory. First described are some mechanical aids to give platters a lift. Here are a few of the simplest: cut a grapefruit in half or carve a solid 
base on an orange or apple, place cut side down on a plate, stud with hors d'oeuvres, and surround with a garnish or canapes...You may also cut a melon or use a
 small, deep bowl or a footed bowl as a receptacle for hors d'oeuvres and surround it with canapes...Stud a pineapple...Just by the placement of food on the platter 
you can bring about height variations and attractive color relationships. On an oblong plate, center some dainty triangular sandwiches, peaks up like a long mountain
 range. Alternate sandwiches of a fine ham spread or thinly sliced ham with others made of caviar or mushroom spread or with thick buttered bread. Place small, 
well-drained marinated shrimp along the base of the range, on either side, and accent the water cress garnished edge of the platter with French endive or celery 
filled with Guacamole...Try to choose and edible garnish for hors d'oeuvres trays. You may want to try beautifully cut vegetables...If platters are not passed and you
 want a table accent, place hors d'oeuvres directly on crushed ice, on a layered tray..."<br>

"As for food, there is only one guiding principle. Millions of toasties, tidbits, hot and cold hors d'oeuvres, cocktail snacks and canapes are
sold commercially prepared. You simply ask yourself--are they decidedly salty, peppery or piquant? If they are, they spur
the taste and thirst apparatus...For instance, salty anchovy fillets quicken the taste buts. A paste made of canned salmon..deadens
the appetite. Genuine razorback Smithfield ham, cured with pepper, sets the juices flowing. Ordinary boiled ham keeps the
juices passive. If you plan to serve canapes or hors d'oeuvres beforehand, either hot or cold, and you want them to be as showy
as possible, you should buy them already prepared...Be sure to place the prepared canapes on a large platter or tray lined with a
large lace-paper doily...remember to avoid such bland concoctions as peanut butter, tongue puree or cream cheese and pineapple
spread. By all means use such items as Roquefort cheese spread, anchovy paste, smoked salmon paste, etc. Remember that such spreads
 should be ice-cold and should be served on the lightest and crispest crackers or cocktail wafers available...We do not wish to join the
snobcracy who turn up their noses at such old-fashioned teasers as potato chips, peanuts and popcorn. Bit of you're throwing
a party, why not put on a proud belly for your special occasion? Instead of peanuts, serve large, fresh salted almonds; instead of
potato chips serve light, feathery shrimp chips; instead of ordinary popcorn taken from a bag, make your own warm fresh popcorn and 
douse it generously with fresh butter and swirls of salt."<br>
---<i>Playboy Gourmet: a food and drink handbook for the host at home</i>, Thomas Mario [Playboy Press:Chicago IL] 1961 (p. 294-295)
<p>
"The food you serve should be finger-size if possible, as some of your guests will be standing, holding a glass in one hand and eating a bite here and there as they move about
talking to other guests. Juggling doesn't come easily to most people. Circulate fresh supplies as long as part lasts--reguar or open-faced sandwiches, plates of relishes, 
potato chips, salted nuts, and a hot specialty like tiny sausage rolls. Each is best handled separately. Occasionally cocktail-party food is set out as for small buffet, with
a stack of small plates or those who wish them.. Provide plenty of toothpicks or forks for spearing moist snacks. Cocktail food generally is most appealing when sharply flavored--salted
nuts, olives, flavorful crackers, crisp 'munchies,' herring tidbits, smoked oysters, smoked salmon, pates, cheese spreads, dips, spreads, cocktail toast, seasoned toasts, 
nut wafers, cheese wafers, and stuffed eggs. Strips of toasted bread make good appetizer foundations...cut bread into assorted shapes...Or buy small dinner rolls, and slice thin...
For the finishing touch on canapes, here are a few suggestions: anchovy paste asparagus tips and Parmesan cheese on toast strips; onion sandwiches; smoked salmon and capers on 
pumpernickel; caviar with mimosa garnish (sieved egg yolk) on toast; sardines, onions and mayonnaise on toast; shrimp butter and shrimp on toast; ground ham and Swiss 
cheese on rolls, heated; toast, blue-cheese spread and onion garnish; clam cocktail spread on toast triangles decorated with anchovy curls, grilled....Hors d'oeuvres Suggestions:
steak tartare, stuffed mushrooms, turnovers (ham and anchovy, sausage, mushroom or empanadas), shrimp toast, chicken in paper, butterfly shrimp, baked sesame clams, 
keftethes (parsley meat balls), tirotrigona (cheese-filled triangles)."<br>

"Everythwere I go, I find a revolution in American eating--the outdoors has come into the home. A new and exciting style of open-air eating is bringining fresh delights to 
diers on patios and in backyards--or in dining rooms and kitchenettes. Andd they're available in every season of the year. What a phenomenal change! Just twenty years ago when I first
wrote about outdoor cooking, backyard chefs were few. And their usual fare was steak or hamburger, blackened in an inferno of smoke and flame, and a great deal of beer to 
wash away the taste of culinary disaster. Today, in the city no less than the country, we have elevated outdoor cooking to a high art. We still have all the joys of the simplest 
cooking over fire, but we have added the pleasures of true international cookery. Our terraces have become second dining rooms. The kitchen stove is no longer king, but a 
willing partner of the grill rack, the rotisserie spit, and the fireplace. We have mingled a dozen styles of cooking--from the simplest to the most coplez--to produce
superb outdoor menus and meals that may be eaten and enjoyed anywhere. As I travel about these days, I don't find it at all unusual to sit at a table indoors and find myself being 
served a charcoaled duckling that has been spitted over an outdoor grill, and an elaborate, kitchen-prepared rice-and-pine-nut pilaff...Now, in the 1960s, we have an inheritance of good
cooking from all ages of man and a new inclination to apply the imaginatively to a pleasant mode of indoor-outdoor life. And we have all the conveniencdes of modern
civilization to ease our task. Our spits are no longer turned by little boys on treadmills or little dogs, caged in a wheel pursuing a morsel of meat. We have adapted the old 
(and often electrified it) and created the new; dehydrated foods, prepared mixes, portable ice boxes, and vacuum containers...The taste of the outdoor lends a wonderful 
airl of festivity and well-being to a meal. That's why I wrote this book. It's been my aim to enable you to savor this atmosphere fully, wherever you live."<br>

"Cook your meal in foil. Here's a real adventure in eating. The whole meal or each person's meal is packaged, cooked and served in foil. The blend of flavors is absolutely
delicious! Cook these supper 'kits' over the coals on an outdoor grill. Just arrange the foods in their wrappings (hours ahead, if you like) and stow in refrigerator till time to 
cook. Serve packages on paper plates (paper one for no cleanup) and let each hungry diner open his own. Or ou can open all and tuck a sprig of parsley in each for fresh
color. An added plus: If guests are late, dinner will keep warm in foil, not dry out. To go with these easy meals, serve a simple salad or fresh relishes and pickles. Pas a 
basket of hard rolls (heated in foil). For dessert, how about fresh fruit? Mm-mmmm."<br>

<b>Favorite home kitchen appliances, 1966:</b>
<br>
"If you were forced to take inventory of the small electric appliances in your kitchen and select the most helpful, which would
you choose? Home Magazine asked this question of several hundred readers, providing a list of 28 various appliances from which they
could select their favorite. The results are now in and, if you answered 'toaster' to the above, you are in  agreement with the 
majority. Popularity of the toaster disproves, too, the adage that familiarity breeds contempt. For more than 99% of our 
respondents said they owned a toaster; which according to our survey is the appliance most commonly finidng its way into the kitchens
of our homes. Ownerhsip of appliances obviously goes hand in hand with usefulness. The 10 most-owned items were (1) 
toaster, (2)
coffee maker, (3) skillet, (4) waffle maker, (5) can opener, (6) hand mixer, (7) blender, (8) counter-top mixer, (9) knife sharpener,
(10) carving knife. Of these, the six most favored small appliances were as follows: (1) toaster, (2) coffee maker, (3) skillet,
 (4) can opener, (5) counter-top mixer and (6) hand mixer. The next two favorites were the portable broiler oven and the 
electirally powered sauce-pan. Some of the most-owned items failed to make the list of useful favorites. These were considered
nice to have on hand for special uses, but not an every-day helpmate. The waffle maker fits into this category as does the carving
knife. Many of our readers had definate ideas about the usefullness, the drawbacks and the design of small kitchen appliances. Most
agreed, however, that life would be drearier without them."<br>

Sylvia Lovgren's <i>Fashionable Food: Seven Decades of Food Fads</i> [MacMillan:New York]
1995
places these recipes in her 1970s chapter:<br>
zucchini bread, pumpkin bread, crepes, quiche Lorraine, cioppino, spaghetti carbonara, fettucine
alfredo, pasta primavera, moussaka, spinach salad with cheddar cheese dressing, glazed
strawberry pie, granola fondue, carrot cake, strawberry-banana smoothee, broccoli casserole,
wacky cake, apple cake, impossible pie, lemon bars, strawberry squares and tomato coulis.
Note: These recipes were NOT invented in the 1970s. They represent popular choices based on
their presence in period magazines, cookbooks, and menus.

<b>Family meals</b><br>
What "average" people eat in all times and places depends upon who they are (religious/ethnic heritage), where they live
(urban centers? rural outposts?) and how much money they have (wealthy folks have more choices). American chefs in the 1970s  
got to choose between Julia Child (classic French) and Alice Waters (fresh innovation). When New Southwest Cuisine spliced
into the kitchen our American culinary map exploded into delicious fragments of provocative taste.
<p>
Most home cooks did not have this luxury of choice. Economic challenges of the 1970s went beyond the even/odd days at gas 
pumps. They also visited butcher counters in local supermarkets. Horseburgers, anyone? 
<p>
Period cookbooks are imperfect barometers of actual plates served to real people. At best, they accurately report
the collective vision of what average, middle class-people "should be" eating. For that reason they are worth examining.
If you interview anybody who ate their way through the 1970s you are likely to find their meal recollections were pretty different from
the following recommendations. People eat what's in the house. If the primary cook has time to cook traditional 
time-consuming recipes then so dines the rest of these house. Note: most folks through the ages valued food economy & prep 
time.

Semi-formal dinner? Most libraries still have a copy the 1975 edition of Irma Rombauer's <i>Joy
of Cooking</i>. This is an excellent source for authentic (albeit generic) menus and recipes. If
you want to try something more "popular" this source is excellent. If you prefer <a

<b>Cook-at-table Dinners</b><br>
Cook-at-table dinners are a delightful combination of the exotic, the sophisticated and the intimate. There's something
particularly appealing about the sight of a flame flickering under a bubbling fondue pot or a handsome chafing dish. And 
these dinners are surefire icebreakers. Guests love the do-it-yourself aspects, the fun of cooking their own meat or dunking
bread into hot, creamy cheese. And from the point of view of the hostess, there are highly practical advantages to 
presenting a meal that can be prepared almost entirely in advance. Not to mention the joy of a main dish that keeps the
hostess out of the kitchen and free to socialize. One kind of cook-and-eat meal is cheese fondue. This is a pot of melted
cheese combined with wine. Guests swirl cubes of bread (or ham or cherry tomatoes) in the rich mixture. Though it's fun to do all the 
cooking at the table, it ma be easier to do the preliminary cooking in the kitchen and then transfer the cheese mixture to a chafing
dish or fondue pot for the final heating and serving. Then there's beef fondue: Pieces of raw meat are cooked one at a
time in a container of very hot oil, then dipped into an array of sauces and savories. A third kind of table-cooked diinner is Oriental
in origin. This offers a wide variety of combinations of meat or seafood and vegetables simmered in a seasoned broth. Since these
dinners are usually a bit foreign in flavor, they suggest all manner of appropropriate table decorations. The cooking pot can
often double as a centerpiece. Escargots and beef fondue can be somewhat French if the tablecloth is the traditional red-and-white
check of a Montmartre cafe and fat red candles are in the background. Or as part of the sukiyaki setting, use a glass
bowl with two or three gardenias or anemones afloat or an arrangmeent of small figurines. Do keep in mind that cook-it-yoruself dishes
call for a little extra elbow room. Don't crowd the table. And be sure, especially with fondues, that both the pot and the 
dips are within easy reach of everyone. You might take the precaution of using an easly laundered or wipe-off cloth. Then if a 
few splatters occcur, no one is embarrassed...remember that this kind of dinner is not meant to be eaten in a hurry--the self-
service takes time, and the cooking itself is a major part of the evening's entertainment."<br>

<b>Popular drinks and cocktail trends: </b><br>
"The Bar: What you keep on hand depends on many variables: whether you and your friends enjoy cocktails and wine or prefer beer, soft drinks;
 how much space you have for your 'cellar'; how much money you feel like investing. Stocking a bar can be an expensive hobby! We can't really 
tell you whether you should buy premium liquor or the 'house brand' at your liquor store, because you and your friends are not like anybody else so 
far as taste is concerned. Some people recognize, appreciate, and insist on the best quality. Others don't know or care! Some, unfortunately,
 can't tell the difference in taste but are impressed by labels. (The latter order name-brands in a bar, frequently to sound sophisticated, but
 probably wouldn't really notice if somebody switched brands on them.) However, bar stocking isn't a contest. You want to please guests, whether
 they are connoisseurs or novices in the matter of wine and liquor and so you'll steer a middle course. Select a good liquor store where the range
 of wine indicates knowledge and taste. It's usually best to buy a good California wine rather than an unknown French or German one from the 
bargain bin. Do ask the sales clerk for advice: He'll probably be flattered and eager to help. If he tries to sell you a vintage Burgundy to go with 
pizza, avanti to another store! Basic liquor requirements to make the drinks listed in our menus are: <br>
<b>1. Spirits:</b> Derry gin, domestic or imported (English), Scotch whiskey, vodka, blended or bourbon whiskey, rum (Puerto Rican or Virgin 
Island), brandy (codnac, armagnac, or domestic) <br>
<b>2. Aperitif wines and drink ingredients:</b> Sherry, ginger wine (Stone's or Crabbie's or Whiskey Mac), vermouth, French (dry), Vermouth, 
Italian (sweet), vermouth, flavored (e.g. Dubonnet, Positano, Csarpano, Chambery, etc.) <br>
<b>3. Assorted flavorings:</b> Grenadine, Rose's lime juice, Angostura bitters, orange bitters, orange flower water <br>
<b>4. Liqueurs:</b> There are dozens of these, and selection is a matter for individual preference and money. The following are among the most
 popular, and may be used not only as after-dinner drinks, but sprinkled over ice cream or fresh fruit, as an ingredient in certain cocktails. 
Cointreau, Grand Marnier, Drambuie, Cassis, Triple Sec, Creme de menthe, Kahlua, Creme de cacao, Kirsch. 
These are also sometimes offered as after-dinner drinks: brandy, port, Marsala, and Madiera.<br>
<b>5. Soft drinks and mixers:</b> Club soda, ginger ale, tonic (quinine water), Coca-Cola, 7-Up, or other favorites, low-calorie mixers if 
desired." <br>

"The public taste is swinging away from the ultra-dry, palate-numbing drinks to cocktails with more emphatic flavors. Favorite drinks still may vary 
with the region. But a House Beautiful survey of bars in well-known clubs and restaurants around the country indicates that more-tasty cocktails 
are being ordered everywhere. These professional barmen credit the new drink preferences to the influence of women, who often don't like 
astringent cocktails, and of young people, who create their own drinks in a freehand style that ignores the time-honored rituals of mixology. There 
has been much talk of late that young people of today do not drink as much as their counterparts of a few years ago. But several industry 
surveys have reported that the younger generation's consumption now is at about the same level as that of those who came before. Today's 
young drinkers are, however, drinking more types of cocktails with a greater variety of spirits mixed into them. Typical of the new drink innovators 
are California's young surfers. They pioneered the kooky Harvey Wallbanger, a current favorite. Named for a fictitious folk hero of Paul Bunyan's 
stripe, Harvey packs an alcoholic A-bomb behind its beguiling taste. It combines three to six ounces of orange juice and one ounce of vodka 
with 1/2 ounce of Galliano floated on the top. Another youth-invented potion is a mixture of brandy and Kahlua...For experimentation, a number of 
brandies and liquors come in miniature (one- to 1 1/2-oz.) bottles. At 50 cents to $1.50 each, they allow tryouts for the new drinks without
 having to stock a large inventory. Miniatures, however, are not for sale in all 50 states. New premixed cocktails recently launched by two industry 
giants (National Distillers and Seagram) allow a host or hostess to serve some of the most exotic and hard-to-make drinks in town without messy 
bartending. Pop the top of an eight-ounce aluminum can (two drinks), and out pour the subtle flavorings of Mai Tai, for example, a mix of white 
rum, Orgeat (brandy, almonds and orange water), Curacao and fresh lime juice. Also featured among these convenience cans (a special boon to 
women, who like the seductive cocktails and who do most of the home liquor-buying) are dinks with ingredients the home bar is not apt to have 
and can't stock from local liquor stores and fruit stands. Pina Colada, Apricot Sour, Margarita, classic and fruit-flavored Daiquiris are just the 
beginning of more exotic drinks to come. The time-honored, safe way to sample a new dink is to try out a professional version at a bar before 
stocking the sometimes exotic ingredients a recipe may call for." <br>

<b>Hors d'oeuvres & small bites</b><br>
"Having people in for drinks calls for a menu different from one for brunch or dinner. You may ask one or two friends to stop by after work, or give a real cocktail party for twenty or more people. In either case, you need nibble food to accompany the wine or liquor. Two rules: one, it should be possible to eat the nibbles with your fingers whether you're standing up or served on the arm of a chair, without any great danger to messy spills on clothes, rugs, or furniture. Two, such food shouldn't need hours of preparations. Too-elaborate canapes may look bery pretty, but they are a lot of work, and a small kitchen is not the ideal place to make them. Also, most canape leftovers are absolutely useless; you just have to throw them away...Here are some ideas and recipes for cocktail party food, grouped into four menus with different national accents, all meeting the two preceding requirements. For fewer guests, select just two or three items from one of the menus, or one from each if you prefer. Keep some of the staples on hand, especially if you adore giving impromptu invitations. We suggest: corn chips, melba toast rounds, miniature sesame crakers, pastry shells, cocktail crackers shaped to hold a filling.

<b>Cocktail Parties, 1980s style</b><br>
By the 1980s, formal cocktail parties were a thing of the past. What one's parents' did. Wine & cheese parties and informal gatherings took their place.
 The younger generation was calorie-conscious, replacing canapes and caviar with raw vegetables and light dips. They also offered non-alcoholic
options in the form of "mocktails." The return of the formal cocktail party is generally credited to the Yuppies, young upwardly-mobile professionals of the
mid-1980s. The food and drinks were updated to reflect the times. It took a while for new hosts to realize the wisdom of the canape and all those alcohol-soaking
carbs. 

<p>
<b>[1981]</b><br>
"Cocktails! party invitations read...I had no idea whether cocktail parties were going on around me in Michigan; my only knowledge of them came from those Myrna Loy/
William Powell movies  'Let's have a cocktail!' one would say, striking an instant note of gaiety, and at once the mirrored walls, glass tables, flower vases and
 triangular crystal ashtrays sparkled in response. A merry to-do was made over the mixing, the stirring, the straining, the pouring; a great deal of badinage over the
dryness of the martini. A settling of satin sofa pillows, tinkling glasses, selecting of cigarets and an exciting interplay of smiles and meaningful looks indicated
that cocktails were the elixir of joy...No, by the time age allowed me to have cocktails, the age of cocktails was gone...You didn't meet for cocktails anymore;
you had a drink before dinner. Glass in hand, you did not sit and laugh and engage in banter and sip again--no, three quick gulps and you were through; hurry up or
we'll miss our dinner reservation. They don't have cocktail hours anymore, they have happy hours, which refer not at all to the merriment of the company but only to
the price of the drinks. Since those childhood memories I haven't seen a straight cocktail party invitation' they're all no-host bars, which means the drinks are
on you...The purpose is no longer 'jollity'...but to make money--a fundraiser, a poitical mixer, a campaign coffer fattener...Instead of a cocktail party why don't 
they simply call it a Money Raiser With Cocktails If You Want To Buy Them? And even these are fast giving way to wine and cheese parties...Now it's 'Red or white?' and 
that's it...Gloop--there she goes in your glass--or worse, plastic."<br>
---"Things as seen: it's cocktail time," Miv Schaaf, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, March 22, 1981 (p. O30)
<p>
<b>[1982]</b><br>
"The most highly caloric event in history was not the wedding of some medieval king, but the marriage of the cocktail with the snack. Never before or since have
so many different foods been invited to a single table. Ordinary culinary boundaries are ignored and routine dietary considerations forgotten in celebration of the
cocktail hour. The definition of cocktail food...is anything that tastes good with strong drink...Cocktail food can be eaten with a fork or fingers, or sipped in hot 
bouillon with a shot of whiskey (in which the cocktail becomes part of the food). It can be dipped, spread or speared. It can be sandwiches-open, closed, stacked or
rolled It can be elaborate doughs filled and formed into cunning shapes, from Chinese steamed dumplings to Argentine baked empanadas. The only requirement for 
cocktail food is that it must be possible to eat it in very small portions--and endlessly, without noticing that you are actually eating. In other words, cocktail
food is expected to be silent calories which, unlike whipped cream cakes that scream their extravagance, slide down with just a little crunch or piquancy that 
couldn't possibly spoil one's appetite or wreck one's diet..."<br>

"In recent years the Bloody Mary has emerged as one of the most popular cocktails in America. If you ask Lee Taylor, he'll tell you that his company is largely
resposible for that Taylor Food Products Inc., operating out of a 5,000-square-foot factory in Compton, markets Mr and Mrs 'T', a tomato-based liquid which when
added to vodka produces the spicy taste that Bloody Mary afficianados savor. The concoction, first developed by Taylor's father and mother (Mr. and Mrs. T), has 
caused the firm to grow in just over 20 years from a small family business to a $20-million-a year enterprise. This year, Taylor expects to ship a million and a 
half cases of Bloody Mary mix nationwide and overseas...Taylor said several surveys rank the Bloody Mary as the nation's most popular mixed drink...The Bloody
Mary used to be considered to be something one drank the morning after drinking too much...a hangover treatment. 'We took it out of the hangover category and turned
it into a legitmate drink,' Taylor said...It was in 1960 that the elder Taylor got the idea for a Bloody Mary Mix. There was no such thing at the time--people used
V-8 or tomato juice, which couldn't impart the full-bodied range of tastes that he thought this drink demanded. So Taylor developed a formula, which the company
still uses and guards jealously...The first major account for the mix was Host International
which operates restaurants and bars at Los Angleles International Airport. The first big break came when an American Airlines executive had a Bloody Mary at an
Airport bar and liked it so much he ordered Taylor's mix to be served on American's flights."<br>

"The food chosen to be festive and fresh...with a few hot zippy dishes, like the beef satay and curried lamb added for their distinct flavors...The Black Forest canapes,
...in which Brie, a slice of pink ham and a sprig of good black bread...The crudites...are built up on a bed of crushed ice and a field of broccoli and cauliflower...
The menu also included angels on horseback (oysters wrapped in bacon), fried wontons, fillet of beef on bernaise-butter toast, crabmeat in snow-pea pods and lemon 
shrimp...And this is not meant to be a dinner substitute, although some people may be satisfied enough to consider it such...estimate between 10 and 15 hors 
d'oeuvres per person, with 10 or 11 choices. Variety is fun."<br>

"Cocktails at seven. Perhaps no other social phrase sounds so stylish, so grown-up and, uttered from the right lips, so downright seductive. After having 
virtually evaporated in the laid-back '70s, cocktail parties are just a swizle stick a way from being hot again. The sound of the cocktail shaker again is being
heard in the land. The '80s twist to the cocktail party is that young, upwardy mobile professionals, fondly known as Yuppies, are now holding the cocktail shakers. These
babyboomers-turned-trend-eaters are reclaiming the cocktail party from its social exile among the young by adding it to their repertoire of Yuppie-isms, which includes 
such neo-conservative items as black tie, good manners and anything that smacks of quality or making it. Immortalized in the cafe society days by Noel Coward, pilloried
in its suburban dreariness by John Cheever and perceived by the younger set as a decadent, elitist Estabishment throwback in the '60s and '70s, the cocktail party
even fizzled a bit among their elders, particularly during the no-frills Carter years, a period notably bereft of smart Washington soirees. Some credit Nancy
Reagan with reviving the cocktail party and restoring it, along with glitter and glamor...'[Cocktail parties] existed 10 years ago, but I think we all looked
at them as being stodgy, stiff and artificial. It's almost like the club we were ever let into, and now that we're in and realize that they don't have to be that way.'...
Helen Gurley Brown, editor of Cosmopolitan...[said] 'I never go to one...Cocktail parties...in my opinion, range all the way from tedious to gruesome...'
Rene Peyrat, food and beverage director at the chic Carlyle Hotel, says, 'Champagne as come to be very, very fashionable.' As an aperitif, he says, favorites include
Kir Royale, champagne with a touch of cassis. Over at the Waldorf-Astoria's Bull and Bear Bar, where corporate executives go for cocktails, light-colored drinks,
especially vodka-based, are the vogue...In Chicago, whiskey sours are passee and pink ladies are dead, but strawberry daquiris and margaritas and coming on strong
and the martini and Manhattan are hanging in there. Oceans of white wine are still being poured at cocktail time all over the country, but the tide, some say, is
beginning to turn...The new cocktail party is not about liquor; it's about people..."<br>
---"Return of the Cocktail Party," Lisa Anderson, <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, October 3, 1984 (p. E3)

<b>[1985]</b><br>
"Festive specialty drinks for the holidays, where ...traditionally alcoholic and loaded with calories, can be a  dangerzone for waist-watchers as well as for persons
who might be restricting their alcohol intake. Whether you call them mocktails, un-cocktails or just plain coolers, non-alcoholic drinks are the perfect choice for people
who are cutting down on alcohol and sweets for health and fitness reasons and an especially wise choice for those who simply don't want to drink and drive...Liven up
the presentation of these taste-tempting alternatives by serving them in elegant crystal stemware...Fruit juice is a wonderful taste companions for club soda, ginger
ale and cream..."<br>

"For informal entertaining there's just no simpler way to go than the cocktail party. With some careful planning and plenty of manageable finger foods, the host
or hostess is almost assured a success. The warm weather days of of summer make early evening gatherings of friends and family especially convival...Invitations to a 
cocktail party are usually written and sent out to to three weeks in advance. The usual hours for cocktails are between 5 or 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.. Guests may come and
go as they please. Plan to serve one or two different kinds of mixed drinks and an assortment of hard liquors with mixes. Wine and beer as well as non-alcoholic
beverages, should be served. If space permits, set up miniature bars in different rooms so guests can prepare their own drinks. If you do not have the space,
pre-mix the drinks and pass them around on trays with cocktail napkins or reserve pitchers of pre-mixed drinks so guests can help themselves. Because people will 
probably be standing and mingling, make sure the food is easy to eat with fingers. Cocktail foods can be hot, cold or both. Cheese platters and crudites or raw
vegetables cut for dipping are suitable, as well as the quintessential cocktail food: canapes or other hor d'oeuvres. Hor d'oeuvre trays can be passed around or set up
in convenient areas of the room. Be sure to provide ample napkins and wood picks and arrange small bowls throughout the house."<br>

"Cocktail parties! My parents...painfully undertook the ritual once a year. Edibles were sparse...but drinks, under my father's direction, were generous. After a while
the noise level would rise agreeably so the gathering could be voted a success. Thank goodness entertaining today is less formal, with invitations on the phone. This
is emphatically the moment to do your own thing, not emulate a catering service. Cocktails at home should be homey, the food based on local, seasonal ingredients. 
The drinks should be yoour favorite wines, perhaps a fruit punch, or a choice of hard liquor...The Menu: Smoked Salmon and Caviar Checkerboard, Ham and Turkey
Checkerboard, Crudites and Red Hot Chili Mayonnaise, Goat Cheese and Hazelnut Dip, Cheese Palm Leaves, Anchovy Cartwheels. Drinks: your choice of liquor, wines, 
fruit juices and sodas."<br>

<p>
<b>[1987]</b><br>
"What to serve at a large cocktail party? Spring vegetables are the answer at this time of year. Crudities--raw or blanched vegetables--are hardly new but they are
always popular, especially with the host or hostess who does not have to worry about taking sizzling trays out of the oven during the evening, or spending hours
beforehand making complicated little things with puff pastry. Recently I served a heapig selection of asparagus spears (blanched), red and yellow pepper florets,
carrot sticks, cherry tomatoes cut in thin slices. Baby vegetables such as zucchini...and other squash are also good, lightly blanched and served whole. Red cabbage 
or kale make an attractive base for the display. I like to serve a choice of oil-based dips such as pinzimonoil, an Italian dip made with extra-virgin olive oil 
lemon and coarse salt, or a Chinese dip made with strong sesame oil mixed with sesame paste. Garlic is excellent in the latter. When I lived in Mexico I learned
to make guacamole with fresh chilies, chopped up coarsely so that the sauce was chunky instead of smooth. It has a delicious flavor and is equally good with tortilla
chips or crudites. A mixture of sun-dried and fresh tomatoes blended together is superb on crackers or as a dip, and goes really well with a little fresh ricotta 
cheese on top."<br>
---"Raw or Blanched Vegetables, Cocktails for 70," Moira Hodgson, <i>New York Times</i>, May 17, 1987 (p. 851)<br>
[NOTE: This article offer recipes for Guacamole, Tomato Spread with Ricotta Cheese, Sesame Dip & Sesame-Dijon Dip.]
<p>
"It's fashionable for people to bemoan cocktail parties. They're so noisy. They can be smoky. And you're expected to stand around for hours balancing a drink
in one hand and a nibble in the other. And too often, the food is lousy--cocktail treats on wood picks, bowls of salted peanuts grayish chicken livers wrapped in bacon 
and cold mini--quiches...But cocktail parties needn't be grim affairs for either the hostess-who may be overwhelmed by the thought of wine stains on her carpet--
or for the guests who can think of a million other places they'd rather be for two hours on a Friday night. They can be fun if they're well planned. Here are a few
tips:--Organize a guest list well in advance. Make sure there will be an interesting mix of people and age groups. Avoid all-office parties like the plague. They tend
to be very boring for spouses. Make sure every person invited knows at least two other people. That was, nobody will feel like a wallflower.--Ordering alcoholic 
beverages depends a lot on the age of the guests. Those older than 50 tend to prefer hard liquor; younger people drink wine. Don't serve red wine at a cocktail
party. You're just asking for a stained carpet or couch.--Never underestimate the importance of food at a cocktail party. Such parties are always held around 6 p.m.,
when people are starving. You don't want guests drinking on an empty stomach and leaving drunk. So give them lots of food and make it good. And keep in mind that
many friendships have been made beside the warmed brie and many deals have been struck over the steak tartare.--Don't be afraid to hire a teenage baby sitter to help
with kitchen chores and passing hors d'oeuvres. It's good experience...But make arrangements well in advance. If you've invited lots of neighbors, baby sitters will
be in short supply."<br>
---"Cocktail Parties Should be Planned in Advance," Kathleen Walker, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, December 10, 1987 (p. V-A37)

<b>[1989]</b><br>
"The celebration of the new year is more often toasted  with a glass of good cheer--or two or three or more--at that lively American institution, the cocktail party.
It is well known that you are better off eating something while you drink. That's why hors d'ourvres were invented. But for the quantity of booze consumed waiting
to welcome on the New Year, chips and dips, peanuts and pretzels and platters of cute little cut up vegetables don't cut it. You need something more substantial. You
need carbohydrates and plenty of protein. Rillettes--or potted meats as the English call them--are cooked meat, poultry or fish that have been pounded or 
shredded into fibers, mixed with lard or butter, then preserved in little stoneware, porcelain or glass crocks..."<br>

<b>Tall food</b><br>

The "tall food" movement began in the early 1990s as an counterbalance to 1980s nouvelle cuisine. Our research indicates chef Alfred Portale, Gotham Bar & Grill
 (NYC) introduced this cuisine. 
<p>
The concept of stacking foods is not entirely new. Antonin Careme (19th century French pastry chef) was by trade an architect. His sugarwork and pastry creations
 were elaborate and large. Colonial era iced (sugar coated) fruit pyramids were popular holiday centerpieces. Victorian-era multi-tiered wedding cakes were visual
 focal points. Of course, these "tall foods" were not served to individual diners. They were cut and served by waitstaff. The ultimate tall food afficianado was Dagwood
Bumstead, whose <a href="foodsandwiches.html#dagwood">tall sandwiches</a> have become American icons. Triple decker <a href="foodsandwiches.html#club">
Club sandwiches</a> have been popular since the 1920s.
<p>
"When Gotham Bar and Grill opened in the early 1980's, it epitomized the high-living, brash-spending decade. The warehouse space on East 
12th Street was an eclectic meld of new-wave Americana and Italian moderne...The dishes soar in height as well as flavor. Gotham Bar and Grill is the 
home of tall food. The salads look like mountain ranges. The delectable sauteed soft-shelled crabs are perched high on pillars of 
grilled yellow and green squash that flank a pyramid of couscous and tasty baby bock choy. The roast chicken is excellent, but it is 
served with such a towering haystack of fried matchstick potatoes that the diner's initial response is to call for a pitchfork and 
start making bales. Inevitably, the soaring constructions collapse and the diner becomes the clean-up crew." <br>
---"Restaurants:: A survivor from the high-living of the 80's and some reasons for its survival in the 90's," 
Molly O'Neill, <i>New York Times</i>, August 27, 1993 (p. C24) 
 <p>
"After years of serving up famine-sized portions known as nouvelle cuisine, chefs have taken a U-turn. Boasting about their 'architectural presentation' and 
comparing one another's 'dish verticality,' chefs in some cases are building dishes that rise more than 14 inches off the table...At New York's Gotham Bar & Grill, 
considered by many to be the birthplace of tall food, chefs arrange asparagus spears in square latticework formations that look like lincoln Logs. The chicken 
breast, which is topped with a 12-inch tower of shoestring potatoes, is daunting to diner[s]...What's up with the stratospheric cuisine? For chefs, especially the 
young Turks of the culinary world, the gravity-defying kitchen feats are a way of getting notice and heightening the sensation for diners. As chefs point out, people 
eat first with their eyes. Some have another reason as well. 'It allows me to charge a little bit more,' says Roger Kaplan, City Grill's executive chef. 'people see that 
something more went into it.' His Towering Tuna appetizer is on the menu at $9. No dish is too lowly to be built up. Salads, pastas, vegetables, meats, desserts--all 
can be stacked high if the kitchen uses the right tools. At Mrs. Park's Tavern, Mr. Ubert shows off an order of onion rings served on the handle of a miniature 
butter churn. Across the country, broccoli , which used to be served in tiny flowerets, now assail you vertically, flowers down, with the stalks toward the heavens. 
Shards of lettuce are stuck into food like a sign in the front yard. Potatoes, whose gluey starches make them a snap to build tall, are a big favorite among chefs in 
this construction business. Chicago Tribune food critic Phil Vettel likes tall food. 'It's a statement. It's not easy to do, and it brings out the 'ooohs ' and 'aaahs,'' he 
says. 'As a customer, you just sit there and think about the engineering. You say, 'How did they do that?''..But some food critics are already tiring of the trend. They 
say the lengths to which chefs will go are getting ridiculous...At some restaurants, the teetering meals sometimes fall apart on the way to the table, annoying the 
waiters and forcing chefs to 'replate' them or prop them up...Alfred Portale, chef of the Gotham Bar & Grill, agrees that the trend is out of hand...At least one 
etiquette expert condemns tall food as an unfair attempt by chefs to make dining awkward. 'The true chef thinks about the enjoyment and ease of eating,' says Letitia 
Baldridge in her 'New Complete Guide to Executive Manners.' When you are accosted by tall food, Mrs. Baldridge recommends that you hold the top of it with 
your hand and knock it over with a spoon. 'You have every right to use your fingers if it keeps your clothes from being ruined,' she says. But tall food seems here to 
stay. And everybody is doing it, from fast-foodplaces to airlines. McDonalds recently featured a Super Hero sandwich, a three-layered monster stuffed with slabs 
of beef. Burger King claims its Whopper sandwich now stands 2 5/8 inches high, thanks to the company's 'Bigger, Better Burger' campaign. For its 'Connoisseur' 
business-class service, United Airlines now teaches flight attendants to stack asparagus teepee-style and, this summer, briefly served a pasta casserole so high that 
the lids of the dinner trays popped off when flight attendants pulled them out of the oven. Then too, some foods have always been tall. The three-decker club 
sandwich is a classic, as is the ice-cream sundae. The Carnegie Deli in New York has always served sandwiches impossible to get your mouth around. Morton's 
of Chicago has long offered a filet mignon the size of a Rubik's Cube. Dagwood Bumstead, perhaps the original tall food fan, was way ahead of his time. He built 
his first Dagwood Sandwich back in 1936--a concoction of tongue, sardines and beans, slathered with onion and horseradish." <br>
---"Restaurant Food, Taller and Taller, Reaches for the Stars," Carl Quintanilla, <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, September 22, 1995 (p. A1) 
 <p>
"Meal after meal, Alfred Portale reinvents himself. Turn on the stove, and this diminutive, fastidious, self-effacing chef is suddenly King Kong. He cooks tall, mountainous food that's 
irrepressibly bold. Nearly every plate that leaves his kitchen at Gotham Bar and Grill is a composition in perilous peaks. Consider the tower of wafer-thin potatoes, truffles and 
sea scallops wobbling on a pong of herb butter sauce. Or the pillar of roasted vegetables, trembling with anticipation. A haystack of needle-thin fries is heaped around a perfectly roasted 
chicken. It's almost as precarious as the quivering flan flanking a pyramid of lamb chops. This food is a felicitous for the dry cleaner as it is for the gourmand--food that collapses at the 
whisper of a fork. It is as if the 39-year-old chef must continually remind his Greenwich Village patrons that their best-laid plans are fragile indeed, vulnerable, at every turn, 
to human appetite. But even more appealing than the flavor and generosity of Portale's cooking is the way it tempts instinct and memory. For after the towers of scallops 
have crumbled, the fries have scattered and the vegetable pillar collapsed, one doesn't face ruin, exactly, but a heap of inchoate possibility...Portale himself professes to have no subtext 
when he cooks. He says only that his ingredients are American, his technique French. The dizzying effects he achieves are left for others to rhapsodize." <br>
---"An Edible Complex: The diminutive Alfred Portale has a talent for making a mountain out of a morel," Molly O'Neill, <i>New York Times</i>, March 12, 1995 (p. SM89) 
 <p>
"Tall food isn't about to topple over, but some chefs wish they could cut it down to size. Take Christopher Gross' chocolate tower, a dessert the Phoenix-based chef created 
13 years ago...Even if he wanted to take it off the menu, he couldn't. The dessert, a cylinder of chocolate mousse about 5 inches tall, represents about 25 percent of dessert sales 
at his 140-seat restaurant...Alfred Portale of Gotham Bar & Grill in New York, viewed by some as the architect of the tall-food craze, doesn't even want to talk about it 
anymore. 'He doesn't want to be seen as doing it for the sake of doing it,' says a spokesman for Portale...'The reason he does it goes beyond presentation...It's far from the fast thing 
he does. Taste is first.' In the nouvelle '80s, food tended to be fanned out flat on the plate. Then chefs like Portale started building up their food, from salads to desserts, to the 
point where New York magazine recently took out a measuring stick to actually see which chef could build the highest creation. While taste risks being lost to such architectural 
antics, several chefs say tall presentations are more than a flash in the pan. Adding height and structure to a plate creates visual excitement and also allows for a 
layering of tastes and textures...When food is laid out flat on a plate, customers have to put it together themselves...'The way [Norman Van Aken] design I want the flavors to 
become integrated by the intrusion of the fork and the knife.'...However, tall food does have a pitfall 'The dish has been handled too much...It's not going to be so a la minute as 
it should be.'...And customers enjoy tall food. 'There's always a bit of apprehension about how to disassemble it and how to attack it. That's part of the fun...Architecture 
belongs on the plate...as long as the emphasis is on taste as well. 'There are pastry chefs who possibly hide behind their architectural design because they don't know how to 
produce flavor.'" <br>
---"Tall Food: A Tall Order," Louise Kramer, <i>Nation's Restaurant News</i>, January 15, 1996 (p. 29) 
 <p>
"Tall food now comes with a warning. Instead of surprising the customer with an architectural appetizer, salad or dessert, chefs are describing their fantastic structures 
on the menu. Is this a good thing? Perhaps. The diner who is not in the mood to tear down chocolate scaffolding or to destroy elaborate vegetable pyramids can opt for another 
dish. But by revealing the form as well as the ingredients in advance,some of the 'wow' may be subverted. Nonetheless, detailed descriptions are becoming the rule, not the 
exception, as plates of fancy constructions parade form kitchen to dining room across the country."<br> 
---"Chefs Build on Architectural Aesthetic As Structures Rise on Plates Nationwide," Florence Fabricant, <i>Nation's Restaurant News</i>, May 10, 1999 (p. 64)

The 21st century is a time of culinary irony. We celebrate product diversity while chowing comfort 
foods. We choose miniature products then consume more of them so they cancel each other out. We are told farmed salmon
is sustainable but the fish is flavorless and injected with artificial dye. We carry our reusable bags to the supermarkets and fill them with
overpackaged commercial products. We treasure our beloved cookooks but Google recipes on the fly. We worry about feeding our unemployed neighbors while we 
throw away our supersized leftovers. 
We let <i>Gourmet</i> die then resurrect it <a href="http://www.gourmet.com">online</a>. We demand culinary innovation and embrace 
<a href="index.html">food history</a>. 
<p>
No wonder food professionals are having a hard time giving us what we want! The good news is...American consumers
have more choices than ever before. Chain supermarkets partner with local farmers, savvy companies promote vintage 
lines, independent ice cream mixologists dabble with exotic flavors. Only now can we have Italian style panko, ancient grain sliced packaged bread, 
and acceptable (finally!) hot house tomatoes. What's in your basket?

<b>New product introductions</b><br>
The following list was culled from articles published in several magazines, newspapers and trade journals uploaded to ProQuest Research II database. We 
compressed them and bolded the product names to facilitate research. This is by no means a comprehensive list. 
<p>
<b>[2000]</b><br>
"<b>When Heinz launched StarKist Tuna in a pouch</b> in October 2000, it was billed as the biggest breakthrough in 50 years in a segment that has been 
struggling with an all-time low in tuna prices. Other marketers soon followed: ConAgra Foods' Bumble Bee bowed pouched tunas and 
<b>Chicken-of-the-Sea launched Tuna Salad Kits. </b>
But never has anyone attempted so profound a reinvention as the one introduced in supermarkets nationwide in August by <b>Pillsbury Co</b>., of Minneapolis: 
the <b>rectangular bagel</b>. Pillsbury is calling the thing the <b>Toaster Bagel Shoppe</b>, although it certainly isn't a shoppe and, in fact, may not even qualify as a bagel. It is
 a frozen piece of dough, smooth on the outside, with cream cheese and jelly stuffed inside.
<b>Kellogg Co.'s</b> latest attempt to transform existing brands into portable breakfasts is a line of filled Eggo waffles dubbed <b>Waf-Fulls</b>. The three-variety line, 
which uses strawberry, maple and applecinnamon fillings, will launch in September backed by a $20 million marketing effort beginning in November.
<b>General Mills</b> this fall launches two new products that tap into health and convenience trends: a nutritious cereal targeted to women and a new brand of cereal 
bars. <b>Harmony, a vanilla almond oat cereal</b> fortified with calcium, antioxidants, soy protein, folic acid and iron, begins shipping to retailers ...At the same time, 
General Mills will launch a line of <b>Milk 'n Cereal bars</b> that uses milk as a key ingredient in bars made with three of its top cereal brands-Honey Nut Cheerios, 
Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Chex-to offer a bowl of cereal in a more portable form. 
Cookies don't crumble at biscuit dynamo <b>Nabisco Foods</b>--they just come in different sizes. Bite-size items have proliferated in the food industry, and a 
<b>mini-version of its Oreo</b> should hit retail shelves in July and August, sources indicate.
<b>Kraft Foods</b> is infiltrating the growing snack bar category for the first time with a new line of <b>Jell-O branded bars called Dessert Delights</b>...The Jell-O 
Dessert Delights, cakelike crusts topped with a choice of cheesecake, lemon or chocolate fudge pudding fillings...
<b>Breakaway Foods</b> plans a summer release for its "Push n'Eat" line known as <b>IncrEdibles</b>. The Columbus, Ohio, company is packaging three kinds of frozen 
macaroni and cheese and three flavors of scrambled eggs in microwaveable cylinders similar to push-up ice cream. To eat: Insert a plastic stick into the bottom of 
the cylinder and thrust up. "No forks, no spoons, no plates, no mess!" is the company slogan.
Yes, <b>Turkey Spam</b> has surfaced in test markets in the Southeast, making it the fourth line-extension of an American luncheon meat all too familiar to GIs, who 
carried it on D-Day.
<p>
<b>[2001]</b><br>
The suburban Glen Ellyn entrepreneur has patented a product called <b>PJ Squares</b> that are thin slices of peanut butter and jelly wrapped individually, much like 
American cheese. No sticky fingers plus there's no peanut butter in the jelly jar or vice versa. The idea isn't as far-fetched as it sounds. Some of the nation's largest 
grocers, such as Wal-Mart and Kroger, started stocking PJ Squares in some Midwestern cities in April. It's now available in about 2,000 stores in 15 states, 
including Jewel and Dominick's in Illinois. A package of 10 with either grape or strawberry jelly sells for $2.99.
Extending the StarKist Tuna in a pouch concept to time-- squeezed consumers, <b>Heinz</b> this week is rolling out <b>Lunch To-Go portable salad kits</b> to be 
backed with TV tags, consumer promotions and sampling. 
<b>Unilever's Knorr</b> will attempt to cash in on baby boomers' yen for healthy foods with <b>Knorr Naturals</b>, a line of healthy and hearty soup mixes backed 
by heavy sampling, rebates...With a 15-minute cooking time, the vitamin-enriched line has no artificial preservatives, colors or sweeteners. Four 
SKUs include chunky potato with roasted onion, roasted vegetable with long grain rice, homestyle chicken noodle and potato vegetable. 
Frst came Traditional Red EZ Squirt. Then Blastin' Green. Now comes <b>Funky Purple</b>. That's Heinz's new "mystery" <b>EZ Squirt</b> color set to
 roll out next month amid much pr fanfare,TV tags and promotions with the upcoming How the Grinch Stole Christmas video release and Web site. 
Targeting parents looking for a convenient, healthy lunch box filler, <b>Tree Top</b> next month will bow <b>Fruit Rocketz</b>, the first shelf-stable apple sauce that's 
packaged in a tube. 
Though <b>Nabisco</b> had previously tinkered with its famous cookie, including a short-lived mint version, Kraft says its new <b>all-chocolate indulgence</b> 
represents the first-ever "permanent flavor change" for Oreo, the nation's biggest-selling cookie product.
<b>Unilever Bestfoods</b> will spend $35 million in consumer marketing for the launch this spring of a line of microwaveable spaghetti meals dubbed <b>Ragu 
Express</b> that it hopes will boost the pasta sauce category out of the doldrums. 
Nabisco Biscuit Co. is gearing up for a Ritz blitz. In an effort to extend the leading cracker brand beyond its current 46o million in sales, Nabisco is readying a 
variety of new product introductions, the first among them a new line of <b>Mini Ritz</b> supported with an estimated sio million in advertising beginning in
 January [2001]. 
<p>
<b>[2002]</b><br>
<b>General Mills</b> will marry its Progresso and Betty Crocker brands when it rolls out <b>Complete Meals</b> this month,the first shelf-stable complete dinner kit under the 
Betty Crocker brand, to be touted in a national multi-media effort. 
<b>ConAgra's Orville Redenbacher's will roll out the first mini-size popcorns for its microwaveable Movie Theater Butter and Smart Pop Butter</b> lines 
and a regular size low-fat version of microwaveable Smart Pop Kettle Korn to be touted in a national TV and print push. Portion control and portability are the 
hallmarks of the mini bags.
Unilever Bestfoods is rolling out a variety of <b>Lipton Side Dishes</b> it will support with a $13 million national print campaign later this month that will position the line 
as mother's little helper...Bestfoods is shoring up the shelf-stable side dish franchise with three new sub-brands: Risotto (two SKUs) and Mashed Potatoes & 
Gravy (two SKUs). 
<b>Kellogg</b> will start to ship <b>Cinnamon Marshmallow ScoobyDoo cereal</b> later this month, 
As part of its push to roll out about 80 new products in 2002, <b>General Mills</b> this summer will launch the <b>first yogurt-flavored granola bars from Nature 
Valley </b>
With stagnant cereal aisle sales forcing marketers to get creative, <b>Kellogg</b> next month will extend its <b>PopTarts brand with a new Snak-Stix version</b>, backed by a
 national integrated marketing push as well as a packaging overhaul. <b>Pop-Tarts Snak-Stix</b> are frosted Pop-Tarts in candy bar-like form with cookies & creme, 
caramel chocolate or double chocolate fillings. 
<b>General Mills</b> will turn its Yoplait yogurt into a meal with <b>Nouriche</b>, a nonfat yogurt smoothie fortified with 20 vitamins and minerals, set to launch in Western
 and Southwestern test markets this summer.
Take a swig of <b>White Cranberry Juice Drink from Ocean Spray</b> ($3.29 for a 64-ounce bottle). Made from white cranberries, the beverage is less tart than its 
rosy relative, yet contains the same number of calories (120 per 8 ounces) and is equally rich in vitamin C. 
<p>
<b>[2003]</b><br>
<b>McDonald's introduces a line of three Premium Salads</b> with a choice of warm grilled or crispy chicken, including the California Cobb, with premium 
mixed greens, grape tomatoes, shaved carrots, crumbled blue cheese, hickory-smoked bacon, chopped egg and Newman's Own California Cobb Dressing. Also 
available is a Caesar Salad, with mixed greens, grape tomatoes, shaved carrots, grated Parmesan cheese, savory garlic croutons and Newman's Own Creamy 
Caesar Dressing. Rounding out the trio is a Bacon Ranch Salad, made with mixed greens, grape tomatoes, shaved carrots, Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheeses, 
hickory-smoked bacon and Newman's Own Ranch Dressing. Also, Newman's Own Light Balsalmic Vinaigrette Dressing is another option.
KELLOGG CO.'S SPECIAL K CEREAL touts one of the most remarkable turnarounds of a mature brand in recent history.The cereal was going stale in the U.S.
 in 2001. Sales of the brand introduced in 1955 were slumping, and its Special K Plus line extension had just bombed. It took freeze-dried strawberries to heat
 things up. Added to the cereal to create <b>Special K Red Berries</b>, Kellogg experienced its most successful new-product launch in more than a decade. 
NESTLE USA will put $13 million in marketing behind the launch of its <b>Toll House Ultimates</b> refrigerated cookie dough in an effort to reach an 
upscale adult target and continue double-digit growth in the category. The higher-priced Ultimates, including White Macadamia Nut and Peanut Butter Cup 
Chocolate Chip varieties, feature fewer, bigger cookies per package. They use premium ingredients to appeal to adults as a "special treat" rather than as something
 they would make for kids, a Nestle spokeswoman said.
Parmalat will introduce to the U.S. next month one of its hottest European cookie brands with a revamp it hopes will become a profit ringer for the privately owned
 Italian company. Sold under the name Parmalat Bed & Breakfast cookies in Europe, the premium line will be folded under the Archway brand, the No. 3 cookie
 maker behind Kraft's Nabisco and Kellogg's Keebler. Renamed <b>Bed & Breakfast Crispy Classics</b>, the cookie line has been expanded with new flavors, 
including chunky chocolate chip, white chocolate macadamia and fruit-center SKUs to fill the demand for textured cookies. 
<b>Kellogg has been hawking Tony's Cinnamon Krunchers</b>, its new kids cereal launching next month, to the trade as a "winning combination" that will reap great 
profits for retailers. 
Kraft hopes to squeeze out its long list of rivals on the breakfast table with the first significant launch behind its Philadelphia Cream Cheese franchise in two years, 
<b>Philadelphia To-Go Bagel & Cream Cheese</b>, an all-in-one breakfast convenience food.
KRAFT FOODS' will launch a nutritious line of Lunchables in January [2004], backed by a major media push, in a bid to boost the faltering $6oo million-plus
 brand, which has been vilified by the press as one of the culprits in the childhood-obesity epidemic. The <b>Oscar Mayer</b> Lunchables franchise, suffering from flat to
 dedining sales compared with the double-digit gains of early last year, will be buoyed by the introduction of four varieties dubbed <b>Fun Fuel</b> that are developed in 
conjunction with the USDA Food Pyramid Guide.
<p>
<b>[2004]</b><br>
<b>Sara Lee will launch three extra-fiber, fortified breads under its EarthGrains brand</b>: whole wheat, whole wheat with honey, and multigrain. Each offers 
35% of current fiber guidelines with two slices
Hershey's Foods is tantalizing low-carb enthusiasts who have a sweet tooth with <b>Hershey's 1 g Sugar Carb bars</b>.
Pop Rocks will partner with Mott's to bring its "Entertainment for the mouth" experience to apple sauce with the launch this month of <b>Magic Mix-ins</b>, a 
kid-targeted product that changes color with flavor-popping vitamin C crystals.
Mr. Friedmann pointed to a variety of new products and ad initiatives Kraft is launching, especially in the health and wellness arena, among them a new <b>Carb 
Well </b>
sub-brand of no-carb Kraft salad dressings and low-carb BBQ sauce; a 10-calorie version of its kid-targeted Kool-Aid pouches dubbed <b>Kool-Aid Jammers</b> 
10; 
and <b>Crystal Light Sunrise</b>, a powdered breakfast drink that has 100% daily requirement of vitamin C and is a good source of calcium.
THE BILLION-DOLLAR rice category heats up this month with the simultaneous launch of two ready-to-serve lines from <b>Uncle Ben's</b> and Zatarain's that are 
ready in less than 90 seconds...<b>Ready Rice</b>, which includes five varieties of steam-in-pouch rice side dishes with flavors such as Roasted Chicken and Long Grain
 & Wild, is "about delivering ultra-convenience for the consumer at a time when she is as time-stressed as she's ever been," said Bryan Crowley, senior brand 
manager for Uncle Ben's...Ads for Flavorful began in November. TV ads for Ready Rice, from Omnicom Group's TBWA/Chiat/Day, Playa del Rey, Calif., will 
begin in spring. <b>Zatarain's New Orleans Style Rice</b> will launch its standup pouches of ready-to-serve flavored rice mixes with a major TV blitz beginning in 
February from Peter A. Mayer Advertising, New Orleans.
AT A TIME WHEN consumers typically begin the new year with resolutions for a healthier lifestyle, <b>Kellogg</b> will launch a potassium-rich 
<b>Corn Flakes with Real Bananas</b> and a heart-healthy <b>Smart Start Soy</b> this month with a combined $30 million marketing program.
<p>
<b>[2005]</b><br>
Die-hard fans of reality television can now try some of those grotesque stunts at home. <b>Brand New Products</b>, a company based in Chicago, has 
introduced a <b>line of edibles based on Fear Factor</b>. "What appealed to us was the gross-out factor and the longevity of the Fear Factor brand," says Steven Faso, the company's 
founder. Offerings include a slimy sour-candy octopus marinating in a plastic pouch, a bacon-flavored <b>Gross-Out Gummy Pig-Out Platter</b>, and green gummy frogs 
legs with white candy bones-plus a tub of red candy "blood" for dipping. But the company's pride and joy is a carton of crunchy larvae, made with real baby worms
 from California that have been freezedried and coated with flavors like cheddar cheese and Mexican spice. Such novelty or "extreme" confections are the fastest-
growing segment of the $23 billion candy market in the U.S., according to a recent report. And the <b>Jelly Belly Candy Company has faithfully created the 
Bertie Bolt's Every Flavor Beans enjoyed by Harry Potter</b> (the series is published by Scholastic Inc.). Flavors include rotten egg, bacon, earwax, dirt, and 
soap. Yum!
Today, the No. 2 fast-food chain [Burger King] launches its <b>Enormous Omelet Sandwich</b>. How enormous? For those counting: one sausage patty, two eggs, 
two American cheese slices and three strips of bacon. On a bun. or those still counting, that's four layers of breakfast with 730 calories oozing 47 grams of fat. For 
about $2.99, depending on the market.
More Americans are eager to add fish oil to their diets because of its health benefits -- but they don't particularly want to eat fish, judging from consumption rates
 that are low relative to meat and chicken. So food manufacturers are introducing products enriched with fish oil, which contains the omega-3 fatty acids that protect
 against heart attack and stroke. Last month, <b>Wegmans, a Northeastern grocery chain with 68 stores, introduced the first omega-3 bread made with fish 
oil</b>. Another product, <b>Coromega, is a creamy, orange-flavored emulsion that can be mixed into yogurt or smoothies</b>. Manufacturers say a variety of 
technologies keep the products from tasting fishy -- which is a relief when you're breakfasting on fish-oil toast slathered with fish-oil spread.
<p>
<b>[2006]</b><br>
<b>McDonald's Corp</b>. on Wednesday said it will start selling a snack- size chicken wrap in late July to spur U.S. sales.The $1.29
 <b>Chicken Snack Wrap</b> will be McDonald's newest product, said North America President Ralph Alvarez. The Oak Brook-based company has added an Asian 
chicken salad, a spicy chicken sandwich and a stronger coffee blend since January after growth slowed in 2005.
Last fall, Union Foods Newcorp. of Irvine, Calif., launched several ramen-noodle products, including <b>Gourmet Snack Noodles Soup</b> and <b>Mamma 
Mia microwaveable noodles</b>, that are low in sodium, have no monosodium glutamate and no trans fats. The company also is pushing new noodle lines 
infused with vegetables, as well as ones with spices and sauces that appeal to different ethnic tastes.
<p>
<b>[2007]</b><br>
Responding to consumer demand for convenient, on-the-go meals, Chicken of the Sea International has launched two new products, <b>Peel & Eat Tuna and 
Salmon Cups</b>; and <b>Lunch Solutions</b>. Peel & Eat Cups contain 2.8 oz. of either wild-caught tuna or salmon. Lunch Solutions, also with tuna or salmon, are packed 
with crackers. Both products are available in four flavor varieties, including Honey BBQ Salmon and Teriyaki Tuna. For more information, call (877) 
THE-MERMAID or visit www.chickenofthesea.com. Chicken of the Sea
<b>Kraft's Fresh Creations salads</b>, which include lettuce along with Oscar Mayer meat, Planters nuts and Kraft cheese and salad dressing, are being tested in 
Boston and Denver, where ads tout them as alternatives to restaurant salads. Kraft also has been rolling out new chicken-salad kits, without lettuce, under its South
 Beach Diet brand in stores nationwide this month...For Sara Lee, the new salads are the first step in its effort to take its Hillshire Farm brand beyond the sausage
 links and lunch meat for which it is known. Sara Lee plans to expand the brand into even more product categories in coming months, although it won't specify yet
 what those are. "As convenient and quick as a hot link is to put in a bun for dinner, we have to look at what else we can offer," says Kim Feil, chief marketing
 officer of Sara Lee's food-and-beverage unit.
It's been a decade since Kraft's last big idea--the DiGiorno Rising Crust Pizza. And the Northfield-based food giant says it is ready to unveil its next blockbuster 
product--<b>DiGiorno Ultimate</b>.
