<b>What is Tex-Mex cuisine?</b><br>
Food historians tell us TexMex cuisine originated hundreds of years ago when Spanish/Mexican
recipes 
combined with Anglo fare. TexMex, as we Americans know it today, is a twentieth century
phenomenon.
Dictionaries and food history sources confirm the first print evidence of the term "Tex Mex"
occured in the
1940s. Linguists remind us  words are often used for several years before they appear  in print.
TexMex 
restaurants first surfaced ouside the southwest region in cities with large Mexican populations.
The gourmet
Tex Mex "fad" began in the 1970s. Diana Kennedy, noted Mexican culinary expert, is credited for
elevating 
this common food to trendy fare. These foods appealed to the younger generation. 
<p>
<b>What is Tex-Mex?</b><br>
"Tex-Mex food might be described as native foreign food, contradictory through that term may
seem, It is native, for it does not exist elsewhere; it was born on this soil. But it is foreign in that
its inspiration came from an alien cuisine; that it has never merged into the mainstream of
American cooking and remains alive almost solely in the region where it originated..."<br>
---<i>Eating in America</i>, Waverly Root & Richard de Rochemont [William Morrow:New
York] 1976 (p. 281)
<p>
[1940s]
"Tex-Mex. A combination of the words "Texan" and "Mexican," first printed in 1945, that refers
to an
adaptation of Mexican dishes by Texas cooks. It is difficult to be precise as to what distinguishes
Tex-Mex
from true Mexican food, except to say that the variety of the latter is wider and more regional,
whereas
throughout the state and, now, throughout the entire United States."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New
York] 1999 (p.
325)
<p>
<b>[1950s]</b>
"Mexican restaurants, whos popularity coincided with the arrival of large numbers of Mexican
immigrants after 1950,
have for the most part followed the from and style of what is called "Tex-Mex" food, and
amalgam of Northern Mexican
peasant food with Texas farm and cowboy fare. Chili, which some condsider Texas's state dish,
was unknown in Mexico
and derived from the ample use of beef in Texan cooking. "Refried beans" are a mistranslation of
the Mexican dish
frijoles refritos, which actually means well-fried beans...The combination platter of enchiladas,
tacos, and tortillas
became the unvarying standards of the Tex-Mex menu, while new dishes like chimichangas
(supposedly invented in the
the 1950s at El Charro restaurant in Tucson, Arizona) and nachos (supposedly first served at a
consession at Dallas's
State Fair of Texas in 1964...) were concocted to please the American palate....One Tex-Mex
item that may someday
rival the pizza as an extraordinarily successful ethnic dish is the fajita...introduced at Ninfa's in
Houston on July 13,
1973, as tacos al carbon. No one knows when or where it acquired the name fajita, which means
girdle' or'strip' in
Spanish and refers to the skirt steak originally used in the preparation...Only in the last decade has
refined, regional
Mexican food taken a foot-hold in American cities, reflecting not only the tenets of Tex-Mex
cookery by the cuisines of
Mexico City, the Yucatan, and other regions with long-standing culinary traditions."<br>
---<i>America Eats Out</i>, John Mariani [William Morrow:New York] 1991 (p. 80-1) 
<p>
<b>[1970s]</b><br>
"In the good old days, Texans went to "Mexican restaurants" and ate "Mexican food." Then in
1972, The Cuisines of
Mexico, an influential cookbook by food authority Diana Kennedy, drew the line between
authentic interior Mexican
food and the "mixed plates" we ate at "so-called Mexican restaurants" in the United States.
Kennedy and her friends in
the food community began referring to Americanized Mexican food as "Tex-Mex," a term
previously used to describe
anything that was half-Texan and half-Mexican. Texas-Mexican restaurant owners considered it
an insult. By a strange
twist of fate, the insult launched a success. For the rest of the world, "Tex-Mex" had an exciting
ring. It evoked images of
cantinas, cowboys and the Wild West. Dozens of Tex-Mex restaurants sprang up in Paris, and the
trend spread across
Europe and on to Bangkok, Buenos Aires and Abu Dhabi. Tortilla chips, margaritas and chili con
carne are now well-known around the world."

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Bunuelos & churros</b></font><br>
The history of bunuelos and churros can be traced to ancient
     peoples. <a href="foodfaq1.html#fritters">fritters</a> were known to many cultures and cuisines; each evolving
     according to local tastes and customs. These foods were introduced to Mexico by
     Spanish settlers. There are several foods closely related to bunuelos and churros: <a href="foodmexican.html#sopaipillas">sopaipillas & fry bread</a>. In other countries, simliar recipes evolved as 
<a href="foodfaq1.html#doughnuts">doughnuts, funnel cake, and waffles</a>.
 <p>

<b>About bunuelos</b><p>
"Most countries have their version of bunuelos, or fritters, either sweet or savory, and they are certainly great favorites throughout
Spain and Latin America. In many parts of Mexico bunuelos are made of a stiffer dough, which is rolled out thin anywhere up to 12
inches in diameter and then fried crisp and staked up ready for use. In Uruapan...they are broken into small pieces and heated\
quickly in a thick syrup of piloncillo, the raw sugar of Mexico. These of Veracruz are very much like the churros of Spain, but 
flavored with aniseeds, and served with a syrup."<br>
---<i>The Cuisines of Mexico</i>, Diana Kennedy [Harper Row:New York] 1972 (p. 329-330)
     <p>
     <b>About churros</b><p>
     
 
     "At every Spanish festival or carnival, one is sure to find a huge cauldron of
     bubbling oil where Churros are quickly fried, shaped into loops, and threaded into
     reeds that are then knotted for easy carrying. They are meant to be purchased
     immediately after frying, usually by the dozens, and are munched on by visitors as
     they wander about taking tin the sights. Churros are nothing more than fried batter
     of flour and water, but they are essential to a Spanish breakfast, dipped either in
     sugar or in a cup of coffee or thick hot chocolate...If one is out on an all-night
     binge--a juerga, as it is called--it is the custom to end the evening by eating
     Churros and hot chocolate at the churreria, or churro store, which opens by dawn."<br>

<a name="burritos">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Burritos</b></font><br>
Burritos, as we Americans know them today, pair ancient culinary traditions with contemporary expectations.
What makes burritos different from most other Mexican-American foods is the metamorhpasis of this dish. We tracked down the 
earliest print references for "burritos" cited by food history in American/English reference books. They are nothing like the burritos we are
 served today. "What" modern burritos are is easily defined. "When" & "where" did the change happen? Early 1960s, Southern 
California. "Who" & "why" remain a mystery. Our survey of historic newspapers suggest food trucks played a roll. 
Burritos are
efficient, economical, easy & delicious.

"Burrito. A tortilla rolled and cooked on a griddle, then filled with a variety of condiments. Burritos
are a Mexican-American staple. The word, from Spanish for "little donkey," first saw print in
America in 1934. If fried, the burrito becomes a chimichanga."<br>

depression in the middle of each and fill with chichiarrones. 1962 Mulvey & Alvares Good Food from Mexico (rev. ed.) iii.81 Burritos in the northern
part of Mexico and in the southwestern part of the United States are quite different. Now a popular dish in many restaurants and taco

seasoned to taste with chili."<br>
---<i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, 22nd edition 
<p>
<b>Burros?</b><br>
Our regional cookbooks confirm "burros" are indeed a larger version of "burritos" in Arizona and surrounding areas. The "ito" suffix denotes a smaller version of the 
original item. <p>
"...in the Sonora and southeastern Arizona, some people make tortillas out of wheat, as well as, corn. Not just tortillas, but huge regional tortillas, often well over 
twenty inches in diameter. Wrapped around some sort of filling, they are called burros or burritos, depending upon the size. Burros can be filled with anything...If 
you deep-fry a burro it becomes a chimichanga--a truly local dish from Another Arizona or northern Sonora." <br>

Chile peppers are "New World" foods, so it stands to reason Native Americans (from South/Central
America/American Southwest) ate them before the European Explorers discovered these lands. Hot chile peppers
were sometimes combined with tomatoes to form an early version of salsa. It is important to note that there are many
different kinds of peppers: sweet, bell, Holland. Some of these were introduced later by scientists. Hungarian famous 
<a href="foodsoups.html#paprika">paprika</a> is derived from this commodity. Wilbur <a href="http://www.tabasco.com/info_booth/faq/scoville_how.cfm">

<b>Origins</b><br>
"The fruits of Capsicum species seem to have a magnetic attraction for confusing colloquila nomes. It began with Columbus
discovering them on his first voyage and calling them peppers of the Indies, initiating a mix-up which has lasted to this day...
This fruit with many names brows on plants of the genus Capsicum, members of the Solanacae family like the tomatoes and potatoes...
There were three species, or species groups, of cultivated chiles in ancient America...The white-flowered and white seeded Capsicum
annum, chinense, Capsicum annum was in Mexico to be found, wild, in cultural deposits in the Tehuacan valley dating from 
7200 to 5200 B.C..."<br>
---<i>America's First Cuisines</i>, Sophie D. Coe [University of Texas Press:Austin TX] 1994 (p. 60-61)
<p>
"Wild chillies were being gathered and eaten in Mexico c.7000BC, and were cultivated there before 3500 BC."<br>

<b>Chile pepper migration</b><br>
"Interestingly...it was not the Spanish who were responsible
for the early diffusion of New World food plants. Rather, it was the Portuguese, aided by local traders following long-used trade
routes, who spread American plants though the Old World with almost unbelievable rapidity...Unfortunately, documentation for the 
routes that chilli peppers followed from the Americas is not as plentiful as that for other New World economic plants...
it is highly probable that capsicums accompanied the better-documented Mesoamerican food complex of corn, beans, and squash, as peppers
have been closely associated with these plants throughout history...The fiery new spice was readily accepted by the 
natives of Africa and India...From India, chilli peppers traveled...not only along the Portuguese route back around Africa to Europe but also over ancient trade routes that led
either to Europe via the Middle East or to monsoon Asia...In the latter cakes, if the Portuguese had not carried chilli peppers
to Southeast Asia and Japan, the new spice would have been spread by Arabic, Gujurati, Chinese, Malaysian, Vietnamese, and Javanese
traders...In the Szechuan and Hunan provinces in China, where many New World foods were established within the lifetime of the 
Spanish conquistadors, there were no read leading from the coast. Nonetheless, American foods were known there by the middle of the
sixteenth century, having reached these regions via caravan routes from the Ganges River through Burma and across western 
China..."<br>
---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kenneth F. Kiple & Kriemhild Conee Ornelas [Cambridge University Press:Cambridge], Volume One, 2000 (p. 282)
<p>
<b>Chile peppers travel to Europe</b><br>
"Despite a European 'discovery' of the Americas, chilli peppers diffused throughout Europe in circuitous fashion. Following the 
fall of Granada in 1492, the Spaniards established dominance over the western Mediterranean while the Ottoman Turks succeeded
power in northern Africa...the Mediterranean became...two separate seas divided by Italy, Malta, Sicily, with little or no trade or
contact between the eastern and western sections. Venice was the center of the spice and Oriental trade of central Europe, and Venice
depended on the Ottoman Turks...From central Europe the trade went to Antwerp and the rest of Europe, although Antwerp also received
Far Eastern goods from the Portuguese via India, Africa, and Lisbon. It was along these avenues that chili peppers traveled into much
of Europe. They were in Italy by 1535...Germany by 1542...England before 1538...the Balkans before 1569...and Moravia by 1585...But
except in the Balkans and Turkey, Europeans did not make much use of chilli peppers until the Napoleonic blockade cut off their supply
of spices and they turned to Balkan paprika as a substitute. Prior to that, Europeans had mainly grown capsicums in containers
as ornamentals."<br>
---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i> (p. 282)
<p>
"We know that Columbus was the first European to see Native Americans consuming capsicum peppers, and our word for them reveals that
he was really searching for black pepper and called these 'pimiento' with as much enthusiasm as he called the natives 'Indians.' 
But the very fact that they could also be found far away as China within a few years has led some scholars to suggest that they 
may have reached Asia even before they did Europe. It is certain though that the Portuguese brought peppers to their colonies in 
Asia. Peppers were first described in Europe in the German herbal of Leonard Fuchs in 1542, but he thought they came from India. 
Like several other New World imports though, it appears that poor people were the only ones willing to eat them; they are not even mentioned
in cookbooks which naturally catered to a literate and elite audience."<br>
---<i>Food in Early Modern Europe</i>, Ken Albala [Greenwood Press:Westport CT] 2003 (p. 32)
<p>
"Chile is historically associated with the voyage of Columbus (Heiser 1976). Columbus is given credit for introducing chile to Europe, and subsequently to Africa 
and to Asia. On his first voyage, he encountered a plant whose fruit mimicked the pungency of the black pepper, Piper nigrum L. Columbus called it red pepper 
because the pods were red. The plant was not the black pepper, but a heretofore unknown plant that was later classified as Capsicum. Capsicum is not related to
 the Piper genus. In 1493, Peter Martyr (Anghiera 1493) wrote that Columbus brought home "pepper more pungent than that from the Caucasus." Chile spread 
rapidly across Europe into India, China, and Japan. The new spice, unlike most of the solanums from the Western Hemisphere, was incorporated into the cuisines
 instantaneously. Probably for the first time, pepper was no longer a luxury spice only the rich could afford. Since its discovery by Columbus, chile has been 
incorporated into most of the world's cuisines. It has been commercially grown in the United States since at least 1600, when Spanish colonists planted seeds and
 grew chile using irrigation from the Rio Chama in northern New Mexico (DeWitt and Gerlach 1990)."---

"A few new spices reached Britain after the end of the Middle Ages. The Spaniards brought back from Central America several 
members of the capsicum family, which were naturalized in southern Europe. The larger fruits were imported thence into England 
under the name of Guinea pepper. The smallest, reddest and hottest of the American capsicums, when dried and powdered,
produced cayenne pepper, the 'chyan' of English eighteenth century recipe books."<br>

"The use of the term pepper for fruits of the capsicum family dates from the eighteenth century, an allusion to the similar
pungency of taste. In particular it refers to the Capsicum annuum, a native of tropical America, which is generally called more fully
the sweet pepper (an alternative name in American English is bell pepper)."<br>

"The word "cayenne" seems to come from kian, the name of the pepper among the Tupi Indians of northeastern South America. The pod type 
probably originated in what is now French Guiana and was named after either the Cayenne River of the capital of the country,
cayenne. It owes its spread to Portugal, whose traders carried it to Europe, Africa, India, and Asia. Although it probably
was introduced into Spain before 1500, its circuitous route caused it to be transferred to Britain from India in 1548...In 1597, the
botanist John Gerard referred to cayenne as "ginnie or Indian pepper" in his herbal, and in his influential herbal of 1652, Nicholas
Culpepper wrote that cayenne was "this violent fruit" that was of considerable service to "help digestion, provoke urine, 
relieve toothache, preserve the teeth from rottenness, comfort a cold stomach, expel the stone from the kidney, and take away
dimness of sight." Cayenne appeared in Miller's The Gardener's and Botanist's Dictionary in 1768, proving it was being cultivated 
in England--at least in home gardens."<br>

<b>Chile peppers in coolonial America</b><br>
"Peppers of the annuum species were transferred into what is now the American Southwest--first
by birds and then by humankind. Botanists believe that the wild annum variety known as
chiltepins spread northward from Mexico through dissemination by birds long before Native
Americans domesticated peppers and made them part of their trade goods. These chiltepins still
grow wild today in Arizona and in South Texas, where they are known as chilipiquins. According
to most accounts, chile peppers were introduced the second time into what is now known the
United States by Calitan General Juan de Onate, who founded Sante Fe in 1609. However, they
may have been introduced to the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico by the Antonio Espejo
expedition of 1582-83. According to one of the members of the expedition..."They have no chile,
but the native were given some seed to plant." But by 1601, chiles were not on the list of Indian
crops, according to colonist Francisco de Valverde..But soon chiles were being grown by Spanish
and Indians alike.. We do know that soon after the Spanish arrived, the cultivation of peppers in
New Mexico spread rapidly and the pods were grow both in Spanish settlements and native
pueblos...During the 1700s, peppers were popping up in other parts of the country. In 1768,
according to legend, Minorcan settlers in St. Augustine, Florida, introduced the datil pepper, a
land race of the Chinese species...Other introductions were also occuring during the eighteenth
century. In 1785, George Washington planted two rows of "bird peppers" and one row of cayenne
at Mount Vernon, but it is not known how he acquired the seed. Another influential American,
Thomas Jefferson, was also growing peppers from seed imported from Mexico. By the early
1800s, commercial seed varieties became available to the American public. In 1806 a botanist
named McMahon listed four varieties for sale, and in 1826, another botanist named Thornburn
listed "Long' (cayenne), "Tomato-Shaped' (squash), 'Bell' (oxheart), 'Cherry' and 'Bird' (West
Indian) peppers as available for gardeners. Two years later, squash peppers were cultivated in
North American gardens and that same year (1828), the 'California Wonder Bell' pepper was first
named and grown commercially." <br>

"Bell pepper is a large, flesh mild green pepper, turning into red or gold when fully ripe.
Sturtevant cites Lionel Wafer in 1699, who mentions Bell-pepper and Bird-pepper as growing in
the Ithsmus of America, and Edward Long in 1774, who lists nine varieties of Capsicum as being
under cultivation in Jamaica; of these, "the Bell is esteemed most proper for pickling," Sturtevant
repeats. Among numerous references to Capsicum by Jefferson, one unmistakably refers to bell
pepper, seeds of which were sent from Mexico in 1824: 'Large Pepper, a good salad the seeds
being removed." Plantings of Piperoni in 1774 and Capsicum Major in 1812, among others,
would seem to refer to bell pepper as well. Cayenne pepper (Capsicum frutenscens L. var.
longum Bailey) was planted by Jefferson as early as 1767. The presence of hot peppers in the
West Indies had been chronicled since 1494, according to Sturtevant. Long pepper was a popular
name for the elongated cayenne, but it had been appropriated from the eastern Piper longum, the
fruit spikelet of which had fallen into disuse by the time of the voyages of discovery. The use of
capsicum peppers seems to have come to Virginia by way of the West Indies (see Pepper Pot an
Gumbo, for instance). The choice of pepper for Pepper Vinegar is not altogether clear. I opt for
cayenne because of the implied heat in comparing the flavor to that of black pepper; also
Jefferson correspondence in 1813 (Garden Book) refers to vinegar in which cayenne is steeped
brine used as seasoning. (This must have been the basis for later southern barbecue mixtures.)
However, some argue for the use of mild pepper in this recipe, but I think that Mrs. Randolph
would have so specified. In any event, the use of hot peppers in traditional Virginia cookery
was highly skilled and discreet, just enough to brighten the taste, not to set it afire." <br>

flour. The yolks are not added to the whites until the moment the chiles are fried. Take this precaution. The other way makes the 
batter very think and the chiles don't fry well, because they have to be coated well with the egg to come out right. For fifteen 
chiles you should use 10 eggs. Don't beat the yolks until they are ready to be added to the whites at the moment you fry

Pick up each with a spoon and transfer to a saucer; then slide from saucer into about 1 1/2 inches of moderately hot oil in your

<a name="chiliconcarne">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Chili con carne</b></font><br>
Chili, a new world recipe, originally meant beans served in a spicy tomato sauce. This
nutritionally balanced combination was known to ancient Aztec and Mayan cooks. Food
historians generally agree chili con carne is an American recipe with Mexican roots.
"Con carne" means with meat (Carne is the Spanish word for meat). Our survey of historic newspapers
suggests the <a href="foodmexican.html#originalchili">original recipe</a> was just chili (powder) and meat.
<p>
Today in the United States, chile con carne is usually a combination of beans, sauce
and ground beef. It can be made at home, selected from restaurant menus or
purchased (ready-made or in kits) from food stores. Dedicated southwestern chili
afficionados concentrate on spices, not the meat. Unless? Of course, they live in
Texas. 
<p>
"Chili con carne sounds authentically Spanish, which it could hardly be, for the Spaniards had
never seen a chili before they reached America; it was an element of Indian, not of Spanish,
cooking. The Spanish name could have been explained by a Mexican origin, but the only persons
who deny that provenance more vehemently than the Texans, who claim credit for it, are the
Mexicans, who deny paternity with something like indignation...This dish is believed to have been
invented in the city of San Antonio some time after the Civil War; it grew in favor after the
developement of chili powder in New Braunfels in 1902."<br>
---<i>Eating in America: A History</i>, Waverly Root and Richard De Rochemont [William
Morrow:New York] 1976 (p. 277-8)
<p>
"Instinctively, one knows that chili originated in the Southwest, was of Mexican inspiration, and
that it moved eastward to the southern states in the early part of the century. Although American
Indians used for one dish or another such chilies as could be found in various parts of America,
chili con carne was not an Indian invention. Carolyn Niethammer, in her book <i>American Indian
Food and Lore</i>, states that the tiny round chili called chillipiquin was known in New Mexico
and Arizona, but the Indians did not know the large, domesticated chilies such as those used in
chili con carne "until the Spaniards brought them [here] after passing through Mexico." The late
Frank X. Tolbert, perhaps the nation's leading historian on the subject of chili, indicates in his
book, <i>A Bowl of Red</i>, his assurance that chili originated in San Antonio, Texas."<br>
---<I>Craig Claiborne's The New York Times Food Encyclopedia</i>, compiled by Joan
Whitman [Times Books:New York] 1985 (p. 88)
<p>
"Chili con carne is a stew that consists of meat, hot chile peppers, a liquid such as water or broth, and spices. It may or may
not contain such ingredients as onions, tomatoes, or beans. Everything about chili con carne generates some sort of controversy-
the spelling of the name, the origin of the dish, the proper ingredients for a great recipe...Although archaeological 
evidence indicates that chile peppers evolved in Mexico and South America, most writers on the subject state flatly that 
chili did not orginate in Mexico. Even Mexico disclaims chili; one Mexican dictionary defines it as: "A detestable dish
sold from Texas to New York City and errouneously described as Mexican." Despite such protestations, the combiantion  of meat and 
chile peppers in stew-like concoctions is not uncommon in Mexican cooking...Mexican caldillos (thick soups or stews), moles 
(meaning "mixture"), and adobos (thick sauces) often resemble chili con carne in both appearance and taste because they all 
sometimes use similar ingredients: various types of chiles combined with meat (usually beef), onions, garlic, cumin, and 
occasionally tomatoes. But chili con carne fanatics tell strange tales about the possible origin of chili. The story of the
"lady in blue" tells of Sister Mary of Agreda, a Spanish nun in the early 1600s who never left her convent in Spain but
nonetheless had out-of-body experiences during which her spirit would be transported across the Atlantic to preach
Christianity to the Indians. After one of the return trips, her spirit wrote down the first recipe for chili con carne, which the 
Indians gage her: chile peppers, venison, onions, and tomatoes. An only slightly less fanciful account suggests that Canary
Islanders, transplanted to San Antonio as early as 1723, used local peppers nad wild onions combined with various meats to create
early chili combinations. E. De Grolyer...believed that Texas chili con carne had its origins as the "pemmican of the
Southwest" in the late 1840s...The most likely explanation for the origin of chili con carne in Texas comes from the heritage
 of Mexican food combined with the rigors of life on the Texas frontier. Most historians agree that the earliest written
description of chili came from J.C. Clopper, who lived near Houston. Hew worte of visiting San Antonio in 1828: "When they [poor fmailies
of San Antonio] have to lay for their meat in the market, a very little is made to suffice for the
family; it is generally cut into a kind of hash with nearly as many peppers as there are pieces of meat--this is all stewed 
together." Except for this one quote, which does not mention the dish by name, historians of heat can find no documented
evidence of chili in Texas before 1880. Around that time in  San Antonio, a municipal market--El Mercado--was operating in 
Military Plaza. Historian Charles Ramsdell noted that "the first rickety chili stands" were set up in this marketplace, with bols 
o'red sold by women who were called "chili queens."...A bowl o'red cost visitors like O. Henry and William Jennings Bryan a mere

<a name="chimichangas">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Chimichangas</b></font><br>
The popular theory behind the "invention" of the chimichangas (as we know them today) is that a
cook either accidentally or purposely dropped a burrito into a deep fat fryer. Most stories place
the invention of this food in Arizona (the Tucson area) just after World War II. Is this fact? Or
fiction?
<p>
     Two keys points regarding the history chimichangas: Filled tortillas/fried grain products are
thousands of years old and Tex-Mex food went mainstream in America in the 1950s. It is
interesting to note that toasted ravioli (popularly attributed to St. Louis, 1947) has a very similar
story. After World War II, American tastes expanded and ethnic restauranteurs willing to adapt
traditional dishes to accomodate pervading American expectations (fried foods, meats, & sweets)
flourished. So did deep fat fryers.
 <p>    
<b>This is what a respected American food historian has to say about chimichangas...</b><br>
"A deep-fried wheat tortilla stuffed with minced beef, potatoes, and seasonings. The term was
long considrerd a nonsense word-a Mexican version of "whatchamacallit" or
"thingamajig"--reputedly coined in the 1950s in Tucson, Arizona, although Diana Kennedy, in her
<i>Cuisines of
Mexico</i> (1972) reports that fried burritos in Mexico are called by the similar name
chimichangas. But in <i>The Food Lovers Handbook to the Southwest</i>, Dave DeWitt and
Mary Jane Wilan noted that Tucson writer Janet Mitchell found that  chang'a means female
monkey in Spanish and  a chimney of the hearth. When put together this becomes,
according to Jim Griffith of the Arizona Southwest Folklore Center, a polite version of
"unmentionable Mexican expletive that mentions a monkey." According to DeWitt and Wilan ,
      Investigator Mitchell heard tales about the first chimichanga being created when a burro was
accidentally knocked into a deep-fat fryer, and the cook exclaimed "Chimichanga!" She had also
heard that a baked burro cooked in a bar in Nogales [Arizona] in the 1940s had been called a
toasted monkey. The logical conclusion, then, was that the idiom chimichanga means toasted
monkey and is an allusion to the golden-brown color of a deep-fried burro'."<br>

York] 1999 (p. 78)

It is interesting to note that El Charro resturant, Tucson, AZ, (one of several places that is

Cinco De Mayo celebrates a battle victory against the French in Puebla on May 5, 1862. Mexican Independence Day (September 
16th) is celebrated similarly with outdoor fiestas featuring portable foods (think: tacos, gorditas, quesadillas), 
dancing and music. Cinco de Mayo celebrations first surface in southern California in the early 20th century. 
By the 1970s, this festive holiday was celebrated in many cities throughout the USA. 
<p>
<b>What to serve?</b><br> 
Cinco de Mayo celebrates street foods of the common people. There is no specific symbolic dish connected with this holiday. 
Local fiestas hosted by people of Mexican descent often serve authentic Mexican cuisine. 
Restaurants and food industry sponsored events generally offer Americanized Mexican cuisine (think: <a href="foodmexican.html#aboutmexican">Tex-Mex</a>). 
<p>
"Cinco de Mayo almost always means a huge fiesta, with the attendant food, music and dancing to attract a multicultural 
audience, savoring such Mexican culinary delights as gorditas (thick corn tortillas sliced like pita and stuffed with 
lettuce, tomato, beef, chicken, or cheese) and bueuelos (deep-fried pastries topped with cinnamon and sugar)." <br>

"'Feliz Cinco de Mayo!'...Which means, simply: Happy Fifth of May as the Mexicans would say it. We hope it's a happy day for all of you. 
But we particularly want to extend our greeting to those of our people of Mexican ancestry and our friends out of the border. According to the 
folks at Rosarita Mexican Foods, the Fifth of May is a legal national holiday in Mexico...much like our Fourth of July. It celebrates to 
Battle of Puebla which took place against the French forces that had invaded Mexico in order to impose Austrian Archduke Maximillian and Carlotta 
as emperor and empress of Mexico. A gallant band of Mexican troops under General Zaragosa defended the city successfully. To the 
Mexican people, that decisive victory years ago has stood for one hundred and two years as a symbol of the will of our neighbor nation to resist 
European efforts to dominate Mexico. In a broader sense, that battle signified Mexico's resistance to any foreign intervention...Cinco de Mayo is a day for 
the inevitable round of speeches...and a day for fun and food...fiesta time. It's a great day for those who love liberty. So, let's get out those 
sombreros, serapes and maracas and join the fun. Even if you don't want to go dancing in the streets...you can treat your family to a real 
Mexican feast--United States...style. It's the food that interest us. Just thinking about a table laden with tempting tacos, tasty 
tamales, enchiladas, crisp tortillas, refried beans, and empanadas makes me want to celebrate...You can whip up a Mexican dinner in no time...since 
almost all of these delicacies are available at the frozen food cases or among the canned specialty foods at your nearby store. Rosarita, for example, 
packs a full line of them, modified to our palates...Even though meals of Mexican origin are common in the Southwest, particularly California, 
Arizona and Texas, about eighty per cent of our people have never tried them. They're growing like Topsy in popularity, though. For 
example, Rosarita now turns out more than one hundred and fifty thousand tortillas each day." <br>

doubt in anyone's mind about the stellar attraction at the Cinco de Mayo celebration. It was the home-cooked Mexican food, pungent 
and spicy and, as the lady said, is not like anything in a Mexican restaurant. This was Cinco de Mayo, north-of-the-border style, a second-year 
repeat project of the mothers with children in Westminster School District's Title 1 compensatory education program. American potluck, 
augmented by such gringo mainstays as macaroni salad and Boston baked beans. Rather fittingly, it took place at Sigler Park, third oldest

lived in the area four or five generations...Mississippi-born and an expert on 'way down South' cookery, Mrs. Easley had been intrigued 
with Mexican cooking and tried Mexican foods ever since she came west. 'When I came to California I thought cactus plants were 
weeds and I couldn't understand why so many Mexican-American families cultivated them--right along with the roses--in their gardens.

complicated...As an alternative, we recommend an informal party built around a buffet of simpler foods. The main dish will be tacos 
which the guests make themselves. These are not the typical tacos of the franchise stands around Los Angeles, but tacos more like those 
at stands in Mexico...They are made with tortillas heated until soft, then folded around meat and a choice of other ingredients. 
There's no deep-frying involved and no need for commercial taco shells so crisp they crack apart and spill their contents. In Mexico, 
a soft taco often includes nothing more than a little seasoned meat. A stand at the beach in Veracruz dispenses some of the 
best tacos in Mexico. They contain only slivers of barbecued pork and chopped onion mixed with a little chopped cilantro. Hot sauce 
is added only upon request. The meat for our Cinco de Mayo tacos is shredded pork, not the ground beef of American tacos. The condiments, set out in 
separate bowls, include chopped tomato, shredded cheese, shredded lettuce and salsa, either bottled or homemade. Chopped green onions can be 
combined with cilantro in one bowl or the cilantro served separately for those not accustomed to its distinctive flavor. The party starts with 
margaritas accompanied by Nachos, and appetizer of tortilla chips topped with cheese and sliced chile and heated until the cheese melts. We suggest 
ceviche or a shrimp cocktail, but in either case the sauce should be seasoned generously with lime juice. If preferred, a green 
salad could be substituted for this course. Along with the tacos there are refried beans, but flavored in a different way. The beans 
are mashed and mixed with bacon and onion and spiced with chili powder. It takes something cooling, like Sangria, t refresh palates form this 
meal. And something even cooler, Helado de Aguacate, or avocado ice cream, is the dessert. Far out? Not if you've spent any time in

Our research confirms 1971 as first print date for "fajitas," as we know them today. Below please find the <i>Oxford English 
Dictionary</i> and full text of the original source, courtesy of Barry Popick. We did not find earlier dates in ProQuest 
Newspapers, Newspaper Archives, or Diana Kennedy's books. Elena Zeyelata is referenced below. This angle might be worth

title of a popular movie in 1972. Coincidence? 
<p>
"Fajita. A Tex-Mex dish made from marinated, grilled skirt steak...served in a wheat tortilla. The
word derives from the Spanish faja, for "girdle" or "strip" and describes the cut of meat itself.
There has been much conjecture as to the fajita's origins, though none has been documented.
Grilling skirt steak over mesquite coals would be characteristic of Texas cooking since the days
when beef became a dominant meat in the American diet. But the word "fajita" did not appear in
print until 1975. In 1984 Homero Recio, a lecturer on animal science at Texas A & M University,
obtained a fellowship to study the origins of the item, coming to the conclusion two years later
that, ironically, it was his grandfather, a butcher from Premont, Texas, who may have been the
first to use the term "fajita" to describe the pieces of skirt steak cooked directly on mesquite coals
for family dinners as far back as the 1930s. Recio also hypothesized that the first restaurant to
serve fajitas--though under the name "botanzas" (appetizers)--was the Roundup in McAllen,
Texas. But Sonny "Fajita King" Falcon claimed to have opened the first "fajita stand" in Kyle,
Texas, and in 1978 a "Fajita King" stand in Austin...The popularity of the dish certainly grew after
Ninfa Laurenza introduced it on her menu at Ninfa's Restaurant in Houson Texas, on July 13,
1973, but that was under the name "tacos al carbon," and increased still further as a "fajita" after
the item was featured at the Austin Hyatt Regency Hotel, which by 1982 was selling thirteen
thousand orders per month."<br>

Until you visit Leonardos Fiesta Restaurant in Brownsville you have led a cloistered life. This likeable caballeros humor will lay you on the floor. Texas literary dudes like Dick Hitt, Frank Tolbert, Leon Hale and Richard West have yodeled praises about Leonardos colorful place. Noriega*, a bon vivant, gourmet and traveler, recommends this restaurant as a good place to ward off malnutrition. 
Leonardos fajitas are succulent enough to get one spastic with jubilation. Fajitas are the solid lean meat from beef skirts. If you cant get beef skirts, use a similar type of lean beef. They should be cut into small strips and marinated overnight. Leonardo suggests any good commercial marinate, but warns that one shouldnt use more than one-fourth of the amount called for in most instructions. 
After fajitas have been marinated they may be grilled. If barbecued, heat should be low so meat doesnt dry out. 
(p. 30)<br>
<b>Tacos al Carbon</b><br>
This is a do-it-yourself procedure. When fajitas are cooked cut into small slices. Hold a fresh tortilla in hand and fill with meat and Alice Taylors Pica de Gallo. Perfect compliments for this divine composition are frijoles and Spanish rice. 
This inexpensive dish wont paralyze your food budget."---

"[Skirt steaks]were stacked a foot deep in a six-foot wide display. But they don't call them skirt steaks in San Antonio--they call 
the fajitas. From what I was able to learn, it seems fajitas are something of a Southern Texas--or Tex-Mex-phenomenon. They have become 
popular only in the past few years, but they have become very popular. According to one meat buyer I talked to, "When I put fajitas 
in the ad, I'll go through between 100,000 and a quarter of a million pounds in a week...They even have fajita cooking contests 
in Southern Texas. I learned that the champion for the past five years was Red Gomez, a butcher from Brownsville, Texas. I called him to 
see if he would be willing to share his award-winning recipe with me. He was not." <br>

"The original fajitas were created out of necessity, not a desire to have something new. Ranchers, who usually butchered their own meat, 
kept the steaks and roasts for themselves and gave their hands what they considered the less desirable cuts, including the so-called 
skirt steak, which is a section of the diaphragm. The long, narrow, beltlike strip would be marinated overnight in lime juice to tenderize it. 
The next day it was grilled over mesquite, a cheap, plentiful wood that itself has become a cooking fad. The meat was then cut into thin 
strips, each diner filling a flour tortilla with it and with pico de gallo, a spicy relish of onions, green chilies, tomatoes and 
cilantro. Those familiar with Mexican dishes may notice the striking similarity between fajitas and tacos al carbon and carne 
asada. But tacos al carbon, a fad that preceded fajitas, are made with a better cut of meat that does not need to be marinated and 
they reach the table already rolled in tortillas. As for carne asada, it is grilled meat and vegetables. The view around here is that 
fajitas made their way north from the border to Austin about five years ago and began arriving in Dallas two years ago." <br>

"The hottest dish in town, in more ways than none, is a Texas export called fajitas. For the uninitiated, fajitas...are strips of grilled skirt 
steak served with flour tortillas, guacamole and salsa and eaten wrapped in the tortillas, taco style. If they don't come to the table 
sizzling from the grill, they are not fit to be called fajitas. In a trend sense, they are even hotter. The Houston Restaurant Assn. 
celebrated Cinco de Mayo by staging its First Annual Fajita Meet Sunday. In Pasadena, a restaurant called Manana Mexican Food and Drink of Arroyo 
parkway has erected a large sign inquiring 'Have you had your fajitas today?'..'They used to be dirt cheap. They used to almost throw 
them away, like junk,' said Bud Smith, a Texan who grew up in Pharr, near the Mexican border...In Los Angeles, the fajitas trend is 
so new that the name is virtually unknown outside of restaurants...According to Texan sources, fajitas originated in San Antonio. 
However, others day the idea came directly from Mexico. Under a different name, arrechera, skirt steak has a venerable history 
in California. The late <a href="foodmexican.html#zelayeta">Elena Zelayeta</a>, who popularized Mexican cooking in California, included a recipe for Arrechera Adobada in her 
first cookbook, 'Elena's Famous Mexican and Spanish Recipes,' published in 1944. 'I find skirt steak to be one of the best flavored, 
less expensive cuts of meat,' she wrote. In the early version of fajitas, Zelayeta marinated the meat with vinegar, oil, garlic, 
oregano, salt and pepper, then added tomato sauce and broiled it. By 1958, when 'Elena's Secrets of Mexican Cooking' was published 
she dropped the tomato sauce and cooked the meat over the coals instead of under the broiler...Fajitas have crossed the ocean to 
Paris, where they are served in Tex-Mex restaurants along with flour tortillas shipped from Amsterdam. They are also popular in 
New York and San Francisco...Beer is a popular accompaniment to fajitas...Welche commented on the meteoric popularity of skirt 
steak. 'Five or six years ago, you couldn't find skirt steak in the market. They ground it into hamburger." <br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Who was Elena Zelayeta? [1897-1974]</b></font><br>
Gifted cook, inspirational leader, respected teacher, social motivator, mom. Elena was born to innkeeping parents living
in a small Mexico mining town. Food played an important role in Elena's early life. 
When she was young, the family relocated to San Francisco. Details of these early years unfold like an
interesting menu. Elena married and had children. Her eyesight was compromised
early on; soon after her second son was born Elena was totally blind. She re-learned her kitchen and took life one day at a
time. When Elena's husband passed away unexpectedly, she
found strength in her culinary experience and used it to support her young sons. Elena opened a restaurant, taught
cooking classes, wrote books, started her own business, partnered with major USA food companies, and hosted a 
<a href="foodmexican.html#zelayetatv">TV cooking show</a>. Characterized
by contemporaries as charismatic and fun-loving, Elena's legacy touches every one of us on a deeper human level. Food 
is the fuel of physical sustenance. Zest for life enables us to savour the meal.

"Guided by her fingertips, Elena Zelayeta moves with assurance through a world of complete darkness. Besides keeping house for her family of four, she teaches cooking, 
gives lectures and writes on cooking. Baking a cake requires precise knowledge of the exact location of everything in the kitchen. The recipe is memorized and special measuring
cups are used,  one for one third cup, another for one-fourth cup, another for one-half cup. Eggs are broken into her hand and then the white drains through her
spread fingers into the bowl while the yolk remains in the palm of her hand. After ingredients are mixed, the cake is popped into the oven. After two 15-minute radio programs the
cakes is done. Her daily routine includes cleaning her own house, darning, cooking and washing. Her delicate sense of touch tells her where there is dirt or dust. Stockings
are darned over a china egg, her spools of colored thread being marked in Braille. She know foods by their odors, and spices by taste. In one year., Elena
Zelayeta canned 225 quarts of fruits and tomatoes. That year, also, she made her own Christmas presents--50 pounds of Mexican pressed quince paste, cut and 
wrapped in cellophane. Mrs. Zelayeta believes that it is fear that prevents many accomplishmebnts, and that a handicapped person is slowed down by never
defeated."<br>

"Elena Zelayeta, expert in Mexican cuisine, author and teacher of the blind, returns for a 'comman performance' at the Times College of Wartime Cookery...Since her
first appearance here in October, Elena has obtained a guide dog, and Chulita will appear at The Times with her new mistress...Elena, although blind for 10 years, conducts
a cooking school in San Francisco in addition to caring for her home and family. She is a charming, vivacious woman who has become popular as a lecturer because of her
vivid personality and gayety. Watching her grace and sureness as she goes about preparing delightful Mexican and Spanish food in The Times stage kitchen, it is 
difficult to believe that she is guided only by her amazing sense of touch...She has a talent for teaching others how to duplicate her masterpieces, and at The Times class wil
show how to mix and cook such favorites as tamales, chili rellenos, tacos de gallina, enchiladas and ante. Ante is a delectable custard, cake and fruit dessert
concoction."<br>

"Elena Zelayeta, well-known for her cookbooks on Mexican food, lrelated of few of her recipes for happy living during a recent 
luncheon in the Costa Mesa County Club. The 71-year-old blind authoress and food consultant delighted about 100 members of the 
Friends of the Costa Mesa Library by revealing an ability to be light-hearted about tragedies she has experienced. 'There is little we can
do about our problmes,' she explained, 'but I have learned there is a great deal we can do about ourselves.' Mrs. Zelayeta lost her sight when
her youngest son was 1 year old. After experiencing a normal amount of self-pity she decided to start serving her family. She
discharged a housekeeper and cooked her first meal since the loss of her sight. 'I looked for a scouring pad just before sering
the meal and coulnt' find it, she said. 'I put the ladle in the soup and up it came full of scouring pad. I won't tell you what I did 
next but we're all still alive.' She relearned cooking techniques...She makes sure tortillas don't burn by turning them until they
'smell' done. Mrs. Zelayeta began tacing cooking to other blind adults at the San Francisco Center for the Blind. 'I learned that
serving others is living,' she said. 'When we stop doing things for other people we stop existing.' Ten years later her husband was
killed in an automobile accident and 'I took inventory of what I could do. It was cooking so I wrote my first cookbook with the intention of 
buying a seeing eye dog with the profits.' Mrs. Zelayeta was born in Mexico of Spanish descent and all her cookbooks deal with the 
Mexican food with which she is so familiar...Soon she was asked by the U.S. Government to teach a course in 'practical living'
at a Lion's Club camp in Montana. 'I was certain I couldn't do it. I never had a course in psychology.' The she read some and decided.
'Why not? Each of the ones I read disagreed with the others and I thought no one would be able to tell if (what I taught) was
right wrong anyway.' But, she was afraid. 'How do you deal with fear?' the woman--who stands about 4 feet 6 inches--asked
the group. 'It's done by trusting that your needs will be met if you take the human footsteps to find the hapiness you're seeking.'
The happiest person, she said, it the one who entertains the most interesting thoughts...Mrs. Zelayeta is consultant for a large food-
seasoning concern and has served as food adviser for a New York restaurant."<br>

"Elena Zelayeta was blind, but she opened many eyes to the delights for her native Mexican cookery. More than that, she inspired others to 
overcome a handicap which once had plunged her into months of despair. And she won the affection of countless admirers, to whom she is 
known simply as Elena. Mrs. Zelayeta died in San Francisco March 31 at the age of 76...Although Elena is gone, her recipes and happy
philosophy will live on in her four cookbooks and other writings...Born in in Mexicto City, Elena was raised in the mining town of El Mineral del Oro, where her parents were 
innkeepers. Her mother and the employes at the inn taught her to cook. The family moved to San Francisco when Elena was a young
girl. The came marriage and economic troubles caused by the Depression. When her husband, Lawrence, lost his job as an assistant
superintendent in the power department of Bethlehem Steel, Elena sought a way to help. She began by serving lunch in her
apartment. And the response was so great, she opened a restaurant in the King George Hotel in downtown San Francisco. Called 
Elena's Famous Mexican Restaurant, it was a great success bu kept Elena working 16 to 18 hours a day. She had been operated on for
a cateract and had suffered a detached retina. And in 1934, shortly before the birth of her second son, Bill, she went blind.
Despair, depression and helplessness followed until Elena realized that no one was about to cook and care for her family as she 
could. Without the aid of Braille implements, she learned how to measure ingredients, how to separate eggs...how to judge the
temprature of hot oil by its smell and how to measure cooking time by 15-minute radio intervals. In six months, Elena was again ahppy
and functioning. 'If you learn to be useful and keep busy, no handicap can hold you down,' she was once quoted as saying. Elena
spoke to high school and college groups and to many organizations. She gave cooking demonstrations and she taught cooking at the 
San Francisco Center for the Blind...Elena was name California Mother of the Year in 1963...Twenty-three years ago, Elena wnt into the 
fozen food business. Her son, Lawrence, is now president of the business which is called Elena's Food Specialties Inc. The firm
distributes frozen Mexican products to retail and institutional customers in Northern Calfiorina...Elena also served for about 10 years as a 
consultant to Lawry's Foods Inc. in the development of its Mexican products. Her last appearance in Los Angeles in this capacity was at
a Cinco de Mayo party held at Lawry's California Center in 1972."<br>

"Her philosophy will live on in her four cookbooks and other writings. The first book, 'Elena's Famous Mexican and Spanish Recipes,' was edited by a
group of San Francisco home economists and published in 1944. At least half a million copies have been sold...
Her second book, 'Elena's Fiesta Recipes,' was published by the Ward Ritchie Press in Los Angeles in 1952. 'Elena's Secrets of 
Mexican Cooking' appeared in 1958 with an introduction by the late Helen Evans Brown, an authority on Western cookery. Her last
cookbook, 'Elena's favorite Foods California Style,' with an introduction by James Beard, came out in 1967. Elena also wrote
 an inspirational book, 'Elena's Lessons in Living,' following a stay at a camp for blinded war veterans at the request of the
government."<br>

<b>Helen Evans Brown on Elena Zelayeta</b><br>
"Elena (everybody calls her that) is the gayest, dearest bundle of energy I have ever known. She is interested in everything
and everybody. Her eyes twinkle, as does her laugh. She moves quickly and surely in her kitchen, her tiny hands skillfully preparing the 
wonderful dishes for which she is so famous. To watch her work, to see her quick smile as she looks at you, to hear her merry
chuckle, you'd swear she had not a trouble in the world. Yet Elena is blind...First she learned to conquer fear. The kitchen was full
of terror--fire, sharp knives, hot fat, can openers. She had to learn all over again how to handle them."<br>
---<i>Elena's Secrets of Mexican Cooking</i>, Elena Zelayeta, introduction by Helen Evans Brown [Prentice Hall, Inc.:Englewood Cliffs 
NJ] 1958 (p. xv-xviii)
<p>
<b>James Beard's tribute</b><br>
"One is at a loss to
describe that quality, except to say that Elena combines unusual warmth with a striking creative instinct. Few people who meet
her fail to fall under her spell...Cuisine Zelayeta is distinctive as well as distinguished. It has imagination along with a
fine alance of flavor and texture. In a sense, Elena is a traditionalist, but she can also pull an inspired new combination
of foods out of the air--and make you feel it is the most authentic dish you ever ate...In shot, she has greatness."

<p>
<b>In Elena's own words</b><br>
"I hope that the readers of this book will be as happy in using it as I have been in writing it...I was aksed to do it because of the
growing interest in Mexican and Spanish food in this country. I hope that I have, in my small way, furthered that interest and that
this new book will multiply it. In it I want to accomplish three things: To those who know nothing of Mexican cuisine except what
they have heard--that it's always searingly not, exotically and overly spiced, and heavy--I hope to convince that it just isn't
so! And to those who know something, but not everything, about South-of-the-Border food, I hope to show that tamales and 
enchiladas, good as they are, are not the only dishes Mexican cooks know how to prepare. And I wish to convince everyone that
Mexican dishes may be served harmoniously with American ones, and that even one Mexican dish can do much to add interest to what 
might otherwise be a very dull meal...The dishes of Mexico, as well as the methods or preparing them and the names by which they are
known, vary from state to state, from region to region. And to make it even more confusing, some Mexican dishes common in the
Southwestern part of the United States, are little known in Mexico, and others, though known, bear different names. Thus you may not always find the
recipe you want under the name by which you know it...I have tried, wherever possible, to give both names, or at least an accurate
enough description so that you will recognize it...As for me, I have been an American for many years...my mother was a 
wonderful cook, one who knew food well and had a genius for bringing out the best in every dish. It was from her that I learned
Spanish cooking. The Mexican cooks who worked at the inn taught me how to prepare their dishes. We came to San Francisco when I 
was a young girl, and because I...loved to cook, I soon learned how to do it in the manner of my new countrymen...Because
of m many years in this country, I have learned what Americans like to eat. These recipes have been adapted to suit the palates of my
American friends and my American sons."<br>

"I love to cook. It's a way I can be creative withhout sight. I can't paint and have no talent for music, but give me a full
refrigerator and my pots and pans, and I'm happy as an artist with a new canvas and palette. I raterh regret the great use of 
convenience foods these days--though I shouldn't, for I make a living selling frozen Mexican foods! But it's spoiled some of the most pleasant
parts of homemaking for women. I hope the day never arrives when all food comes ready to pop into the oven."<br>

It's always hard for met to choose my favorite dishes, because I love food--a food--and whatever I'm eating at the moment

favorites, though we have a choice of excellent varieties of lettuce, all good. I often combine two or more. The dressing I use most
often is simply olive oil and wine vinegar, a touch of garlic and plenty of salt and pepper. But I like a few extras. Sometimes it's
a sprinkling of crab, shrimp or lobster; another time it's slices of hard-cooked egg. Or some tomato or cucumber, or thin rounds
of radish. Or a diced avocado. Or orange or grapefruit sections, or halves of crisp Todays. A topping of crisp pork cracklings is
also interesting and delicious. So you see, my favorite salad is basic greens, but the costume jewelry gives it a different
look from day to day." (p. 49)<br>

<p>Food historians generally agree avocados originated in Central America. There is
much debate regarding the exact origin and subsequent dispersion of this fruit. Notes here:
<p>
"The avocado (Persia americana) apparently originated in Central America, where it was
cultivated as many as 7,000 years ago. It was grown some 5,000 years ago in Mexico and, but the
time of Christopher Columbus, had become a food as far south as Peru, where it is called palta.
Legend has it that Hernando Cortes found avocados flourishing around what is now Mexico City
in 1519. The English word "avocado" is derived from the Aztec ahuacatl, which the Spaniards
passed along transliterated as aguacate."<br>
---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i>, Kenneth F. Kiple & Kriemhild Conee Ornelas
[Cambridge University Press:Cambridge] 2000, Volume Two (p. 1725)
<p>
"The avocado tree, a member of the laurel family, is native to subtropical America, where it has
been cultivated for over 7,000 years, as archaeological remains demonstrate. There are three
original races of species. The Mexican type, which was called by the Aztecs ahuacatl...The
Guatemalan type...and the West Indian type." <br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
43)
<p>

"We are also told that the avocado is a native of Peru...this is an error...caused because it was in
Peru that the Spaniards found it first. But Pizarro entered Peru only in 1527, while th avocado had
already been described in 1519 in the <i>Suma de geografia</i> of Margin Fernandex de Encisco,
who discovered it near what is now Santa Marta, Colombia. We are told too that avocados were
first cultivated in Peru during what is called the 'Formative Period' of Peruvian agriculture, which
runs from 650AD to the beginning of our era...however, Garcilaco di la Vega...wrote more
plausible that it was brought from Ecuador into the warm valleys near Cuzco by the Inca Tupac
Yupanqui, who reigned in the fifteenth century AD..." <br>

---<i>Food</i>, Waverly Root, [Smithmark:New York] 1980 (p.17-18) 
<p>
<i>Foods America Gave the World</i>, (A Hyatt Verrill, page 168) concludes "We have the
ancient
pre-Incan races of Peru, the Mayas of Yucatan and Guatemala and the Aztecs of Mexico to thank
for having given us this splendid fruit...Whether the pre-Incans, the Mayas or Aztecs were the first
to see the possibilities in the development of the aguacate [avocado] will probably never be
known, for the fruits are depicted on pottery and sculptures of all these immeasurably ancient
races."
<p>
"The small, nearly spherical seeds of wild avocados are found in archaeolgical sites in Oazaca and
the Tehucan valley of Mexico at dates of 8000 to 7000 B.C. They are seeds of the cold and
drought-toleratant upland avocado...tree...By 6000 to 5000 B.C. they were being cultivated in
Tehuacan, as shown by the increasing size of the fruit and the change in seed shape from the
round wild type to egg-shaped. The two other races are the Guatemalan...and the misnamed West
Indian race, which was not found in the West Indies until after the arrival of the Europeans."<br>
---<i>America's First Cuisines</i>, Sophie D. Coe [University of Texas Press:Austin] 1994 (p.
44-5)
<p>
Notes regarding regional dispersion are chronicled here:<br>
"One of the first Europeans to taste the avocado was Fernando de Oviedo, who noticed its
external resemblance to a dessert pear, so ate it with cheese; but other Spaniards preferred to add
sugar, or salt and pepper...The same applies to the first mention in English, in 1672, by W.
Hughes, a royal physician, after a visit to Jamaica...However, despite such favourable comments,
the avocado was slow to spread from its native region. For Europeans, it remained for a long time
no more than a tropical curiosity; and commercial cultivation in N. America only began in
California in the 1870s and in Florida from about 1900."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i> (p. 43)
<p>
"The Spaniards ate avocados with sugar, salt, or both, and introduced them into other parts of the
Americas as well as other tropical parts of the world. But until the end of World War II, avocados
were virtually unknown in Europe."<br>
---<i>Cambridge World History of Food</i> (p. 1725)
<p>
"The avocado, which originated in Mexico, Guatemala, or South America...its cultivation spread
slowly from the New World to the Old, but in recent times it has been grown in nearly all
countries where the climate was suitable. Among these may be mentioned India, where it has been
cultivated cince 1860, the South Sea Islands, and the countries bordering the Mediterranean
Sea."<br>
---<i>Food Products from Afar</i>, E.H.S. Bailey and Herbert S. Bailey [The Century Co.:New
York] 1922 (p. 213-4)


<p>
There is also some controversy as to where (in the United States) avocados were first grown for
commercial purposes.  Waverly Root states "I have no reason for doubting the report that a
horticulturist named Henry Perrine first planted avocados in Florida in 1833, but avocado culture
did not get un way on a commercial scale in the United States until about 1900, when Florida fruit
growers became interested in its possibilities."(<i>Food</i>, page 18). <i>Eating in America: A
History</i>,
(Waverly Root & Richard de Rochemont, page 297) adds: The first person known to have taken
it [avocado] seriously was a horticulturist named George B. Cellon, who, circa 1900, learned by
experimentation that grafted trees could be induced to perpetuate superior strains of this fruit in
Florida...The tree grew well on the slightly sandy soils of Florida, and an avocado industry was
launched in that state, an example followed shortly afterwards by California."
<p>
This claim is disputed by the California Avocado Commission, which dates their industry
beginning in the 1870s.  Davidson also cites this information, "Commercial cultivation on N.
America only began in California in the 1870s and in Florida from about 1900." (<i>Oxford</i>,
page 43). "This fruit was introduced into California at Santa Barbara in 1870, and since that time
many orchards of from five to ten acres have been planted," confirms <i>Food Products from
Afar</i>, Bailey & Bailey (p. 215).
<p>
<a NAME="#guacamole">
<b>What is Guacamole?</b><br>
This <a href="foodmexican.html#avodaos">avocado</a> based salsa is a gift from Ancient Aztec culinary traditions.
<p>
"There is good reason for the popularity of the avocado. The diet of
pre-Columbian America was what we would consider low fat. The avocado is one of three fruits
that
contain large amounts of oil in their flesh...In addition to fat, avocados also contain two or three
times as much protein as other fruits, and many vitamins as well. We know little about how
avocados, or paltas, as they are called in Peru, were eaten in pre-Columbian America. The one
recipe that we may be sure of is the Aztec ahuaca-hulli, or avocado sauce, familiar to all of us
today as guacamole. This combination of mashed avocados, with or without a few chopped

The word <i>guacamole</i> comes from the Nahuatl words <i>ahuacatle</i> (avocado) and <i>molli</i> (a mixture, or concoction). In Mexico it is often
eaten at the beginning of the meal with warm tortillas--and that is how one can really savor it--or with <i>tacos</i>, and sour cream, rice and 
<i>chicarron</i>. <br>

2 sprigs fresh coriander<br>
1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste<br>

1/4 onion, finely chopped<br>
2 sprigs fresh coriander, finely chopped<br>

Cut the avocado in half. Remove the seed and scoop out the flesh. Mash the flesh roughly with the chili paste in the molcajte. Skin, seed and chop the
tomato (page 43) and add it, with the chopped onion and coriander, to the guacamole. Mix well and serve immediately.<br>
This is such a beautiful concoction, pale green flecked with the red of the tomato pieces and the darker green of the coriander, and a delight aesthetically if
served in a molcajete, where it rightfully belongs. It is so delicate it is best eaten the moment it is made There are many suggestions about keeping it--leave
the pit in, adding a little lime juice, not adding the salt until the last, putting it in an airtight container. They all hep a litte, but in no time at all
that delicate green has aged. There are many variations--making it with tomataes verdes, or leaving out the tomato altogether, mashing the avocado with just a 
little chili and salt and a suspicion of lime juice. Practically anything goes, but within certain limits, which does not include the unnecessary additions that I see
in most pedestrian cookbooks."<br>

<b>Maize</b><br>
"It is usually accepted that maize was growing in Meosamerica by between 8000 and 5000 B.C. Reliable archaeolgical evidence of
domesticated maize dates from as long ago as 3600 B.C. in what is now central Mexico, and it is thought that domestication of the 
crop first took place--doubtless at a much earlier date--in this general area. To the south, a separate domestication of maize may
have been accomplished at about the same time by South American Indians in the central Andes, or the crop may simply have traveled
to that area from its point of origin. To the north, however, there seems to be no doubt that domesticated maize arrived much later, with 
locally adapted varieties appearing in the Eastern Woodlands of North America around A.D. 200 and in the central portion of the
continent by about A.D. 600. Indigenous American societies intensively cultivated maize, and it became a principal staple of the 
Aztecs, the Inca, the Maya, and many groups of North American Indians--especially those in what is now the southeastern United
States--for several centuries before the arrival of Europeans. All parts of the plant were used for food and other purposes; the
Inca even made maize "beers," known collectively as chica...Christopher Columbus carried maize to Spain, where by 1500 or so
it was under cultivation. Before many years had passed, maize was being grown throughout the Iberian and Italian peninsula and had
appeared as a garden vegetable in England and central Europe...By the seventeenth century, maize had become an important European
field crop and staple food, especially in those areas that now comprise northern Italy, Romania, Slovenia, Serbia, and Bulgaria, in 
addition to Spain...As the new crop spread across Europe, its New World origins were largely forgotten, but in each locality
people at least knew that it came from somewhere else..."Corn" was a generic word meaning simply "grain" in a number of European
languages, so that its many aliases acutally identified maize as "foreign grain," and the American usage of "corn" for maize
grows out of such terminology--in this case, "corn" is the shortened version of the English term "Indian corn," by which the colonists
meant, of course, "Indian grain," or maize. During the sixteenth century, Portuguese traders carried the plant to East
Africa and Asia, whereas Arab merchants were probably responsible for its introduction to North Africa...The crop spread rapidly
throughout the African continent...In Asia, maize spread along trade routes from the Indian subcontinent, reaching points in 
China and Southeast Asia by the mid-sixteenth century, and during the eighteenth it was much expanded as a crop in China. From there,
it spread to Korea and Japan."<br>

<b>Maya & maize</b><br>
"The Maya creation legend in the Popul Vuh, describes how man was made from corn. Corn is the most important ingredient in any of the agricultural offerings to the 
deities and plays a crucial part in the daily diet of the village Maya. The average adult consumes at least to kils of corn each day--more than four pounds. Every part of the 
plant is put to use. The husk is utilized as the wrappings for tamales and cigarettes. It also serves as a dish or pot scourer and is used to remove stains from laundry. 
Husks may serve a s afilling for stuffing pillows or other soft objects and even provide a medicinal tea. The stigmas from the maize plant serve as a diuretic. Bakal, the 
cob, is used as fuel for fires, bottle stoppers and toilet paper. Ground and mixed with honey dregs, the cob becomes forage for the animals. The leaves, green stalks and 
roots serve as fertilizer. A few Maya still remember how to use their maize kernels to divine the future. This method of foretelling the future is called xixte and means 'to 
separate the good from the bad.' Xixte was at one time a principal method used by the xmen to determine the outcome of an illness. To ascertain a prognosis, a portion of
 grains is singled out from a container and arranged in piles of four. A favourable outcome for the problem at hand can be predicted if the piles of four are even in number 
and the remaining pile of kernels is also even.  If both of the piles are split, one even and one uneven, then the outcome of the event is difficult to ascertain. There is 
another method of using maize to predict the course of an illness. When corn kernels are dropped into a bowl of atole or Saka, floating kernels indicate a favorable 
prognosis. When corn sinks to the bottom of the bowl, the outcome of the situation appears grim. Ix K'anle'ox, the goddess of corn and mother of all the gods, is 
associated with the color yellow and the cardinal direction, South."<br>

"Maize gods native to Central and South America were far more ancient than Christian saints...For these Maya descendents, the association of maize with blood is as old
 as the oldest Maya memory, as old as the first planted seed. As their culture evolved, ancient Maya feritlized seeds of corn with the sacrificed blood of their enemies and 
the blood of their own kings. For the Maya a single kernel of corn is symbolic of what Christians smubolize as the holy cross-the tragic and monstrous truth that the seed
 of life is death. Today, in the Maya ruins of Palenque in the Yucatan jungle, the Temple of the Foliated Cross reveals in its carvings what Christians call the Tree of Life. 
For the Maya, it is the World Tree in the shape of a cross, where the crosspiece or branches are formed by leaves and silk-topped ears of corn, each ear a human head. 
The corn sprouts from a trunk of blood rooted in the head of the Water-Lily Monster that floats on the primal waters of the Underworld. Here out of the monster's mouth a 
god is born--God K, the Young Lord, the Maize God...So subtle and complex is the ancient Maya language of corn, carved in stone, painted on walls and pottery and 
screen-folds made of beaten bark, that only in recent years have its mysteries begun to be decoded. We now see that the Maya maize God, like the medieval Christian 
God, stands at the center of a cluster of images and symbols that evolved slowly but took primary shape in the third to ninth centuries after Christ, a period rich in 
Christian saints and Maya maize gods. Rich also in Maya script which recorded the history and destiny of a people...Maya hieroglyphs, once we can read them, may help
 us learn what 'discovery,' 'growth' and 'begining' meant to a civilization built on the symbolic as well as the physical potency of maize...The life cycle of maize was the
 great metaphor of Maya life, the root of its language, its rituals and its calendar. We now see that the many configurations of the Maize God evolved from the seed of life 
embodied in the Kan sign. Kan is only one of the twenty named days of the Maya calendar, but wherever the kan sign appears in conjunction with a god, it refers to crops
 and the powers for good and evil that affect them. Kan is also the syllable wah, which denotes bread, tortilla, tamale. Bowls holding Kan sins may represent offerings of
 maize, and therefore blood offerings and other precious things..."<br>

<b>Mexican casserole</b><br>
The dishes we Americans enjoy today as "Mexican Casserole" (aka "Mexican Lasagne") are hybrid culinary creations
featuring Old and New world traditions. Recipes are all over the map. Combinations of native Central
American ingredients baked casserole style were documented in the 16th century. Contemporary USA interpretations resemble 
Italian lasagna: substituting tortillas for pasta, salsa for tomato sauce, beans/ground meat/chilies for 
protein/flavor/color. Dairy component varies from Spanish to German to TexMex to Southern California to processed 
American cheddar.
<p>
16th century Spanish settlers tell us they witnessed wealthy Ancient Aztec diners consuming 
<a href="foodfaq.html#casseroles">casseroles</a>. Then, as today, ingredients varied. Father Bernadino Sahagan
listed several casseroles consumed by Aztecs in Montezuma's court.  
When reading these early accounts, we must remember European chroniclers used words from their native language to 
describe "foreign" dishes. They also do not share how these dishes were crafted, method (time/temperature) or final presentation.
<p>
"The lords also ate many kinds of casseroles;...one kind of casserole of fowl made in their fashion, with red chile and with tomatoes, and ground squash seeds, a 
dish which is now called pipian; they ate another casserole of fowl made with yellow chile. They ate many kinds of casseroles, and they ate roast birds...They also
 ate fish in casseroles: one of white fish made with yellow chile and tomatoes, and with ground squash seeds which is very good to eat. They eat another kind of 
casserole made of frogs and green chile; another kind of casserole of those fish which they call axolotl with yellow chile; they also ate another kind of tadpoles with 
chiltexpitl. They also ate another casserole of large-winged ants with chiltexpitl. Also another casserole of locusts, and it is very tasty food; they also ate maguey
 works, with chiltextpitl molli [sauce]; also another casserole of shrimps made with chiltecpitl and tomatoes, and some ground squash seeds. Also another casserole
 of the kind of fish which they call topotli, made with chiltecpitl as the above said. Another casserole they ate was of large fish, made as above...they ate another 
casserole made of unripe plums [Spondias spp.], with some little white fish, yellow chile, and tomatoes. (Sahagun 1982: 463-463)."<br>

"Casseroles. There is an assortment of Mexican budines (puddings), sopas secas ('dry soups' or pastas), taquitos al horno (baked tacos), and chilaquiles, which
 have one thing in common--they are all cooked the same way. All are tortilla dishes--tortillas filled and rolled, cut into strips, fried, and baked in layers with sauces, 
cheese, and meat or vegetable fillings. They are all rather concentrated, some of them rather rich. Some could be served with just a salad, a meal in themselves, 
while others would make a good accompaniment to plainly cooked meats, poultry or fish."<br>

<p>
"The word chilaquiles comes from chil-a-quiltitl, meaning 'herbs or greens in chili broth'--colloquially, 'a broken-up old sombrero.' It is, in fact, one of the many 
recipes devised to use up stale tortillas. The purists say that the tortillas must be torn up into large pieces, but the dish is easier to serve and eat if smaller. Like so
 many other recipes in Mexico, every cook has her own way of preparing them."<br>

some variations are not.  Mole poblano de
guajolote(turkey in mole poblano), combining chocolate with chili, is a classic example. Despite the rumors, this is not
an ancient Aztec dish. The 
Aztecs used chocolate for religious ceremonies and medicinal purposes. They did not <a href="foodmaya.html#hotchocolate">

"The idea of using chocolate as a flavoring in cook food would have been horrifying to the Aztecs--just as Christians could not conceive of using communion wine to
 make, say, coq au vin. In all of the pages of Sahagun that deal with Aztec cuisine and with chocolate, there is not a hint that it ever entered into an Aztec dish.
  Yet
 today many food writers and gourmets consider one particular dish, the famous pavo or mole poblano, which contains chocolate , to represent the pinnacle of 
Mexican cooking tradition...[mole poblano] has no Aztec foundations...regardless of what food writers may say. Its true, creolized and Hispanicized nature is given 
away by...the list of ingredients from an authentic recipe...Ten of the 19 ingredients are Old World." <br>

"Mole poblano de guajolote...or Pabo in mole poblano...is a dish of some antiquity and has
achieved some
fame for the inclusion of bitter chocolate in the sauce, although the quantity is small and the effect
not
separably discernable. Some have thought that the dish was made, with chocolate already added,
in
pre-Columbian times, but the lack of evidence for pre-Columbian use of chocolate as an
ingredient in any
food dish tells against this conclusively; and indeed the attitude of the Aztecs to chocolate was
such that
they would have been no more likely to use it in cooking than Spaniards would have been to cook
with
communion wine. Quite apart from this particular question, it is doubtful whether mole poblano
dates as far
back as the 17th century, as has been generally believed." <br>

"The wild turkey or guajalote is indigenious to Mexico and the New World. For centuries before
the
Spaniards arrived, the nobility ate roasted turkey, quail, and casseroles of turkey prepared with
chilies,
tomatoes and ground pumpkin seeds. The turkey is still one of the most important foods in
Yucatan....No
special festival is compelte without mole poblano de guajolote. It is prepared with loving care,
and even
today, more often than not, it is the one dish that brinds out the metate: chilies, spices, nuts,
seeds, and
tortillas are all ground on it...It would be impossible to say just how many versions there are;
every cook
from the smallest hamlet to the grandest city home has her own specials touch--a vew more
mulatos here,
less anchos, or a touch of chipotle cooke with the turkey; some insist on onion, others won't
tolerate it. Many
cooks in Puebla itself insist on toasting the chilies, often mulatos only, over an open fire and
grinding them
dry...The world mole comes from the Nahuatl word molli, meaning "concoction." The majority of
people
respond, when mole is mentioned, with "Oh yes, I know-that chocolate sauce. I wouldn't like it."
Well, it isn't
a chocolate sauce. One little piece of chocolate (and in Mexico we used to grind toasted cacao
beans for
the mole) goes into a large casserole full of rich dark-brown and russett chiles...
There are many stories attached to its beginnings but they all agree that the mole was born in one
of the
convents in the city of Puebla de los Angeles. The most repeated version...it that Sr Andrea, sister
superior
of the Santa Rosa Convent, wished to honor the Archbishop for having a convent especially
constructed for
her order; trying to blend the ingredients of the New World with those of the old, she created
mole poblano.
Yet another story goes that the Viceroy, Don Juan de Palafox y Mendoza, was visiting Puebla.
This time it
was Fray Pascual who was preparing the banquet at the convent where he was going to eat.
Turkeys were
cooking in cazuelas on the fire; as Fray Pascual, scolding his assistants for their untidiness,
gathered up all
the spices they had been using, and putting them together onto a tray, a sudden gust of wind
swept across
the kitchen and they spilled over the cazauelas."<br>

Nachos, as we know them today, descend from traditional Central American
culinary traditions. <a href="foodmexican.html#tortillas">Tortillas</a>, versatile and cheap, provided the base for daily meals in endless combinations.
What makes Nachos different? It has an inventor: Ignacio "Nacho" Anaya and a specific creation story. In sum:
The year? 1943. The place? Piedra Negra. For whom? ladies who lunch. We're not here to judge.
Based on our survey of historic sources, we choose to celebrate the story and the honor the man. We're also asking for your
help with obtaining the <a href="foodmexican.html#nachorecipe">original recipe</a>.
<p>
The "original account" is generally adheres to contemporary legend, except: it provides an earlier date (1940), a different name for the restaurant
(Victory Club), another job title for the inventor (executive chef) and an alternative spelling of the inventor's name (Amaya). Presumably, 
over time, the story was corrected.

<b>[1954: The original account]</b><br>
"One afternoon in 1940, four Eagle Pass ladies walked into the Victory Club dining room looking for something new in cocktail hour snacks. Always ready to help, and to 
try his hand at anything were seated at their table by smiling, friendly Ignacio (Nacho)
 Amaya. Their request went something like this: 'Nacho, we're tired of the usual type snacks with our drinks. Do you think you could whip up something new? Something
different?' Always ready to help--and to try his hand at anything--'Nacho' Amaya smiled and told the ladies he would see what could be done. 
'Honestly,' he admitted to us recently over a bottle of cold Bohemia, 'I didn't have the least idea what I was going to try. But I went into the kitchen, looked around and started groping for an
idea. I saw a bowl of freshly fried pieces of tortilla; then I figured some grated cheese on them might be all right. Well, I got the cheese and began sprinkling the tortilla 
pieces with it. About this time, I got the idea to put some jalapeno strips atop the cheese. I got the japlapeno; l and as I finished putting the strips on the cheese, I decdied it would be a good
idea to put the whole thing into the oven to melt the cheese.' 'Nacho' Amaya was a bit timorous when he set is concoction on the table before the ladies from 
Eagle Pass. He muttered something about hoping they liked it and swiftly sought and exit. Before he could hide, however, the ladies were clamoring for him. 
'Make us some more of those wonderful snacks,' they demanded. Whenb 'Nacho brought out the second batch, one of the ladies asked: 'What do you call these 
snacks?' 'Well,' stammered Amaya, 'I guess we can just call them 'Nacho's Special.' He figured he never would hear of the concoction again. He was
wrong. Next day, when he came to work, waiters at the Victor Club asked 'How in the heck do you make 'Nacho's Specials?' We had calls for them last 
night but didn't know what they were!' No sooner had he pased on the secret than Gaspar Slaazar, a club waiter, got a call for the 'nachos.' It's been that way all
up and down the border now for 14 years. Fame of the delicious 'nachos' has spread from the bouth of the Rio Grande to Jurarez. The 'nacho's' fans have carried the reicpe up and down the Rio and into 
Mexico...Other spots along the gorder have claimed the 'Nacho's' as a native article, but Ignacio
Amaya says, definately, he 'discovered' them here. The 'Nacho's' inventor is a native of Chihauhua; has lived in Piedras Negras 18 years. He lived in 
Texas several years, working for the San Antonio Standard-Times. In 1929-1930 he worked at Mrs. Crosby's famous restaurant in Acuna, across from Del
Rio; then went to Cafe Apolo in Torreon. For the past 16 years, he's been with the Victory Club where. today, he is 'jefe de cocina'--a title we know as
'executive chef.' As 'Jefe de cocina,' however, 'Nacho' Amaya's duties today also include greeting and chatting with his hundreds of amigos from both sides of the 
Rio Grande; and to make sure they are comfortable, getting good service, and having a good time."<br>

<p>
<b>[1969: updated story reveals additional details about the man behind the invention] </b><br>
"It's been almost 30 years since Ignacio (Nacho) Anaya whipped up his first 'Nachos Especials,' and he has yet to realize a single penny from his 
invention of the popular appetizer known from Texas to Saudi Arabia. 'The only man who's making money on Nachos (as they are 
popularly known) is the man who's selling cheese and jalepnos,' Anaya smiles and says. At 74, the diminutive Anaya could pass for a 
man little more than half his age, despite the fact he has been waiting tables since 1918. Born in 1895 in Chihauhua, Mexico, 
Anaya was raised by a foster mother after his parents died 'when I was real young.' It as in his younger days that Anaya began to get the 
idea for his Nachos. 'This woman who raised me used to feed me quesadilas,' Anaya said, then when time to explain that quesadilas are folded 
tortillas with melted cheese inside. With this in his mind, the stage is set for mid 1943 when Anaya was a waiter at the old Moderno 
Restaurant which has since been torn down and replaced with a swank, new Moderno. 'There four ladies were sitting at a table 
drinking chicos then relates how they asked for some fried tortillas after about four rounds of drinks. 'Well, since no one was in the 
kitchen for about an hour, I went in, sliced a tortilla in four pieces, put some cheese and a slice of jalapeno on top and stuck it in the 
oven for a few minutes,' Anaya said. After being served the new treat, the women commented on how tasty they were and asked 'What do 
you call them?' On the spur of the moment, Anaya replied, 'Just call them Nacho's Especial,' and one of the world's top appetizers was born. 
Since then, the apostrophe has long been dropped form the word 'Nacho's' on menus, depriving Anaya of even that bit of possessive fame. 
Today, many restaurants have the simple listing, 'nachos,' on their menu, although admittedly, there are several variations. Some cooks add a 
bit of lettuce and tomato salad, transferring Nachos into miniature taco-like creations, while others begin with a base of refried 
beans. But, a true Nacho today is as it as in the beginning...a tortilla quarter, Wisconsin cheese and a sliver of jalapeno pepper. 
Once, a lawyer friend offered to take Anaya to San Antonio to silent a patent on his creation, but Anaya refused. 'I didn't' go with him or 
want to do it,' Anaya explained, 'I thought it would be too much trouble, but of course then I didn't know how popular they were going to 
become.' Spread of the creation has been mostly by world-of-mouth, Anaya explains. After someone would eat a platter of Nachos in the old Moderno or 
old Victory Club, where Anaya worked until 1961, he would pass the simple recipe on in restaurants where he lived or traveled. 'Now," Anaya 
says, 'They've got them as far away as Chicago and Saudi Arabia. 'And,' he says,' It's been the biggest boost for the jalapeno 
business there ever was...at the Morderno they used to use maybe one gallon of jalpenos per week, now they use six or seven cases 
(six gallons per case) per week...Since Nov. 18, 1961, he has operated Nacho's Restaurant two miles from Eagle Pass-Piedras Negras International 
Bridge...And, while Anaya admits that it hasn't been particularly profitable, he says it beats waiting tables at the equivalent of about 
70 cents per day plus tips which was the going rate when he began at the old Moderna...despite the hardships, Anaya and his wife 
(who died of cancer in 1964) raised nine children...and one son now works as a waiter at the new Moderna carrying on the Anaya 
tradition...Even though, as Anaya says, 'It's too late to make the millions...maybe not millions...but a lot of money...I might once have 
made,' he still smiles about it. 'If you'll just send me a bunch of customers, 'I'll be happy, he remarked as he set down a 
platter of sizzling 'Nachos Especial.'" <br>

"Some rise to greatness. Some have greatness thrust upon them. For Ignacio Anaya, greatness came with cheese and jalapenos. For out of necessity 
and the desire to please, Anaya invented the nacho. In a border town restaurant in 1943. His son said so. So does the government tourism 
office in the Mexican state of Coahuilua. By formal decree, Saturday was International Day of the nacho and a bronze plaque was installed in 
Anaya's honor. Then, the First Annual Nacho Cook-Off was held in Piedras Negras' main plaza. Over the years, the singular 
combination of fried corn chips, cheese and jalapenos has blossomed into a culinary staple in the United States. it...But the details of how it 
all started have been shrouded in time. For some of us, anyway. 'My father invented the nacho in 1943,' said Ignacio Anaya Jr., a retired banker in the 
cross-border town of Eagle Pass...It was the senior Anaya, maitre d' at El Moderno, had welcomed a group of U.S. Army officers' wives from Eagle 
Pass at the restaurant, the younger Anaya said. They wanted some 'hotanas' or snacks. Anaya rummaged in the kitchen, grabbed some tostadas 
(fried corn chips), shredded some cheese and heated them in the oven, topping each chip with a slice jalapeno...they were...a hit...'By the time 
my father returned with a second platter, the ladies had named the dish 'Nacho's Special,' Anaya said. 'That is the Spanish 
nickname for Ignacio.'...'I am very proud of the recognition being paid my father...it was not something he did for fame, but simply to serve his 
guests.'...David Garcia, vice president of B. Martinez and Sons. in San Antonio doesn't want to rain on Anaya's parade. But he finds the concept of 
inventing the nacho a little hard to swallow. 'I've heard this story before, about the nacho being invented in Piedras Negras. But in my opinion, 
this is just a very old custom along the border, melting cheese on fried tortilla chils...It's like saying someone invented the fajita. 
It's just something people have been doing all their lives.' Garcia brings a certain historical perspective to his opinions. his firm has been 
making tortillas, tamales and other Mexican food products in San Antonio since 1895...Like the invention of the margarita, the convergence of the 
nacho as a cultural icon is typical of folkloric events, said Dr. Jay Ann Cozz, a writer and authority on food and folklore in Austin. 
'The actual event of creation was an isolated event. The producer was just trying to please customers...but the cultural importance is attached later, 
usually by a consumer who is searching for cultural authenticity, the real thing.'...Bob Guildry recalls eating 
something similar to the nacho as a boy growing up in El Paso during World War II. Except it was a corn tortilla, fried 
whole, and covered with cheese and peppers. And it's called a quesadilla....Guidry...doesn't remember seeing the more bite-size nacho until he
 returned to El Paso in the 1950s...'Maybe this guy in Piendras Negras came up with the idea of cutting the chips into smaller pieces...That's
 pretty imaginative. But it doesn't really matter. Nachos are popular because they taste good. not because where they were invented.' In Piedras 
Negras, they might argue that point. Especially at Restaurant El Moderno, which sits where it has since 1936, just across from the central market,
 only a few bolcks from the International Bridge...[the] chief bartender and impromptu historian, confirms that this is the birthplace of the nacho....
Back in Eagle Pass, the inventor's son recalls how he and his brothers sought to patent the nacho in the early 1960s, but learned that the dish
 had already fallen into the public domain. 'It did not bother my father. He opened his own restaurant in Piendras Negras and worked there until he 
died in 1975 at age 81.'" <br>

<b>[2006: contemporary reconciliation] </b><br>
"According to nacho lore, it all began in 1943, when several military wives at Fort Duncan in Eagle Pass, Texas, decided to go on a toot in Mexico. This did not require much pluck. Eagle Pass is just a short bridge over the Rio Grande from Piedras Negras in the state of Coahuila. In Piedras Negras (black stones, from the coal once mined there), they took shelter in the Victory Club, demanding food as well as drink. The only employee present, the maitre d', grabbed some fried corn tortilla chips from the bar, melted Wisconsin yellow cheese on top of them and then set a slice of canned jalapeno peppers on each snack. 
This Escoffier of la frontera was Ignacio Anaya, nicknamed Nacho. The Army brides gobbled his improvisation up and spread the word about the dish their leader Mamie had dubbed Nacho's especiales. Eventually people all over southern Texas were calling them nachos. 
The evidence for this tale is less solid than what we might demand to prove that, say, George Washington threw a silver dollar across the Potomac. The most 
convincing account comes from Ignacio Anaya Jr., not a disinterested party, in an interview in the San Antonio Express-News in 2002. Long before then, the 
Victory Club restaurant had closed and Nacho Sr. had moved to the Moderno." <br>

<a name="quesadillas">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Quesadillas</b></font><br>
The origins of traditional foods such as quesadillas cannot usually be traced to a particular year
or person. They are foods that evolved because the ingredients and technology needed to cook
them were readily available. The history of quesadillas begins with the story of corn and the
cooking of tortillas:
<p>
"Tortilla...a round, thin unleavened bread made from ground maize, a basic food of Mesoamerica.
It is not known how many millennia this has been a staple; but when the conquistadores arrived in
the New World in the late 15th century, they discovered that the inhabitants made flat corn
breads. The native Nahuatl name for these was tlaxcalli and the Spanish gave them the name
tortilla...The art of tortilla-making was highly developed by the native Mesoamericans; 17th
century Spanish observed, Francisco Hernandez, remarked on the fine, almost transparent tortillas
prepared for important people....Fresh tortillas are eaten as bread, used as plate and spoon, or
filled to make composite dishes such as tacos and enchiladas....A quesadilla is a 'turnover' made by
folding a fresh tortilla in half around a simple filling such as cheese, epazote (a pungent herb), and
pepper, or potatoes and chorizo, and deep frying it..."<br>
---<i>The Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson (p. 803)
<p>
"Queso...the Spanish word for 'cheese', forms part of some names of cheese of Spain and Latin
America."<br>
---<i>The Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson (p. 644)
<p>
"Quesadillas are one of the Mexicans' favorite simple snacks. They are, in fact, uncooked tortillas
stuffed with one of various fillings and folded over to make a "turnover." They are then toasted
on a hot griddle or fried until golden. In many parts of Mexico they are filled with strips of
Chihuahua cheese, which melts and "strings" nicely--a Mexican requirement...the farther south
one goes the more complicated they become. For instance, in central Mexico the simplest ones are
filled with some of the braided Oaxaca cheese, a few fresh leaves of epazote and strips of peeled
chile poblano. Potato and chorizo filling--that used for tacos...--is also a favorite version, while
the most highly esteemed of all are those of sauteed squash blossoms (flor de calabaza) or the
ambrosial fungus that grows on the corn blossoms (huitlachoche), both of which are at their best
during the rainy months of summer and early fall."<br>
--<i>The Tortilla Book</i>, Diana Kennedy [Harper & Row:New York] 1975 -(p. 106)
<p>
As such, quesadillas are a blend of Old World tradition and New World foods. Recipes for
turnover-type foods (aka portable filled pastries, both sweet and savory) were popular fare in
Medieval Spain. About <a href="foodpies.html#portable">portable pies</a>. <a
href="foodmeats.html#chicken">Chicken</a> (chicken quesadillas) is also an Old World food,
introduced to Mexico by the Spanish settlers in the 16th century. New World fowl included
turkey, strikingly similar in flavor and composition. The turkey, however, was not used for simple
snacks. It was saved for special holidays. Cheese (queso/quesa) is also an Old World food.

<blockquote>
<b>[1944]<br>
"Quesadilla (Tortilla Stuffed with Cheese)</b><br>
Take fresh tortillas (bought in a Mexican store), place generous piece of Monterey cream cheese (or American cheese) in the
center, and fold it over as you would a turnover. Pin top with toothpicks to hold. Place in hot, ungreased skillet and cook
lightly, turing often until cheese is melted. Delicious with refried beans."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Refried beans</b></font><br>
Although food historians generally agree that new world beans played an important culinary role
dating back to ancient times, the history behind refried beans seems to be a modern matter of
semantic confusion.
<p>

"Refried beans. A Mexican-American dish of mashed cooked pinto beans, usually served as a side
dish or as a filling for various 
 preparations. The term "refried" is actually a mistranslation
from the Mexican "frijoles refritos," which means "well-fried beans," a distinction first mentioned
in Erna Fergusson's Mexican Cookbook (1934), but "refried" has remained in common parlance
with regard to this dish."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman] 1999
(p. 268)
<p>
"Refried beans is the misleading translation of a term very familiar in Spanish-speaking countries
of Central and South America; frijoles refritos. This refers to beans which have first been cooked
in water and are subsequenty fried. There is no question of their being fried twice, i.e. literally
refried. Diana Kennedy (1986) has explained the matter: "Several people have asked me why,
when the beans are fried, they are called refried. Nobody I asked in Mexico seemed to know until
quite suddenly it dawned on me. The Mexicans have a habit a qualifying a word to emphasize the
meaning by adding the prefix re-. They will get the oil very hot (requemar), or something will be
very good (retebien). Thus refrito beans are well fried, which they certainly are, since they are
fried until they are almost dry.""<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
657)
<p>
"During all my years of living in Mexico and teaching Mexican cooking in New York, I (like
everyone else) have thought of frijoles refritos as refried beans. Several  people  have asked me
why, when the beans are fried, they are called refried. Nobody I asked in Mexico seemed to know
until quite suddenly it dawned on me. The Mexicans have a habit of qualifying a word to
emphasize the meaning by adding the prefix re-. They will get the oil very hot (requemar), or
something will be very good (retebien). Thus refrito means well fried, which they certainly are,
since they are fried until they are almost dry. I am glad to day that Santamaria in his Diccionario
de Mexicanismos bears this out, but I am embarrassed that it has taken me so long for the light to
dawn."<br>

"...the Indians, tens of centuries ago, cultivated the tomato and the pepper plants and improved
and developed them until the tiny hot and pungent berries of the latter had been transformed into
a number of varieties of peppery fruits, and the little red sourish berries of the other had become
big luscious scarlet tomatoes....Long centuries before Columbus landed on the shores of the New
World, the tomato and the peppers had spread from the land of the Incas to Central America and
Mexico where they were cultivated by the Mayas and the Aztecs who called the tomato "tomatl,"
which the Spaniards under Cortez corrupted to the name by which the fruit is know to us
today...Very probably they [chilies] are of real value and aid in warding off fevers and other

with chile peppers and ground squash seeds and consumed them mainly as a condiment served on
turkey, venison, lobster, and fish. This combination was subsequently called "salsa" by Alonso de

traditionally eaten. The msot common type of salsa was--and still is--a version of Mexican salsa cruda (raw sauce), also known
as salsa fresca (fresh sauce) or salsa Mexicana (Mexican sauce), made with chopped tomatoes, onions, and fresh green jalapeno or
serrano peppers...Salsa's popularity nationwide is generally attributed to Americans' increasing consumption of hot-and-spicy foods
during the second half of the twentieth century...Salsa are also perceived as healthy foods, because many of them are low
in calories, high in fiber, and full of vitamins."<br>

<b>What is the oldest known recipe for salsa in existence?</b><br> 
Excellent question with no simple answer. Food historians generally agree New World style <a href="foodmexican.html#salsa">salsas</a> (spicy mashed chili/tomato combinations) originated in Aztec 
Central 
America. Accurate/authentic evidence & early recipes is sketchy because this cuisine was first recorded in print by 
Spanish scholars (missionaries, mostly). Father Sahagun recorded a salsa-type food (no recipe) in 1529. 
First mention of salsa in recipe in USA print is even more challenging. 
<p>
Our survey of early "salsa" recipes in USA cookbooks and newspapers reveals these interesting points: <br>
<b>(1)</b> The term "salsa" in USA print has been used over the years to denote several items, including Italian-style tomato sauce. <br>
<b>(2) </b>Some early Mexican-style "salsa" recipes were given "Americanized" names, as in "Sauce for Tostatas." <br>
<b>(3) </b>Salsa (Mexican style) crossed the USA print border in the early 20th century, starting with bordering states (Texas, California). <br>
<b>(4) </b>1930s/1940s mainstream print happens. The concept is regional & exotic. Think: <a href="foodmexican.html#zelayetasalsa">Elena Zelayeta</a> <br>
<b>(5) </b>1950s TexMex launches mainstream USA marketing campaigns. <br>
<b>(6) </b>1970s TexMex ragingly popular. Raw salsa & chips become standard bar fare & supermarkets snacks. Think: <a href="foodmexican.html#kennedysalsa">Diana Kennedy</a>
<p>
Also worth exploring? The multicultural/cuisine connection of salsa-type recipes served by different cultures. Cajun/Creole, 
Indian, and Chinese cooks offer interesting twists in this tasty theme. <br>

Remove the crowns, then flatten and devein ten or twelve chiles; toast them in a warm oven, and when they are quite toasted, take them 
out and put them in cold water, then hot. Wipe them off and put in a casserole. Bathe the chilies in boiling water; let them soak for 
one or two hours, or let them simmer. Then take them out of the water in which they have been soaking; add a small amount of fresh 
water so the sauce will have a uniform consistency. After grinding the chilies well in a mortar, pass the sauce through a heavy 
strainer." <br>

Recipes for sopaipilla/fry-bread foods were known to ancient old world cooks. Deep fried

<b>Where does Native American fry bread fit in?</b><br>
One of the foods many people today connect with the Navajo people is fry bread. If you visit
Navajo country you will find dozens of  "traditional" fry bread stands. Many of these stands are 
run by families working out of modified RVs.  These products are remarkably similar to state fair elephant ears
and on-the-fly fritter-type delicacies.
<p>
The problem with current recipe for "traditional" fry bread (aka Indian Fry Bread, Navajo Fry Bread, Squaw
Bread) is that the ingredients (wheat flour, baking powder, refined white sugar) and cooking utensils (frying
pans, iron cauldrons) were not traditionally used by Native Americans. They were introduced to
this continent by European explorers & pioneer families. European and American cookbooks
from all time periods abound with recipes for fried breadstuffs. Think: <a href="foodfaq2.html#bannock">bannock</a>.
<p>
Why wheat & baking powder instead of maize and oil?  Some food historians tell us Native Americans embraced wheat
flour and modern leaveners for practical reasons. They could easily obtain the finished products
through trade and they  adapted well to traditional recipes. To boot? These wheat-based products
proved appealing to European/American travelers/tourists. The current recipe for fry bread
is very tasty and sells well. 
<p>
Native Americans counter that the "Americanization" their foodstuffs was a
direct byproduct of American government intervention. Products like Fry Bread are examples of what enterprising cooks create
under challenging circumstances. Yes, this is complicated. Our research confirms Native American claims. Does this reduce the
historic authenticity of Navajo Fry Bread? Certainly not. If anything? It invites an entirely new conversation.
<p>
"...the [Navajo] people produced surplus for sale and trade so as to acquire a few items for which they had acquired a taste while interned at Fort Sumner and 
depended upon federal rationing. Army rations included that typical United States beverage brewed wtih hot water and ground-up black tree-seed, coffee. Navajos 
adopted coffee as their preferred non-alcoholic beverage. Coffee calls for sugar to sweeten it, and the Navajo people eagerly sought refined sugar, which had not 
been available to them prior to U.S. sovereignity. The typical sweetener of Mexican and Spanish colonial times was panocha, brown lumps used much as white 
sugar today. Army rations relied most of all upon wheat flour, milled to remove the nutritious husks in order to faster rising in making yeast breads. Inasmuch as the 
Army failed to employ home demonstration agents to instruct Navajo women in baking techniques at Fort Sumner, Navajo women learned to employ white wheat 
flour to make 'fried bread' on a modified Mexican model. Rather than shape the dough into very thin tortillas, Navajo woman adopted the quicker course of
 frying white flour dough in deep fat skillets."<br>
---<i>The Navajo People</i>, Henry F. Dobyns and Robert C. Euler [Indian Tribal Series:Phoenix AZ] 1972 (p. 42-43)

<p>
"Fry bread, the important of the foods of the pan-Indian movement and the symbol of intertribal
unity, does not represent precontact indigenous foods ro cooking style. The origins of this dish
are apparently in the nineteenth century and reflect the ongoing cultural change that happens
everywhere. Fry bread usually is made with a dough of wheat flour and milk or water. The dough
is leavened with yeast or baking powder, kneaded, flattened into individual patties of farying sizes,
and then deep fried. Fry bread is served with a variety of accompaniments, such as honey, maple
syrup, and sugar, and sometimes wrapped around hot dogs or other filling in place of a bun or
tortilla. The Lakota today sometimes eat fry bread topped with pureed and sweetened fruit
pudding. In a variation, popovers (stuffed fry bread) are made by piling raw bread dough with a
mixture of cooked beef, chili,onion, tomato sauce, and taco seasoning and then folding and deep
frying the result. This dish sometimes is likened to tacos. Whatver the combinations, fry bread has
a central role at powwows. Some historians believe that ggru bread originated as a result to
Navajo incarceration at Fort Sumner, where the Indians had access only to flour and lard. Other
see a connection to Spanish deep-fried churros and sopaipillas, which are flat, lard-fried, breadlike
treats often served with sugar. According to another theory, the Plains Indians were among the
first to make fry bread, having been influenced in the early nineteenth century by the French, who
were particuarly noted for their fine yeast-leavened breads and who, more importantly, maintained
influence and contact with tribes throughout the Mississippi area from Canada to Louisiana. Still
another claim is that fry bread resulted from the creative efforts of inventive reservation women
with government rations." <br>

University Press:New York] 2004, Volume 2 (p. 169)
<p>
"In frontier America, as in colonial America, any form of bread made with corn instead of wheat
was the sad paste of despair," writes Ms. Fussell (p. 220). "Native corn eaters on the Southwest,
whose caste status did not depend upon wheat, nonetheless incorporated wheat into their
cornmeal pastes as the incorporated the Madonna into their Corn Mothers. A recipe for
contemporary Navaho cake, in <i>Traditional Navajo Foods and Cooking</i> [1983], is a true
child of the hybrid cuisine engendered when wheat met corn. (p. 225).

The earliest recipe we have for modern fry bread dates to the early 1930s:

tablespoon compound, flour enough to make about like biscuit dough. Roll and cut any shape

  Taco soup, as we Americans know it today, is a new twist on an old culinary theme.  It is  based
  on a long history of "New World" soups and stews. Food historians confirm that spicy tomato-based soups/stews topped with cheese, onions, and chips have existed for hundreds of years.
  These recipes originated in Central/South America, where tomatoes, chilies and <a href="foodmexican.html#tacos">
maize-based tacos</a> are indigenous.
  Recipes vary according to local ingrendients and taste. After the Columbian Exchange many
  European cultures adopted spicy tomato-based soups. Think <a href="foodsoups.html#gazpacho">Gazpacho</a>.  Sometimes these soups 
  were topped with crisp bread products. <a href="foodmexican.html#tortillasoup">Tortilla soup</a> circa 1940s may be the inspiration.
  <p>
  Our survey of magazine and newspaper articles reveals recipes called "taco soup" began appearing
  in American publications in the early 1990s. They were promoted as quick family soups composed
  primarily of canned items and packaged taco mixes. Ingredients are similar to standard American
  chili. Presumably, the end-product is thinner (aka soupier) than the traditional chili counterpart.
  There are several variations.
  <p>
  Given the timing, it is quite possible the  "inventor" of the contemporary American recipe is an
  innovative marketing team promoting its company's products. It may not be a coincidence that the

<b>Tortilla soup</b><br>
We are finding several varations on the Mexican culinary theme of Tortilla Soup. Stock, meat, vegetables and spices vary according to region and period. The common thread for all recipes is the inclusion of crisp tortillas. This crispness is achieved purposely by frying (in fat) or exposing to air (stale). Essentially, tortillas provide the grain component, commonly found in soups throughout the world. European soup grain equivalents are pasta, rice, barley, and dumplings.
Food historians generally tell us soup is ancient. It is consumed by all segments of society. Recipes have been shared, 
imported, adopted and adapted whenever peoples of divergent cuisines meet. This explains why many of the ingredients
 listed in traditional Mexican Tortilla Soup are from the Old World. <a href="foodmexican.html#tortillas">Tortillas</a> are generally the foods of the common
 Central American peoples. 
<p>
Except for the tomatoes, the other ingredients [chicken, beef, onions, oil, spinach, salt, pepper and cheese are 
"Old World" foods introduced to Mexico by Spanish settlers. The use of tortillas, in this recipe, more likely descends
from European practice of adding crisped bread to soup (think croutons & crackers) rather than ancient Mayan/Aztec customs.
<a href="foodmexican.html#tacosoup">Taco soup</a> is the the same idea, a shortcut promoted by commerical food companies.
  Tortilla soup, a tomato and chicken-broth based recipe topped with tortillas, is more closely
  aligned with authentic Mexican cuisine:
<p>
  "Ten years ago, you had to head to Mexico if you wanted to find a warming bowl of
  tortilla soup. Today, many people are enjoying Mexican fare and they're searching for
  authentic dishes, hence, classics like tortilla soup are becoming easier to find on the
  menus of neighborhood and upscale Mexican restaurants. It's no wonder. This elemental
  chicken and tortilla brew is like Mexican soul food-almost a national soup. It has been
  cooked for generations across Mexico by the upscale and humble alike, with each cook-and region-giving it a slightly 
different twist. Americans' first acquaintance with tortilla
  soup can be traced to a restaurant in the Zona Rosa, a popular nightlife and restaurant
  district in Mexico City. Fonda El Refugio started serving authentic interior and coastal
  Mexican cooking to tourists in the 1960s. Although some will argue that authentic tortilla
  soup possesses certain characteristics, there's no wrong way to make it. At its most
  fundamental, tortilla soup, or sopa de tortilla, consists of chicken broth flavored with
  roasted chilies and served with strips of fried tortillas. Cooks may add what they wish-from bits of chicken and avocado to elegant squash blossoms and vegetables, especially
  tomatoes. Some purists insist that epazote, a Mexican herb, also is an essential ingredient.
  Ellen Brown, author of <i>Southwestern Tastes</i> (HPBooks, $19.95), sees tortilla soup as a
  uniquely southwestern dish that is especially popular in Texas. Several Chicago
  restaurants serve versions of tortilla soup, including Frontera Grill, 445 N. Clark St. An
  unequivocal fan, Brown said that, "When I think of tortilla soup, "I think of the
  Mansion's.""<br>

"Tamales are made for an occasion, and an occasion is made of making them. Men, women,
children, and servants all join in with good humor, shredding, chopping, stirring, and cleaning the
husks, until all is prepared. Then everyone converges to form a real assembly line, some daubing
the husks with masa while others add the filling, fold, and stack into the steamer...Tamales are
fiesta food, the Sunday night special in many restaurants, the ceremonial food prepared in honor
of the dead on All Saints' Day--and they were eaten by the Mexican rulers long before the
Spaniards came to the New World. Those early inhabitants of Mexico also had tamales of corn
tassels mixed with aramanth seeds and the meat of ground cherries. And them made them of
tender corn, like the uchepos of Michoiacan today. And what an enormous variety there is today,
from the smallest norteno to the three-foot sacahuil from the Huastec countury...Probably the
most surprising members of the tamal family are the shrimp ones form Escuinapa in Sinaloa. Small
unskinned shrimps are used...In Sinaloa, too, they make large tamales like elongated bonbons.
They are filled with the usual pork and tomato sauce, but added to it are all sorts of vegetables cut
into little strips--zucchini, potatoes, green beans, plantains, and chiles serranos. Chiapas seems to
have more than its share of varieties. On the coast there are those of iguana meat and eggs, and
inland around Tuxtla Gutierrez the Indians make countless varieites...Tamales colados in
Campeche and Merida...are cooked in banana leaves, with a wonderfully savory filling seasoned
with achiote and epazote. The tamal itself is made of uncooked tortilla dough that has been
diluted in water, strained, and thickened over the fire...Michoaca...is famed for its tamales: the
fresh corn uchepos and the corundas--the bread of the Tarascan Indians--made of maize dough
leavened with wood ash and wrapped cunningly into rhomboid shapes with the long leaf from the
corn stalk...Throughout Mexico there are tamales filled with fish, pumpkin, pineapple, and
peanuts, and those made of black and purple corn and rice. Wherever you go you will find
something different...The tamales from central Mexico have a white, spongy dough that bears no
resemblance to the rather soggy, grayish dough of most commercial tamales available here [in the
United States]. Today the Mexican housewife has a choice of many first-class flour prepared
especially for tamales."<br>

[NOTE: This book contains several tamale recipes.]
<p>
Food historian Sophie Coe noted "Paintings of Classic Maya vases show us plates of round objects with dark spirals on their
upper surfaces, exactly the patter one would expect on the cut top of a tamale filled in this fashion...Today tamales are always 
werved with their wrappers, but this may be because postconquest additions like lard and broth make them too sloppy to be served
conveniently without them." <i>America's First Cuisines</i>, [University of Texas Press:Austin] 1994 (p. 148) 
<p>
What kinds of tamales did the <a href="foodmaya.html#tamales">Aztecs</a> eat?
<p>
"It is said that tamales saved Hernando Cortes and his men from starvation in Mexico. When the
Aztecs realized that the Spanish soldiers were not (as had been thought because of their "pure"
white skin) high priests from Quetzalcoatl, the god of plenty, they stopped giving the invaders
food. Cortes, howeever, had won the loved of a woman named Malinche and told her he would
have to leave if his men could not obtain food. Malinche told Cortes to storm the gates of the city
on a certain evening. He did, and Malinche led a group of friends who bombard the Spaniards
with tamales."<br>

"Tamales...are an important feature of Mexican food and date back to pre-Columbian
times. A specially prepared cornmeal dough, usually stuffed with something but
sometimes cooked  blind, is steamed inside little...packages of carefully trimmed corn
husks or similar wrappings such as banana leaf. The dough is...made from a particular
kind of ground nixtamalized corn kernals, and pure lard (which was not used...in pre-Columbian
times). It produces what could be described as an aromatic bun with the
consistency of firm polenta. Size and fillings vary widely...Sweet tamales are made as
well as savoury ones...Tamales are almost invariably eaten with atole, corn gruel. They
remain, as in the past, an important festival food...However, tamales have become
much more than just a festival food, being available at all seasons; they can be bought
from street vendors for breakfast."<br>

"Tamale. A term describing a wide range of dishes based on a cornmeal-flour dough
that is placed inside cornhusks (sometimes a banana leaf) and then steamed. Tamales
are of Mexican origin and were enjoyed by the Aztecs (the word comes from the
Nahuatl tamalli) in several versions, from appetizer to sweet dessert. In Mexico they are
traditionally served in restaurants on Sunday nights and as a ceremonial food on All
Saints' Day. As early as 1612 Englishman Captain John Smith mentioned a kind of
tamale made by the Indians of Virginia, and by 1691 note was made by others of a
bean-filled tamale of the Southwest...Tamale pie. A Dish of cornmeal mush milled with
chopped meat and a hot chili sauce. The term first appeared in 1911."<br>

<b>About Tamale Pie</b>
<p>
"Origin of Tamale Pie. In <i>The Dictionary of American Food and Drink</i> (revised edition, 1994), John Mariani writes that the 
term "tamale pie" first appeared in print in 1911. It may be so, but my own research has turned up nothing that predates
World War I. Then, as during World War II, women were urged to save meat. <i>Conservation Recipes</i> (1918), a booklet
compiled by the Mobliized Women's Organization of Berkeley and published by the Berkeley Unit, Council of Defence Women's Committee,
offers five recipes for Tamale Pie, each from a different woman. All are completely meatless and all contain corn, cornmeal,
and tomatoes in some form (puree, sauce, canned tomates., etc.). Some enrich the mix with ripe olives or cheese, and some
don't. Tamale pie also appears in <i>Everyday Foods in Wartime</i> (1918) by Mary Swartz Rose, assistant professor, Department
of Nutrition, Teachers College, Columbia University, New York...The Tamale Loaf in <i>Good Housekeeping's Book of Menus, Recipes,
and Household Discoveries</i> (1922) also adds ground beef, only here it's cooked, then ground...The July 1941 issue of 
<i>Sunset</i> published a tamale pie in its popular "Kitchen Cabinet" column and called it a version of "a long-time Western
favorite." A Chicken Tamale Pie (with canned corn) makes the 1943 edition of <i>Joy of Cooking</i> and another chicken
variation, the 1948 <i>Boston Cooking-School Cook Book</i>. Tamale pie surged in popularity after World War II, when, according to 
Gerry Schremp (<i>Kitchen Culture: Fifty Years of Food Fads</i>, 1991), it became the darling of potluck suppers."<br>

First, there was <a href="foodmexican.html#maize">maize<a>. Then, there were tortillas:
<p>
"Tortilla...a round, thin unleavened bread made from ground maize, a basic food of Mesoamerica.
It is not known how many millennia this has been a staple; but when the conquistadores arrived in
the New World in the late 15th century, they discovered that the inhabitants made flat corn
breads. The native Nahuatl name for these was tlaxcalli and the Spanish gave them the name
tortilla...The art of tortilla-making was highly developed by the native Mesoamericans; 17th
century Spanish observed, Francisco Hernandez, remarked on the fine, almost transparent tortillas
prepared for important people....Fresh tortillas are eaten as bread, used as plate and spoon, or
filled to make composite dishes such as tacos and enchiladas."<br>
---<i>The Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford]
1999 (p. 803)
<p>
"The most common and popular antojito (appetizer) of all is the everyday taco. You just take a
warm tortilla, put some cooked and shredded meat across it, couse the meat with a sauce, and roll
up the tortilla. In true Mexican style, which you tip one end of it toward your mouth you should
curl the other up with your little finger so that none of the sauce is lost. Not quite so common is
the fried taco...Of course, there are exceptions to this...for in parts of Jalisco and Sinaloa they
make thin tortillas especially for crisp tacos, and in Yucatan the cotzito is a taco, tightly rolled
around some shredded meat and fried crisp. In Chihuahua and Baja California they just double the
tortilla over and fry it--but it is practically never fried crisp."<br>
---<i>The Cuisines of Mexico</i>, Diana Kennedy [Harper & Row:New York] 1972 (p. 116-7)
<p>
"Tortillas are small flat maize-flour cakes served hot with a variety of fillings of toppings. They
are of
Mexican origin, and have become more widely known in the late twentieth century owing to the
increasing
popularity of Tex-Mex cuisine. Etymologically, the word means virtually 'little tart'. It is an
American Spanish
diminutive of the Spanish torta, 'round cake', which in turn goes back to late Latin torta (probably
source of
English tart). It was first mentioned in an English text as long ago as the end of the seventeenth
century
(Tartilloes are small Cakes made of the Flower of Indian Corn,' William Dampier, New Voyage
Round
World, 1699), but it did not really become established until the mid-ninetheenth century."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford Univeristy Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 347)    
  
<p>
"Tortilla...The world comes from the Spanish-American diminutive for the Spanish torta, "round
cake." (In
Spain, the tortilla espanola is more like an omelet.)"<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariana [Lebhar-Friedman:New
York] 1999
(p. 330)   
<p>
"A Spanish tortilla has nothing in common with its Mexican counterpart except its Latin
root--torte, meaning
a round cake...a Spanish tortilla is simply a potato omelet.."<br>
