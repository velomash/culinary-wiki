Judge Jr.'s <i>Here's How</i> [Judge Publishing:New York 1927] is the quintessential catalog of prohibition-era 
mixology. Beverages are presented with playful headnotes and closing toasts. "Gordon Water" is a primary ingredient.
This was gin. Whether "bathtub" or brand name, the author does not elucidate. "McCarty" is defined thusly: "An amber-colored 
liquid that comes from Havana, usually in pockets." If you know what this is can you please <a href="mailto:foodtimeline@aol.com">
share?</a>. The author omits mixing instructions, garnishes and glassware.
Indeed, this trim book (3" X 5", 63 pages) packs a punch. Additional information on <a href="fooddecades.html#speakeasy">speakeasy dining
& prohibition parties</a>.
