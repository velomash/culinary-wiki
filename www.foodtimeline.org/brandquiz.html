<b>Aunt Sammy</b><br>
The practice of having many
women "speak" as a unified persona was well established in the 1920s-30s. Think: 
<a href="http://generalmills.com/~/media/Files/history/hist_betty.ashx">Betty Crocker</a> and 
<a href="brandquiz.html#prudencepenny">Prudence Penny</a>. The U.S. Government's
"Aunt Sammy" (presumably Uncle Sam's domestic partner) also published recipes and hosted short, instructive radio cooking shows. The
real "Aunt Sammy's" were often local home economists and agricultural extension agents. Did you know? <i>Aunt Sammy's Radio
Recipes</i> c. 1932 was the first cookbook to be published in braille.
<p>
"Aunt Sammy came to life with the first radio broadcast of "Housekeeper's Chat" on October 4,
1926. The character of Aunt Sammy--wife of Uncle Sam--was created by the USDA Bureau of
Home Economics and the Radio Service. Many women across the country played the part as they
spoke into the microphones of local radio stations. The highlights of Aunt Sammy's show were
the menus and recipes, but Aunt Sammy also talked about clothing, furniture, appliances, and
other family and household matters. Aunt Sammy wasn't just a homebody, however. She
commented on world affairs, reported the latest fads, and told jokes. The talk moved easily from
one subject to another, always natural and entertaining as well as informative. Aunt Sammy soon
became popular. By the end of the first year her program was carried by 43 radio stations. By
1932, 194 stations were broadcasting Aunt Sammy's show...Many listeners wrote for copies of
the recipes, and the Bureau of Home Economics answered these requests with weekly
mimeographed sheets. In 1927 the most popular recipes were assembled into a pamphlet..."Aunt
Sammy's Radio Recipes" was revised and enlarged three times between 1927 and 1931. In 1932
it became the first cookbook published in braille.
Aunt Sammy faded out during the Great Depression...The radio show became drier and more
factual and was renamed "Homemaker Chats." In 1946 it was discontinued."

Who was Dinty Moore? <a href="brandquiz.html#dintycharacter">Cartoon strip character</a>, <a href="brandquiz.html#dintyman">NYC restaurateur</a>, and <a href="brandquiz.html#dintybrand">meat product brand name</a>. In that order. 
<p> 
"Q. When I was a kid I loved Dinty Moore beef stew. Recently I learned that Dinty Moore's was for many years a popular New York 
restaurant. Who was Dinty Moore, and was he, in fact, the man behind the stew? 
A. In 1913, George McManus, a cartoonist for The New York American, created a comic strip called 'Bringing Up Father,' which satirized the 
struggles of Jiggs and Maggie, a working-class Irish couple thrust by sudden wealth into the world of New York's pampered elite. 
Jiggs, who longs for his pervious life, returns often to the tavern owned by his old pal, Dinty Moore. 'Bringing Up Father' was an 
instant and enduring hit. It became a daily feature in 1916. George McManus sometimes visited James Moore's Irish-style restaurant at 
216 West 46th Street. Convinced that he was the inspiration for the Dinty Moore of comic strip fame, Mr. Moore took the name for his 
restaurant, which became a popular Midtown hangout for sports heroes, celebrities and swells. Corned beef and cabbage was a specialty, of course. 
So was Irish Stew. Other Dinty Moore's were opened in cities across the country. In the 1930's, a meat retailer in Minneapolis 
registered the Dinty Moore name and sold a cured meat product called Dinty Moore Picnics. Hormel Foods bought the name an marketed 
its own steamed-beef-and-gravy product, at 15 cents a can, starting in 1935. The stew was renowned for its long shelf life. Later Hormel 
introduced a shortlived Dinty Moore character, a cartoon lumberjack, to help sell the product, which remains popular. The restaurant 
on 46th Street, with its polished brass and mahogany bar, was considered a virtual landmark when it closed in the early 1970s." <br>

<b>Dinty Moore, comic strip character</b> <br> 
Dinty Moore, a popular Irish saloon keeper & fabulous cook, was created by George McManus in his strip "Bringing Up Father. Most sources state he based this character on <a href="brandquiz.html#dintyman">James Moore</a>, a real person who ran popular Irish restaurant in New York City. McManus was a regular custormer of Moore's. Bringing Up Father debuted in Hearst newspapers January 12, 1913. Moore's restaurant opened in 1914. We have not yet identified the exact date the Dinty Moore character first appeared in the comic strip. The connection appears to be solid. 
<p> 
<b>[1913] </b><br> 
"When George McManus created Brining Up Father for the Hearst organization, he was already a cartoonist of high repute. Bringing Up Father, which first appeared in the dailies in 
1913, was only one of a number of strip ideas that McManus had played around with. It was sometimes missing for weeks at a time, and only in 1916 did it become 
definitively established (wth the Sunday version following on April 14, 1918)...Inspired by William Gill's 1893 play The Rising Generation (which McManus saw as a 
child), the strip...resembles a skit or playlet, loaded with witty dialogue, nutty characters and outlandish happenings. The underlying theme of the strip is quite simple...Jiggs, 
a former mason, and hiw wife Maggie, an ex-washerwoman, have suddenly become wealthy by winning the Irish sweepstakes. But while Maggie, the epitome of ugliness, 
snobbishness, and egotism, seeks to forget her social origins, Jiggs' only wish is to meet his buddies at Dinty Moore's tavern for a dish of corned beef and cabbage and a 
friendly game of pineochle...Bringing up Father was one of the very few comic strips in which all strata of society are represented in an astounding gallery of portraits ranging all the way from the 
upper crust to the lower depths...Bringing Up Father was the first comic strip to enjoy worldwide fame...In the 1920s a stage play, Father, toured the United States and Canada, and 
McManus himself appeared as Jiggs in some of the productions." <br>

<b>Dinty Moore, restaurateur</b><br> 
On March 7, 1914, brothers William Moore and James Moore Jr. opened an Irish eatery at 216 West Forty-sixth Street, Manhattan New York. Family members lived above the restaurant. Early newspaper reports confirm this establishement was in frequent violation of the Volstead Act (aka prohibition). References in the 1920s confirm the place was known as "Dinty Moore's" but they are fuzzy about which brother was "Dinty." Subsequent references confirm James was the proud owner of this moniker. Newspaper accounts paint Dinty Moore's as a popular hangout catering to celebrities and business moguls. Presumably, its reputation as a speakeasy generated a devoted clientele. This would be the perfect place for a Jiggs-type character to find solace. Indeed, George McManus, Jiggs' creator, was a frequent patron. We do not know when the restaurant was officially named Dinty Moore's. Our survey of historic newspapers also confirmed several other "Dinty Moore" restaurants throughout the country. They do not appear to be related.

"Five detectives under the driection of Inspector James Bolan, just at the beginning of the dinner hour last night, raided 'Dinty' 
Moore's restaurant, at 216 West Forty-sixth Street, two doors from Broadway, where they seized alleged intoxicants valued at 
$10,000 and made two arrests. The news that Moore's, a popular theatrical rendezvous, was receiving a visit form the police rapidly spread along the 
Rialto, and before detectives had completed their work a dense crowd gathered. It was necessary to call the reserves from the 
West Forty-seventh Street Station to clear the street. The search warrant for the raid was issued by Supreme Court Justice McAvoy. 
Detective Thomas Sheehan alleged that he purchased a pint of 'Canadian ale' from Charles Cusacke, a waiter, which upon 
examination he found to be whisky. As the warrant included the five stories of the building housing the restaurant, the detectives made a 
thorough search of the premise. The first and second floors were filled with diners when the police entered and there was consternation and a 
rapid movement among many, according to the police, to get rid of liquids. The alleged liquors were found on the fourth floor above the living 
quarters of James Moore, the proprietor. Moore told the police that the goods siezed had been purchased before the Volstead act went into 
effect. Moore and Cusacko were arrested and released in $500 bail each on the charge of violating the Mullan-Gage Act. The alleged 
liquor was carried to the West Forty-seventh Street Station, four trips being necessary. The police said the seizure included eighteen cases of 
Black and White whisky, 200 bottles of wine and 200 bottles of champagne." <br>

"William J. Moore, known as 'Dinty' Moore, his brother, James Moore Jr., and nine others arrested early on New Year's Day at 216-220 West 
Forty-sixth Street on charges of violating the Volstead act, were released under bail ranging from $1,000 for 'Dinty' to $500 for each of the ten 
others yesterday for a further hearing on Jan. 24....The affidavit charged that when Spahr [an Internal Revenue officer] and others went to 
Moore's establishment without a search warrant, under an agreement with 'Dinty' oin a padlock court several months ago, they found and 
confiscated the following: Forty-six pints of ale, 64 1/2 pints of rye, 31 1/2 quarts of rye, 6 1/2 pints of Scotch, 2 quarts of brandy, 1 quart of 
kummel, 2 quarts of other cordials, 2 quarts of gin, 6 quarts of vermuth, 2 bottles of stout and 3 quarts and 3 pints of champagne. When Moore 
was arrested on a charge of violating the Volstead act several months ago he protested his innocence. He escaped a padlock, but was required to 
sign a written agreement making it possible for Federal officers to search his place without a warrant, and to post a bond which may now be 
forfeited."<br>

"James (Dinty) Moore, 77-year-old owner of the Dinty Moore restaurant at 216 West Forty-sixth Street, patronized for many reasons by many of 
the city's notables...was fined $5,000 yesterday by Magistrate Charles E. Ramsgate in the War Emergency Court for 272 violations of the Office of 
Price Administration regulations on ceiling prices for his meals. The magistrate could have added a straight jail sentence, but refrained, he said, 
because of the restaurateur's age...Moore, in defense of his overceiling charges to his patrons, had explained he had never reduced the size of the 
portions he served and insisted that it would be impossible for him to comply wtih the OPA regulations because his expenses, including wages, had 
mounted sharply since the price ceilings were put into effect." <br>

"James A. Moore, 83, New York restaurateur, died today. He was the owner of Dinty Moore's a well known restaurant in the Broadway theater district. 
Moor opened his establishment 38 years ago. He was a close friend of George McManus, the cartoonist, who dubbed the restaurant owner Dinty. McManus later gave the 
name Dinty Moore to one of the characters in his comic strip. And Moore, himself, then gave the name to his restaurant." <br> 
---"'Dinty Moore,' Restaurateur of Comics, Dead," <i>Chicago Daily Tribune</i>, December 26, 1952 (p. B4) 
<p> 
<b>[1964] </b><br> 
"Dinty Moore's, to comic strip followers, is the restaurant where Jiggs is always sneaking off for a corned beef and cabbage when Maggie's nagging 
gets too much for him. In real life, Dinty Moore's is the restaurant in the heart of Broadway where the big names from the theater, film, publishing, 
broadcasting and sporting fraternities repair to wheel and deal and eat corned beef and cabbage. Little has changed in the restaurant at 216 West 
46th Street since James Moore opened its doors on March 7, 1914--and this perhaps explains much of its magnetism. The polished brass at the 
bar, the gold-plated faucets in the men's room downstairs and the eye-level mirrors that circle the room give the place a turn-of-the-century air... 
Mr. Moore, who died in the restaurant on Christmas Day in 1952, took the name Dinty from the comic strip, 'Bringing Up Father,' which was created 
by his long-time friend and customer, George McManus. Since Mr. Moore's death, the business has been run by his daughter Anna. Soon after she 
took over, she had the sign outside changed from 'Dinty Moore's' to just 'Moore's,' reportedly because of long-standing differences with her father. 
The name on the menu has also been changed, but the green and white matchbooks still bear the original name. Many of the regular patrons have 
their own special tables and waiters, and they will accept none other...The status section of Dinty Moore's is on the left as you walk in, just 
beyond the bar. In the old days, prominent judges and politicians, such as James A. Farliey, used to be frequent visitors....the employee recalled 
numerous baseball celebrities who used to drop in and still do--Eddie Brannick, Mel Allen and Joe DiMaggio. 'We would get a lot of them around 
World Series time, even umpires,'...Among the restaurant's attractions are its open kitchen, its roomy tables...and its reputation for simple, good 
food. The kitchen is still known for the corned beef and Irish stew that James Moore started with, but the menu us now sophisticated and a good 
deal more expensive ($7 for a sirloin steak, 75 cents for an order of green peas)." <br>

<b>[1970] </b><br> 
"Dinty Moore's Seafood House, 216 West 46th Street, 765-8215. Over the years there have been a few restaurants that should be declared national monuments, and among them I would have 
named P.J. Clarke's, which happily goes on forever, McSorley's Saloon of recent front-page fame and Dinty Moore's. Well, Dinty Moore's is still with us, at least in name and 
location, but it is not the restaurant I had in mind. The restaurant I had in mind was the splendid, immaculate, warm, friendly, old-fashioned place with mirrors everywhere and black 
and white decor. The Moore family sold it some months ago to some Broadway people, and now the decor is decidedly showbiz and on the common side...The mirrors have been 
replaced with red plush, and the walls are outfitted with nautical etchings, ship models, sheet music of yesteryear and all of that jazz. Before it changed hands Dinty Moore's had fresh, 
good rye on the table, and a first-rate bean soup, and a simple, chopped sweet and sour cabbage salad and among other good things, an excellent deep-fried sea bass 
(even when it came out over cooked, it was good) with stewed tomatoes...The new Dinty Moore's corned beef was edible if overcooked and served on overcooked cabbage." <br>

"Dinty Moore was not the name of the stew's creator, who was Jay Catherwood Hormel (1892-1954), son of George A. Hormel, founder of the US company that produced it. The 24-ounce cans of stew were originally known by the company name, as Hormel Beef Stew. in 1936, however, Hormel entered into an agreement with C.F. Witt & Sons, a large grocery and meat firm in Minneapolis, to sell and distribute its meat products under the Dinty Moore trademark, which C.F. Witt already owned. Witt, in turn, was granted the right to sell other food products that were not canned goods under the Dinty Moore name. But Hormel's use of the name was soon challenged. it turned out that Dinty Moore was the name of a character in that gag strip Bringing Up Father, an epic comedy of husband-and-wife strife first appearing in 1913. Hormel thus appeared to be infringing the rights of the strip's creator, Geroge McManus (1884-1954). legal advice was taken, and it was declared that there was no direct competition between Dinty Moore the stew and Dinty Moore the cartoon character, so that Hormel had not violated McMannus' rights or those of his publishers, King Features. MacManus later revealed that he got the name of the corner saloon owner Dinty Moore from that of a bellhop in a St. Louis hotel."<br>

<b>Dinty Moore's original Corned beef & cabbage recipe </b><br> 
This recipe's headnote "certifies" authenticity. The cookbook author was a celebrity in his own right. It is quite possible the recipe came straight from Dinty Moore's kitchen. 
<blockquote> 
"Corned Beef is pickled in brine and requires a lot of boiling (simmering from 3 to 6 hours). It is usually served with boiled cabbage 
and its natural condiment is mustard; it needs no other. Dinty Moore's Corn Beef and Cabbage. Contributed by James Moore, 216 
West 46th Street, New York City, through courtesy of Charles Gillen, Commissioner, Newark, N.J. Place well selected properly cured 
corned beef in cold water, bring to a boil and boil for 3 1/2 hours, skimming every 20 minutes. Add fresh boiling water if 
necessary to keep beef covered. Fifteen minutes before it is finished add 1 lb. of granulated sugar for every 20 lbs. of 
beef. Allow beef to cool in water in which it was boiled, for 1 1/2 hour. Put cabbage in cold water with piece of pork and boil from 
18 to 20 minutes. Remove pot from the fire and heat up when wanted. (Will keep white for 24 hours.) With this corned beef 
and cabbage, which so often made Father leave home, Dinty always served potatoes, which he cooked as follows: Wash good-sized Irish 
potatoes but do not remove the skins. Boil in very highly salted water (brine) until 'hard boiled'--25-35 minutes. Keep skins 
intact and dry potatoes in oven for 20 minutes or so. Serve with plenty of butter..." <br>

<b>Dinty Moore's Irish Stew recipe</b><br> 
The recipe below was shared by George Rector, chef of the famous Rector's restaurant in New York City. Both Rector and Moore were popular restaurateurs. It is very possible they shared recipes as well as clientele. 
<blockquote> 
"This is what Jim 'Dinty' Moore did when I frist smelled the Irish stew steaming out of his kitchen. It's the same Dinty Moore, by the way, who was immortalized by George McManus, whose corned beef and cabbage Jiggs was sure to be eating when he could get away from Maggie. And Dinty has one corking fine restaurant in New York where you'll find a lot of other fine people besides Jigs. But I'll let you judge for yourself. Here's the stew. You'll need: 
1 pound chuck of beef<br> 
3 pounds shoulder of lamb<br> 
1 pound breast of lamb<br> 
4 medium sized potatoes<br> 
6 medium sized carrots<br> 
2 medium sized green peppers, diced<br> 
1/4 cup leeks<br> 
1/2 cup diced celery<br> 
1 cup canned tomato pulp<br> 
1 teaspoon prepared mustard<br> 
1 tablespoon Wocestershire sauce<br> 
1 tablespoon A-1 sauce<br> 
1 tablespoon ketchup<br> 
salt and pepper to taste<br> 
1/2 cup cooked green peas<br> 
2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley<br> 
Cut all the meat in pieces two inches square, taking off all the fat you can. Start the beef to cook in just enough water to cover, then simmer one hour. Simmer the lamb in enough water to cover for thirty minutes; from time to time skim the fat off the top. Combine carrots--cut in quarters--green peppers, onions, leeks and celery. Simmer for another half hour. Put the seasonings with the tomato pulp, add this to the stew, and continue the cooking for ten minutes longer. Serve with garnish of green peas and parsley. This is Irish stew a la Dinty Moore--and it's undoubtedly the best Irish stew Chef Robin Hood Rector ever went a snooping for."<br>

<p>
<b>General summary</b><br>
"Lalla Rookh. A nineteenth-century dessert made with eggs, spirits, and whipped cream, although there are many variations. A 
1910 cookbook by San Francisco chef Victor Hirtzler of the Hotel St. Francis listed Lalla Rookh was nothing more than a creme de menthe cordial 
poured over ice in a sherbet glass to be served as a digestive between courses. The name comes from a long poem about a 
beautiful princess of India, Lalla Rookh (1817), by Thomas Moore. The poem, praised for its 'barbaric splendors' and exotic 
details, was a great success in both England and America, and this rich dessert was named after the poem's heroine." <bR>

"Lalla Rookh (fl. 1600s). Indian princess. Lalla Rookh means Tulip Cheek; flourished the 1600s; supposed daughter of Aurangzeb (1618-1707), Mughul emperor (r. 1658-1707). Lalla Rookh was the supposed daughter of Aurangzeb, the last great Mugul emperor of India, who had nine children with his harem of four wives...As presented in the 1817 poem Lalla Rookh by Thomas Moore, Lalla Rookh was betrothed to Aliris, sultan of lesser Bulcharia. On her journey from Delhi to Cashmere, she was entertained by Feramorz, a young Persian poet, with whom she fell in love. Lalla Rookh was delighted when she learned that the young poet was the sultan to whom she was betrothed." <br>

<b>Mary Ann</b><br> 

"Mary Ann" was a popular American brand of measuring cups and cake pans in the first half of
the 20th century. These products were originally manufactured by the Edward Katzinger
Company in Chicago, Illinois. According to Moody's Industrial Manual (1945), The Edward
Katzinger Company was originally founded in 1888, and incorporated under Illinois laws
October 6, 1903. An article in the <i>New York Times</i> described Katzinger's as
"probably the largest manufacturer of household cutlery, kitchen wares, baking tins, etc. in the
country." ("Magazine Suggested Goods Be Improved:Good Housekeeping Gave Seal to Non-Advertised Products," 
<i>New York Times</i>, April 10, 1940 p. 41). 
<p>
Because these products were so
popular, generic references to "Mary Ann" bases (cake pans) and measures (cups/spoons) can
also be found in advertisements/literature distrubuted by competing manufacturers. <a href="brandquiz.html#maryanncakes">"Mary Ann" cakes</a>,
round sponge with top indentation to hold sweet filling, are still popular. We see them, in both personal and family sizes, 
paired with strawberries in our supermarkets during the "shortcake" season. Most of us today are unaware of the original name. 
<p>
In 1944, Katzinger changed
its name to EKCO Products (<i>New York Times</i> advertisement, July 6, 1944, p. 21). EKCO is now owned by World Kitchens 
Inc. We don't find references to Mary Ann products in EKCO's
web site but a google search confirms you can still buy Mary Ann (aka Marianne) pans online.

"To our minds, one of the most interesting and curiously named pastries bears the name Mary Ann. Although we have been asked many 
times over the years, we have never been able to pinpoint the origin of this dessert's name, and we would give much to know. 
Mary Ann cakes, as they are sometimes called, come in two sizes: large, and small or 'miniature.' Basically, a Mary Ann is 
spongecake that is round like as standard cake, but has a shallow, uniform depression in the cetner. (Mary Ann pans, essential for
creating this shape, can be purchased in fine kitchenware shops across of the country.) The reason for the depression is to receive an 
assortment of garnishes--such as seweetend, cut fruits or berries, custard or whipped cream and, quite often, a combination of such 
good things. The design of Mary Anns, the small or 'miniature' versions in particular, makes them ideal for such desserts as
strawberry and other 'shortcakes' as well as for baked Alaskas. We offer here our version of Mary Ann spongecake, plus two
of these variation.
<p>
<b>"Mary Ann Spongecakes</b><br>
1 cup sifted confectioners' sugar<br>
2/3 cup sifted cornstarch<br>
3 eggs, separated<br>
1/8 teaspoon creamof tartar<br>
2 tablespoons water<br>
1/2 teaspoon vanilla<br>
<b>1.</b> Preheat oven to 350 degrees.<br>
<b>2.</b> Sift together one-half cup of the sugar and the cornstarch three times. Set aside.<br>
<b>3.</b> Beat the egg whites, cream of tartar and water in a large bowl with a rotary beater or electric mixer until the mixture
 stands in soft peaks. Gradually beat in the remaining one-half cup of sugar, a little at a time, continuing to beat until stiff
peaks form when the beater is raised. Add the egg yolks and vanilla; beat only until well blended.<br>
<b>4.</b> Fold in the sugar-cornstarch mixture, a little at a time, until it is all added and well blended.<br>
<b>5.</b> Pour the batter into nine lightly buttered, individual Mary Ann tins (the capacity of each tin is about three-quarters cup).
 Or pour the batter into two ungreased eigth-inch cake pans. Bake until the cake rebounds to the touch when pressed lightly in the center. 
For Mary Ann pans, the baking time is about 15 minutes; for the cake pans, about 30 minutes. Place on whire racks and 
cool. Cut around the edges of the cakes before removing them from the pans.<br>
Yield: Nine Mary Ann cakes or two eight-inch layers.<br>
Note: Leftover Mary Ann cakes freeze very well. You can make these in batches and use them anytime."<br>

<p>
What makes this “cookbook” most interesting is that it was published as a drug company promotion. Ads for "Mrs. Winslow’s Soothing Syrup” and other patent 
medicines are prominently featured throughout the publication. Mrs. Winslow’s medication was promoted for quieting teething children and a raft of discomfiting
 ailments.
The recipes in this book are short and common. Presumably, they were included as an enticement to female customers who were the primary market for the medicine. Other patent medicines were also advertised.
Published annually in pamphlet form 1860—1878 (?). Sold in drug stores & pharmacies.
<p>
The 1874 edition (linke above, p. 7) endeavors to answer the question: “Who is Mrs. Winslow?” Details are sketchy. We are told she is a lady with 30 years of
 experience and possibly some medical training (nurse, physician). We find no print evidence supporting “Mrs. Winslow” was a real person. This is not unusual. 
Think: Betty Crocker.
<p>
The earliest print reference we find for Mrs. Winslow’s Soothing Syrup was a newspaper ad published in 1853:<br>
"An Old and Experienced Nurse offers her aid to mothers--Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Syrup, for children teething, will give immediate relief in every case. Ladies are constatnly saying
it operates like magic, never fails to cure the Dysentery and Diarrhoea in children. Depend upon it, mothers, if will give rest to yourselves and comfort and health to your children."<br>
---classified ad, <i>New York Daily Times</i>, January 1, 1853 (p. 6)
<p>
The last references are from 1912, when the drug, alonng with many popular "patent medicines"  
was banned by the newly formed Food and Drug Administration. 
Articles from the 1990s detailing the history of drug use in the United States confirm Mrs. Winslow “soothing” agent was morphine/opium. This was a common 
painkiller during the Civil War and the 2nd half of the 19th century.

<b>Who was the Mystery Chef?</b><br> 
John MacPherson [1876-1955] was a gregarious wealthy Scottish bon vivant sent to America by his father at age 30 to learn the value of money. Instead? He taught himself how to cook. And then he parlayed that knowledge into a media empire. MacPherson says he cloaked his identity out of respect for his mother, who was embarrased about having a son who "cooked." We never discover what his father thought about MacPherson's career. 
<p> 
<b>Where did he come from?</b><br> 
"Perhaps I should start this book by answering a question that so many have asked: 'How did I, a man, ever come to take up cooking as a hobby? ' Well, the answer is--I
 didn't take up cooking as a hobby. Some would say I drifted into it by accident, through I myself don't believe such things happen by accident. I am a Scot, and therefore 
I see design in all things. I came to America in 1906 from London where I owned a prosperous, rapidly growing advertising business. I came here looking for American business, and later decided to stay and learn American methods. I left my London business in the hands of my father, who was a director in various large companies, and a fine old gentleman of the Schotch school. He always said that he wished i 
couldn't make money so easily, because I spent money much too freely; in fact, he said that I spent more money in a month than he had spent at my age in a year. My father decided that my visit to America was his chance to teach me the real value of money, and so, instead of sending me the L100 remittance that I had arranged for his to send, he sent me L2, and wrote saying he would send me L2 a week, and that ought to be plenty for a youngster of my age. In vain I expostulated with him, pointing out that street car concudtors in New York City got more than twice as much as he expected me to live on. But he would not weaken. This all led to a quick change in my method of living; instead of throwing away money on extravagant parties, I gave up my rooms in the hotel, and having looked around, found rooms in a boarding house. The house was fine, but words fail me when I try to tell you how bad the meals were." (p. v) 
<p> 
<b>What was his culinary training & cooking philosophy? </b><br> 
"In that boarding house I joined forces with a man who, like myself, had been used to the best of everything in life. After talking it over, we left the boarding house; took a
 furnished apartment and started to cook some of our own meals. At first we broiled chops and steaks, and then I roasted a piece of beef. it was good. I roasted a chickn 
cooking vegetables as well as potatoes, and we began to feel that we were getting somewhere, so we invited our first guests to dinner. They seemed to think we were 
quite marvelous. By this time I got a real thrill out of cooking, and I began to branch out and cook new things...Married, now, for over twenty-five years, I have cooked
 practically every meal, every day....Once you treat cooking as an art, it will quickly prove itselff to be one of the most fascinating of all arts. To me it is not strange that I should find pleasusre in cooking. What does seem strange to me is that so few people do find pleaures in it or know that many of the world's greatest men have found pleasure and relaxation in the art of excellent cookign. Thye are surporsed to hear that Alexandre Dumas was a wonderful cook, and that the last book he wote was a cook book.: (p. v-vi) "When you sit down at your dinner table tonight, think for a moment of how many people were employed in the growoing and preparation of the ingredients you used in cooking that dinner. When I say ten thousand men and women help us to prepare each meal, I believe the estimate is conservative; and I think you will agree with me when we have traced through the people involved in the production of just one ingredient form its source to your table." (p.x) .
<p> 
<b>Why the mystery?</b><br>
"Perhaps I should ansewer the qusetion that I am sure many would ask: why do I call myself The Myster Chef? The reason was a good one at the time I decided to use it. My dear mohter, who was alive at the time, was horrified when she first heard that I had taken to cooking as a hobby. My mother became reconciled to the fast that I had become an expert in the art of cooking, but she always thought that I should keep it under my hat. She had trained each of my sisters to have a complete knowledge of household management...To my mother it as only right and propler that each of her daughters should know all about household management and cooking, but for a son to be taking an interest in the kidtch--well, that was different! Now one could hardly call broadcasting about cooking 'keeping my hobby under my hat,' so that in deference to myh mother's wishes, i decided touse the namme of the Mystery Chef. now that my mother has passed on, and I have become known to millions as The Mystery Chef, it is better that I keep that name, because after all, as I have so often said in my radio talks, 'Who I am doesn't matter. it is what I have to say that counts.' And I say, 'Always be an artist at the stove, not just somebody who cooks.'"

<p> 
<b>The cook books</b><br> 
"For the last four or five years the 'Mystery Chef' has been broadcasting his knowledge of cooking, and his ardent conviction that cooking should always be practiced as a fine art, with such success that his radio fans have begged him to preeserve for them in book form the wisdom to which they have been listening. This volume is the result. But he still keeps his incognito, although in the intorduction he explains how he came to take up cooking as a hobby and why he has kept up his interest in it for almost thirty years. A chapter devoted to fundamntal informaiton about cooking will, the auther declares, enable any one who profits by it to become a good cook, because it contains all the basic instruction needed. Any one, he insists who can successfully cook these dishes and follow there instructions can use any recipe, turn any formula into a tasty dish.

"One day several years ago a man obliged a friend by taking his place on a radio program. This man had been trained as a chemical engineer but his lifelong hobby had been cooking. So he talked about cooking from his own unique, common-sense point of iew. It as a new point of view that took the mystery and the trouble out of cooking and put simplicity and pleasure into it. Several thousand letters came in to the radio station asking for more. A great food company asked this man to undertake a regular talk on cooking. He consented and The Mystery Chef was born to the air. He became one of the ranking stars of the radio world and he and his sponsors were swamped with demands for a complete cook book containing his famous eays recipes for delicious meals. The Mystery Chef's Own Cook Book was written and published. tens of thousands of women--and men--expert cooks, even those who couldn't boil water, practical cooks willing to be shown easier, more economical ways, brought it; and now the publishers and The Mystery Chef have cooperated to cut its cost in half so that tens of thousands more may enjoy the pleasure and profit in cooking The Mystery Chef's way. The new Mystery Chef's Own Cook Book is the same, original, large, 366-page book with new recipes and a new jacket. There are its uniuqe features: It is really explicit; anyone who can read can carry out its directions and make delciious dishes. The Mystery Chef does not assume that you know anything about cooking or cooking terms: when he tells you to 'fold in an egg' he explains just what one does. And yet the recipes are so arranged that the experienced cook can see their essentials at a glance without bothering with all the detailed directions. All the ordinary cooking problems are reduced to a chapted on 'Basic Cooking.' When you have mastered this, you can cook the usual foods and prepare delciious meals. It gives a large groups of 'Coordinated Recipes'--entire dinners, with full and explicit directions for every move in preparation, and a time schedule, so that the most inexpereinced can bring the meal off successfully with each dish done on time. This coordinated timing of meals is one of the most important features ever put in a cook book. There is an entire section of 'Famous national Dishes; which are authentic but interpreted in understandable terms with available ingredients. There is a large section of the most exciting and revolutionary cooking tips. And besides all that there is a complete range of carefully tested recipes covering everything from soup to nuts."<br>

'Who I am doesn't matter,' he would frequently remind us; 'it's what I have to say that counts.' He had been cooking for more than 25 years, since his arrival in America and his tenancy in a boardinghouse where the food was so bad that he was forced to cook his own. The 10,000 recipes he had collected ran from rare to common, from frugal to rich, and contained 200 special menus of the world's great men (Burbank, Edward VII, Steinmetz, etc.). He progresses from local radio to sydication to the networks. His earliest network sponsor was the Davis Baking Company. The most important ingredient of any recipe, he said, was love: 'You must go into the kitchen with love in your heart for what you are about to do, and for the people who will eat your cooking.'"<br>

<b>How successul was the Mystery Chef?</b><br>
"He's a gray-haired Scotsamn with a British accent, a former advertising executve and a favorite of 7,000,000 housewives, but hardly anybody knows his name. When he started broadcasting twelve years ago he called himself The Mystery Chef (he still does), and he appealed to the depression audience because he taught them how to save money on meals. Last week he came back, after more than a year of silence, with a new program five afternoons a week at 2:15 EWT over the Blue network and a bigger audience than ever. In his first full network series, he'll concentrate on beating today's soaring food prices, with special emphasis on meat rationing. I'll gie you easy recipes for delicious meals,' he reassured the worried homemakers, 'and I'll guarantee that you will not use 1 1/2 pounds of meat per person per week. If we should have to get down to 1 pound a week that would not present any problem to me.' His first broadcast, for instance, included a recipe for a meat dish, which would serve six people for less than 41--a caserole, made of layers of chopped beef, fried eggplant, and tomatoes, and served with mashed potatoes. He's not just talking either. He cooked a full three-course dinner in his New York penthouse a few days ago for six hungry food-company executives. it included soup, meat, two vegetables, potatoes, hot biscuits with butter, and dessert--and cost only 21.1 cents per person. Nobody knows the Mystery Chef's name except himself, his wife, the Blue network--and Newsweek, which has promised not to give him away. He's not just trying to be spooky. The secret began in 1906, when he wrote from New York to his blueblooded family in London and told them he was living in a furnished room and cooking his own meals. That was after his father had cut off his money supply because 'I spent more money in a month than he sepnt in a year.' The family was horrified and asked him not to let anyone know, so he never has. That's his story, anyway, through it's been pointed out that the title makes good publicity--and that he was an advertising man for 25 mears before he started cooking with gas. Outside the broadcast the Mystery Chef spends his time writing a religious book called 'God Answers'...collecting Scottish jobks and entertaiing celebrities: he dishes up the joks along with the dinner He has been married 34 yars, and his red-haired wif hasn't cooked a meal yet."<br>

<b>Epilogue</b><br>
We don't know exactly when or why the Mystery Chef's identity was revealed. The 1945 edition of the <i>Mystery Chef's Own 
Cook Book</i> lists John MacPherson on the copyright page but not as the author. Most folks (except librarians) don't look at publisher fine print. That was
 four short years before the television show debuted. Neither do we know the name of his first apartment roomate, his red-haired wife, or why his 1949 TV show lasted only
one season. Most fascinating? How reporters through time endeavored to convey MacPherson's credentials (advertising executive, chemical engineer) 
without questioning his culinary training. A TRUE Mystery Chef, indeed.

<b>Who was Prudence Penny?</b><br>
A persona created by William Randolph Hearst Sr. shortly after WWI to byline his newspaper's food columns. Dozens of writers, both
male and female, labored under this popular pseudonym. Columns were published in local newspapers throughout the country. 
"Prudence Penny" also hosted a radio show and authored a popular cook book.
<p>
"That [Prudence Penny] byline was coined by William Randolph Hearst Sr. more than 50 years ago, and it has beeen used ever since by
the food editors of most of the Hearst newspapers. At one time there were 30 Prudence Pennys scattered around the country, and

"The most successful meeting of the Monday club year was held yesterday in the Haydock grammar school auditorium, where about
200 women gathered to hear Prudence Penny, the Los Angeles Examiner's authority on home economics. 
The meeting was an open one to which all the women had been invited and the attendance showed that the subject "Homemaking
 Rather Than Housekeeping" was one that held a great deal of interest. Due to the unfortunate circumstance of the stage in which the 
speaker was a passenger, having tire trouble, the meeting was about 30 minutes late in opening but the time of waiting was forgotton as soon as
Prudence Penny commenced to talk. She is possessed of a very charming personality and during her entire talk held the closest attention of her
hearers. She urged the women to systemized their work and make a regular business of it, and run it along the same principales as a 
man runs his business. She also advocated the use of all electrical appliances and labor saving devices. She made the statement that the
woman who said she did not like to do housework was simply advertising the fact that she did not know how. At the conclusion she was
accorded prolonged applause...At the conclusion of the program as opportunity was given the women to meet Mrs. Penny and for quite a while she
was busily engaged answering questions."<br>

<i>Prudence Penny's Cookbook</i> published by Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J. 
The forward is penned by Leo Carrillo [American actor, 1998-1961], not the "authoress."  It is
dedicated to  all the men in the world who like to eat." This implies (perhaps?) this book was not
intended for the average housewife as was typical of the day. Ms. Penny's credentials are noted in 
this brief byline:  "Home Economics Editor of the Los Angeles Examiner. The book has a
decidedly masculine tone despite the fact Mr. Carrillo states "In only one respect do I find this
cookbook incomplete--insofar as it relates to men." The last section of this book is devoted to
 "Favorite Recipes of Movie Stars." Here you will
find Robert Montgomery's Bouillabaisse, Gary Cooper's Pancakes, Spencer Tracy's Baked Stuffed Fish, Johnny
Weissmuller's Raisin Pie, James Stewart's Baked Ham, David Niven's Curried Veal and Arthur Teacher's Broiled Chicken and Philippine
Stew. Possibly these recipes were the contribution of Mr. Carrillo? There are no recipes from
women movie stars in this book. The male orientation of this book ghosts Mrs. Penny's original lecture circa 1920.

Hyman Goldberg</b><br>
"Hyman Goldberg, reporter, magazine writer and author of cook books died today...Known for us humorous style, Mr. 
Goldberg laced two cook books, 'Man in the Kitchen,' and 'The Beginners' Cook Book' with amusing anecdotes. He also made a number of 
guest appearances on television programs with cooking displys and comments. But, as a man who enjoyed cooking--and sampling his
own handiwork--he frequently had to go on diets. Cooking had been close to him since boyhood, when he helped his father in a Bronx
 restaurant. At the age of 16...he decided to desert the restaurant and became a copy boy on the old New York Sun. He also worked
in New York on The Post, and the defunct papers as PM, The Journal-American and The Mirror. On the Journal-American, as
'Prudence Penny,' he did a cooking column....In 1963 when Mr. Goldberg, a somewhat portly man with a bass voice took over the cooking
column on The Mirror, he felt obliged to laugh whenever some waggish friend hailed him with cries of 'Hello there, Prudence.'
'My Friends,' he wrote in a Saturday Evening Post article, 'are convulsed by the thought that perhaps a million or more people 
must think of me each day as a little old lady, presumably a dear old one, while they know for 39 years I have been a cigar-smoking
newspaperman working as a New York police reporter covering fires, murders, gang wars, and from time to time interviewing stars of
the stage, screen and TV. His cooking columns, currently in The Post, were what might be termed fun columns, starting with a joke or
amusing andecdote and continuing in blythe spirit. His Prudence Penny recipe for making rum pie with zweiback crust was certainly
in the vein of Graham Kerr, the Galloping Gourmet of television. 'Break up zweiback,' Prudence commanded conventionally. The next 
step, however, was: 'Keep rum bottle handy; if smashing up zweiback exhausts you, take a swig of rum and resume zweiback breaking
when strength returns.' Another column gave a recipe for baked apples that wound up; 'Keep basting the apples until they are
glazed. If you'd like to get a little glazed yourself, pour a shot of rum or brandy into the apple before serving.' For 18 
years before becoming Prudence Penny, Mr. Goldberg was a feature writer for the Sunday Mirror Magazine, specializing as a girl-watcher,
interviewing starlets, show girls and actresses...A collection of his works, dealing mainly with starlets and other young
women admired for their beauty, became a book called 'How I Became a Girl Reporter.' Among the other magazines for which
Mr. Goldberg wrote were The New Yorker, McCall's, and Cosmopolitan. During World War II he was on staff of Yank magazine."

<b>Who was Tante Marie?</b><br>
Prolific French cookbook author and cooking school teacher. Or not. According to the records of the U.S. Library of Congress, Tante Marie was the pseudonym of Alice
Marie Taride, born 1889. No death date provided. The name authority file compiled by the U.S.
Copyright office identifies Tante Marie  as Alice Marie Taride Taylor (a second marriage?).
<p>
The introductions and dust jackets of Tante Marie's English language volumes (translated by
Charlotte Turgeon) are curiously devoid of standard bio notes. Sample here:
<p>
"La Veritable Cuisine de Famille par Tante Marie, more commonly known as Tante Marie, has been
used by generations of French families. The fact that few changes have been made in the many
editons that have been published bears witness to the fundamental secrets fo French cooking--timelessness and simplicity
...This cookbook is written for homes where one is obliged to consider
time and money. The recipes are given in the clearest and simplest terms possible, so that even those
entirely unaccustomed to cooking may readily understand."
---Tante Marie's French Kitchen, translated and adapted by Charlotte Turgeon [Oxford University
Press:New York] 1949 (p. vii-viii)
<p>
"Perhaps "Tante Marie's French Kitchen," published this week by Oxford University Press, isn't
explicit ad extensive enought for the June bride who hardly knows a double boiler from a fry pan. But
for her whose wedding was some Junes ago and whose enthusiasm for cooking has grown with her
knowledge of it, we can think of few pleasanter presents. The French publisher, Taride, first issued
"La Veriitable Cuisine de Famille par Tante Marie" in 1903. Since then approximately 5,000,000
copies have been sold in France, the Oxford Press claims. The book's first translation into any
language is this one, done by Mrs. Charlotte Turgeon. Now in Paris with her husband, who is on
sabbatical leave from Amherst College where he heads the French Department, Mrs. Turgeon has
again been studying at the French Cordon Bleu. She received a diploma from that celebrated culinary
school more than a decade ago after a year spent in Paris. Knowing French cookery and the language,
she seems well chosen to translate "Tante Marie." The original "aunt" was mythical. Taride, in
preparing the volume for publication, collected the recipes mainly from convents and monasteries,
where they had been noted and preserved for years--probably centuries in some instances. But since
the book was meant for families, not religious communities, it seemd more suited to give it a
"domesticated" title. So an aunt was created and named after the publisher's sister, Marie."<br>

make it. In France, the privilege of making tarts and cakes is reserved for the young ladies of the household. These young

<b>Bazooka Joe</b><br>

"If you're a baby boomer, you grew up with the character. If you're a Gen-X'er, you've probably read a few of the comic strips Joe is in. For those of you not in the know (Generation Y or those who just came back from a desert island), Bazooka Joe is the character and mascot associated with Bazooka chewing gum. The actual gum wrapper is a comic, which depicts the adventures of Bazooka Joe and his friends. Well, "Mr." Bazooka Joe is 50 this year, and Topps, the company that manufactures the gum, started celebrating the icon's birthday May 1. 
The Bazooka Joe character was created in 1953. Bazooka Gum actually predates the character and was wrapped in comic strips before Joe's debut. But Joe was a hit, and when he debuted, the strips became solely based on his exploits. 
Artists Woody Gelman and Ben Solomon, two men who also worked on the first animated versions of Popeye and Superman, created Bazooka Joe, who was originally steeped in 1950s visual sensibilities. Joe wore rolled-up jeans, brown shoes, a white T-shirt and a black ball cap. The most unusual thing about Joe's look was his eyepatch. Why the patch? According to Topps legend, it was to make Joe look "distinctive". 
As with any popular character, Joe needed a supporting cast, so a slew of new faces were invented. They included Hungry Herman, Gloomy Gus and Joe's best friend, Mort. For decades, the characters' looks remained the same, but in 1983, the core characters were given updated looks. Not only that, but new characters Shades, Val and Robin were added. Six years later, more new faces joined the Bazooka cast: Metaldude, Ursula and Zena. The last significant changes came in 1996, when Craig Yoe of Yoe! Studio re-vamped Bazooka Joe, giving him baggy jeans, backward ball cap and a skateboard (but leaving the eye-patch!?). The last additions to the cast were A.J. and Kara. 
The Bazooka Joe character isn't the only thing that's made noise throughout the decades. The comic strip that Joe stars in has taken Joe from travels in space to 
visits from Picasso, as well as visits from actor Johnny Depp. The fortunes, the wacky anecdotes that are at the bottom of every strip, are also an important part of 
Bazooka lore. Nuggets of wisdom like "A penny saved makes cents" and "To err is human. So what's your excuse?" can be found on every piece of gum."<br>
---"Hey Joe Where You Going With That Gum In Your Hand?" Greg Simms Jr., <i>Dayton Daily News</i> [OH], September 29, 2003 (p. E1)
<p>
<b>[2012]</b><br>
"What adults may remember best about Bazooka, however, is disappearing. The tiny comic strip featuring the eyepatch-wearing brand mascot Bazooka Joe that has been wrapped around each piece of gum since 1953 is being replaced.
New inserts will feature brainteasers, like a challenge to list 10 comic book heroes named after animals, or activities, like instructions on folding the insert into an airplane. They also include codes that, when entered at BazookaJoe.com, will unlock content like videos and video games.
Bazooka Joe and his sidekick, Mort, who wears his turtleneck up over his mouth, will appear only occasionally as illustrations in the new inserts, but without the antics and corny jokes of the three-panel strips.
Only 7 percent of children age 6 to 12 are aware of the Bazooka Joe character, according to E-Poll Market Research, a brand and celebrity research firm that last collected data about the character in 2007. In contrast , an average 30 percent of children are aware of food product mascots, the firm said. Among children who are aware of Bazooka Joe, 41 percent liked the character, below the average likability for food characters, which is 54 percent.
Mr. Trani stressed that the brand was not discarding Bazooka Joe, who in the past has appeared not just in comics, but also on packaging, on store displays and
 in advertising."<br>
