<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>What is candy?</b></font><br>
While we Americans tend to think of candy in terms of supermarket and convenience stores displays, this sweet culinary family
offers a much broader and complicated lineage. Food historians propose the first sweets were consumed as a sort of
medical treatment for digestive troubles. Today's cough drops and peppermint sticks descend from this tradition. As time and technology progressed,
so did the art of confectionery. The English word "candy" derives from Arabic "qandi," meaning something made with sugar.
Indeed, the first candies were sugar coated nuts, seeds and fruits. <a href="foodcandy.html#jujubes">Jujubes</a>, <a href="foodcandy.html#licorice">licorice</a> and
<a href="foodcandy.html#marshmallows">marshmallows</a> are a prime examples of
ancient medicine becoming modern candy. Conserves and <a href="foodcandy.html#jam">preserves</a> (fruit preserved in sugar) eventually
became their own type of food; typically paired toast or spread between cookies and cakes.
 
<p>
"All of the peoples of antiquity made sweetmeats of honey before they had sugar: the Chinese, the
Indians, the people of the Middle East, the Egyptians and then the Greeks and Romas used it coat
fruits, flowers, and the seeds or stems of plants, to preserve them for use as an ingredient in the
kind of confectionery still made in those countries today. Confectioner and preserves featured in
the most sumptuous of Athenian banquets, and were an ornament to Roman feasts at the time of
the Satyricon, but it seems that after that the barbarian invasions Europe forgot them for a while,
except at certain wealthy courts were Eastern products were eaten...At the height of the Middle
Ages sweetmeats reappeared, on the tables of the wealthy at first...In fact the confectionery of the
time began as a marriage of spices and sugar, and was intended to have a therapeutic or at least
preventative function, as an aid to digestive troubles due to the excessive intake of food which
was neither very fresh nor very well balanced...guests were in the habit of carrying these
sweetmeats to their rooms to be taken at night. They were contained in little comfit-boxes or
drageoirs...."<br>

1992 (p. 565-6)<br>

<p>
"Candy...The ancient Egyptians preserved nuts and fruits with honey, and by the Middle Ages
physicians had learned how to mask the bad taste of their medicines with sweetness, a practice
still widespread. Boiled <a href="christmasfood.html#sugarplums">"sugar plums</a> were
known in the seventeenth-century England and soon were to appear in the American colonies
where maple-syrup candy was popular in the North and benne-seed [sesame seed] confections
were just as tempting in the South. In New Amersterdam one could enjoy "marchpane," or
"marzipan," which is very old decorative candy made from almonds ground into a sweet paste.
While the British called such confections, "sweetmeats," Americans came to call "candy," from
the Arabic qandi, "made of sugar," although one finds "candy" in English as early as the fifteenth
century...Caramels were known in the early eighteenth century and <a
href="foodcandy.html#lollipops">lollipops</a> by the 1780s..."Hard candies" made from lemon or peppermint
flavors were popular in the early nineteenth century...A significant moment in candy history occured
at the 1851 Great Exhibition in London, where "French-style" candies with rich cream centers
were first displayed...But it was the discovery of milk chocolate in Switzerland in 1875 that made
the American candy bar such a phenomenon of the late nineteenth century."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Sponge candy</b></font><br>
The general concensus of newspaper articles and Web sites place the origin of "sponge candy"
in upstate New York. Buffalo appears to be the epicenter. We find much information about
the current product but scant details regarding the history of the recipe. Many sources
(including company Web sites) vaguely date the recipe in the 1940s. The origins are family
secrets. 
<p>
Apparently this product (or similar products) is known in other parts of the country by
different names: fairy candy, fairy food, sea foam, angel food and honeycomb toffee. An examination of
old confectionery texts confirms recipes with these names. Some of these may approximate
sponge candy, others might produce very different products. One of "signature" ingredients in
sponge candy is baking soda. This ingredient is generally omitted from the other recipes. 
<p>
"Those who know about it come in with mouths watering, cast their gaze across the rows of
chocolate creams and molds to see if they'll taste any today. You see, to get sponge candy at
Stone Brothers Home Made Candies, conditions have to be jsut right. And that means candy
junkies are sometims left wanting for a delicacy seldom found outside upstate New York. "It's
something I don't think exists in other parts of the country," said William Long...Other than
Stone's a nine-worker enterprise...Long knows of only three small companies in Buffalo that
make the melt-in-your-mouth mixture of corn syrup, sugar, water, gelatin, baking soda and
chocolate..."Usually the only place you see it in Central New York is in a retail shop,"...While
whipping up a batch shortly before Christmas, Stone's owner...said, "Some people comapre
the taste to malted milk balls, but it's not quite like that...Stachowicz and candymaker Tom
Wall make 1,000 pounds of sponge candy from early November through April. They make
about 150 pounds at a time in a painstaking two-day process. "Weather conditons have to be
perfect,"...Atmosphere pressure must be above 30 pounds per square inch and humidity must
be below 50 percent in the back shop. Without those conditions, warm, moist air sucks too
many bubbles out of the sponge and takes away the scratchy chewiness that defines the
product...It starts with a 60-pound copper bowl, coarse sugar, thick corn syrup, water, a long
wooden stick and a tall thermometer. When the mixture bubbles to 293 degrees, the copper
bowl is removed from a gas-fired stove and gelatin is added. In exactly 90 seconds, baking
soda is added, turning the mix from a dark tan to a light gold...the mixture [put] "to sleep"
overnight in 2-foot-by-4 foot metal boxes...called "coffins." [the candymaker] covers the
boxes with blankets. Next morning, the "heart" of the mix is coated with a 1/45-inch thick
swirl of wood-hard candy..."It's impossible for someone to make a small batch at home
because the tough hide would swallow the tender core...[the candymaker] cuts the core int o 1-by-1 inch squares...[and them] takes the squares to the "enrobing room," where they are
dressed in either light or dark chocolate...Sponge candy is one of 33 recipes Raymond Stone
passed along with the store, Stone, who started making candy in his basement in 1940, died
several years ago."<br>

There are plenty of recipes for sponge candy on the Internet. This is the only one we found with "fairy" in the title. It is similar.<blockquote>
<b>"Fairy Candy </b><br>
Light, airy chocolate-covered candy. <br>
1 c. sugar <br>
1 c. dark corn syrup <br>
1 T. vinegar <br>
1 T. baking soda <br>
1 T. vanilla <br>
Sweet chocolate for dipping. <br>
Mix sugar, syrup, and vinegar in a large saucepan. Cover tightly and bring to a boil. Uncover and place thermometer in pan. Without stirring, cook over medium heat to 300 degrees F. 
Gradually lower heat as mixture thickens to prevent scorching. Remove from heat and quickly stir in baking soda and vanilla. Turn into a buttered 9 X 13-inch pan. Do not spread as 
candy will spread itself. Cool. Break into pieces. Dip pieces into prepared sweet chocolate. Place on waxed paper to harden. Makes about 35 pieces." <br>

<a name="sweetmeat">
<b>Why are confections sometimes called "sweetmeats?" Laura Mason, British
confectionery history expert, explains:</b><br>
"The anamolies in our own language are due to the origin of sweets or sweeties...as diminutives
of sweetmeat. This word, still not entirely obsolete, was in common use for over 400 years to the
end of the nineteenth century. The suffix-meat has an archaic meaning of food in the widest sense
(surviving in the phrase 'meat and drink'), so sweetmeat simply means a sweet food...To the
inhabitants of Tudor and Stuart England, sweetmeats were sugary foods in general, including
pieces of flavoured candy and sugar-covered nuts and spices, products of medieval theories on the
medicinal value of sugar, as well as dishes which used sugar as one ingredient amongst many, for
structure, sweetness and an air of the exotic...Medieval feasts had provided several roles for
sweetmeats."<br>
---<i>Sugarplums and Sherbet: The Prehistory of Sweets</i>, Laura Mason [Prospect
Books:Devon] 2004 (p. 22)<br>
<p>
<b>Definitions, please.</b> 
A thorough study of this topic requires comparing/contrasting dictionary definitions, literary references and cooking texts through time. <i>Martha Washington's Booke 
of Sweetmeats</i>, circa mid 18th century, is an excellent middle ground/starting point for studies in time. This comprehensive catalog with instructions exemplifies the 
time when British and American confectionery were one in the same. This book is readily available; published as <i>Martha Washington's Booke of 
Cookery</i>, transcribed by Karen Hess, Columbia University Press ISBN 0231049315. Your local public librarian can help you obtain a copy. 

<p>
The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> dates first the print reference to sweetmeats to the 16th century and defines it thusly:<br> 
"1. collect. pl. (and †sing.) †Sweet food, as sugared cakes or pastry, confectionary (obs.); preserved or candied fruits, 
sugared nuts, etc.; also, globules, lozenges, ‘drops,’ or ‘sticks’ made of sugar with fruit or other flavouring or filling;

<a name="candybutcher">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Candy butchers</b></font><br>

The term "Candy Butcher" has two meanings. The primary definition is a concessionaire hawking
sweets on trains, circuses, state fairs, and movie theatres. It was a popular profession for young boys,
who were strong (they had to carry their wares in a large carton/tray hooked around their neck),
outgoing (they had to actively promote their wares to make money) and savvy (spot potential
customers, make change on the spot). Young Thomas Edison was a candy butcher servicing railroad
passengers.
<p>
We also find references to "Candy Butcher" shops. These are less common. 
Some confectioners crafted cheap novel candies shaped in meat forms (<a href="foodcandy.html#bologna">bologna</a> and <a href="foodcandy.html#sauerkraut">
sauerkraut</a>) in the Philadelphia
area during the early 1920s. We have no details regarding how these shops operated or what they
looked like. Were they, in fact, set up to emulate traditional butcher shops selling novel "meat"
shaped confections? Or were "Candy Butcher" shops simply capitalizing on a popular phrase, selling penny
candy of all sorts? 
<p>
<b>About the candy butcher profession</b><br>
"263. Concessioner, butcher, September 19, 2004 - I have a question as to why a concessioner is
called a butcher, at the circus. Is there a historic reason or story?...
Reply: September 19, 2004 - Here's what Joe McKennon has to say about it in Circus Lingo -
"Candy Butcher: Concession salesman who sells concession items on the circus seats before and
during a performance. The story is that the first person to do this was the animal meat butcher on the
Old John Robinson Show sometime before the Civil War. He was so successful, he was able to quit
his job as meat butcher. When others started selling items on the seats they were called butchers also.
When the new railroads allowed men to sell confections and newspapers on their trains they were
also called butchers, 'news butchers.'" J. Griffin. 
Reply: September 19, 2004 - Joe McKennon's definition of "Candy Butcher" in Circus Lingo about a
concession salesman who sells to the crowd is exact. The Webster's New World Dictionary of the
American Language defines "Candy Butcher" as selling confections and newspapers on trains. As for
being attributed to a butcher hired between 1856 and 1860 on the John Robinson Circus, it is a
matter of conjecture. Hawking merchandise such as candies, peanuts, drinks, etc., is like butchering
meat. Cutting a carcass into pieces and putting it on a tray. We must consider that before the advent
of pink lemonade and cotton candy they did sell sausages at the circus. The etymology for salesman
in the 19th Century was "Drummer" which gave us the expression "To drum-up business."
Appropriating a word to give it a different meaning is part of the American tradition in the use of
slang. Giovanni Iuliani." <br>

<a name="packaging">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Candy packaging through time</b></font><br>

Food historians confirm confectionery packaging through time is a complicated issue. Not only is packaging period-dependent (technologically possible options), 
but venue (penny-candy street vendors vs shops catering to wealthy clients), occasion (<a href="valentines.html">Valentines gift</a>, everyday candy bar) and product (chocolate bars are 
packaged quite differently from gumdrops) factor in as well Laura Mason, confectionery history expert, offers these notes:
<p>
"Containers are essential; they help maintain low humidity, hold sweets together, and protect them during transport. Before the nineteenth century, options were
 limited. Fruit in syrup was mostly stored in earthenware gallipots, and small sugar confections and pastes in oblong or round boxes made of thin sheets of 
matchwood...'Jar glasses' (small, cylindrical glass containers) were in use by the seventeeenth century but they are rarely mentioned. They were expensive,
 limited to wealthy households or enterprises. Glass jars probably did not become common until the late eighteenth century when, though used as storage containers, 
their emphasis had switched to a means of display. They include straight jars presumably for conserves or jams, small, stemmed glasses for jellies and larger ones 
with lids for sweets and comfits. Tall straight-sided and later ones with lids are also shown. Glass was used more and more to show off the bright colours and 
clarity of newly fashionable, transparent acid and fruit drops to brilliant advantage in the 1830s and '40s...Another imporant innovation, from the 1850s onwards, 
was the airtight tin--especially for toffee. Functional yet decorative, these became coveted in their own right. Commemorative versions were produced for national 
events, or the patterns designed so that a set of tins with themed pictures was avaialble. Transparent wrapping is a product of our own age. Cellophane was
 introduced in the 1920s and plastics followed later."<br>
---<i>Sugarplums and Sherbet: The Prehistory of Sweets</i>, Laura Mason [Prospect Books:Devon] 2004 (p. 202-3)
<p>
"Wrappers, although treated as so much waste paper, account for much of the colour perceived in confectionery by the modern observer. This is a phenonemnon of 
the last hundred years. Before, a scrap of paper wrapped round a sugar stick or twisted into a cone (the origin of the triangular paper bag) was the most one could
 expect when buying sweets in the street. These wrappers were themselves waste paper. Henry Mayhew recorded how one street-seller of sweet stuff bought
 paper from stationers or secondhand book shops, including the Acts of Parliament, 'a pile of these a foot or more deep, lay on the shelf. They are used to wrap
 rock &c. sold.' Smarter confectioners used paper wrappers with cut or fringed ends twisted around sweets. A French custom of making these up as packets of 
bonbons for presents at New Year is metioned by Jarrin. The London confectionery Tom Smith is said to have commercialized the idea in Britain. His bonbons 
consisted of several sweets wrapped together in tissue paper, with mottoes enclosed. They were first introduced as a Christmas novelty in the late 1840s. Shortly 
afterwards, Smith added a 'bang', evolving the modern Christmas Cracker. The theory is that the idea was provided by a spark leaping out of the fire one night. 
However, exploding 'cracker bonbons' were apparently known some years earlier."<br>
---<i>ibid</i> (p. 205)
<p>
"Initially, chocolate was packed as unwrapped bars in wooden boxes with paper labels, displayed on the shop counter. Individual paper wrappers developed soon
 afterwards. Gold printing and metal foils repeated this luxury message which gold leaf had given to sweets in earlier centuries. Designs used the latest images, and
 graphics publicized the desirability of chocolate. Even more status was attached to special boxes, decroated with pcitures, lined with tissue and paper lace. As the
 package, not the contents, occupied more and more of the foreground, so advertising has shifted almost entirely from the taste of confectioenry towards style by 
association."<br>
---<i>ibid</i> (p. 207-8)
<p>
"Most companies concentrated on indivudally wrapped toffees as opposed to bulk tray toffee sold by weight. They were popular, kept well, and sold at a lower 
price than chocolate while maintaining a luxurious image. This was done partly by advertising and packaging. Robert Opie examined the role of packaging, 
especially tins, in marketing confectionery, and commented on toffee: 'splendid and glamorous tins abounded with bright colours and decorative patterns. The use of
 a tin also enhanced the status of the toffees, making them a more acceptable gift in comparison with the prestigious box of chocolates'."<br>
---<i>ibid</i> (p. 191)

<a name="pennycandy">

The term "penny candy" is an interesting one. Generally, "penny candies" were small,
  inexpensive, unwrapped pieces sold by weight. They were scooped by the store owner
  and sold in bags or boxes. Because different candies were sold for different prices, a
  penny could buy several pieces of small hard candy or one peppermint stick. These
  candies appealed to children and poor working people, who did not have much money to
  spend.
  <p>
  
  "A significant moment in candy history occurred at the 1851 Great Exhibition in London,
  where "French-style" candies with rich cream centers were first displayed. These caught
  on immediately in America, and within a few years there were more than 380 candy
  factories in the United States, many turning out candy that cost one cent (called "penny
  candy"), a price that extended well into the twentieth century. Most of these candies were
  sold in batches or by the pound and displayed behind glass cases."<br>

  York] 1999 (p. 54)

  "Penny candies, the first goods children spent their own money on, were also the first
  confections to reach a mass audience in America. By the late 1830s sugar's increasing
  availability and decreasing price enabled confectioners to profitabaly produce sugary
  drops without the medicine typically found in druggists' stocks. Unlike exclusive
  confections marketed to elite adults, these "penny candies," often sold ten to a dozen for a
  penny, were aimed at the palates of working-class children, for whom a penny was in
  reach. By the early 1850s individual candy men could readily obtain the machinery and
  raw materials necessary to profit from making batches of candy in greater quantities.
  ..Penny candies introduced nineteeth-century children to the world of consumption by
  teaching them to how to be good consumers...Brightly colored and often displayed in
  shop windows in glass jars, penny candies...often came in the shape of familiar consumer
  products, such as shoes, boats, hats, and purses...By the early 1870s penny candies were
  ubiquitious, appearing not only in candy shops but also in tobacco stores and five-and-dimes, and at newsstands and movie theatres. By the mid-twentieth century the penny
  candy no longer existed except as more expensive nostalgic root beer barrels, cinnamon-hot fireballs, and flavored candy sticks."

While candies were sold for pennies in the 19th century, the term "penny candy," according to the <i>Oxford English
Dictionary</i>, first appears in prinnt in the <i>New York Times</i>, April 2, 1893 (p. 12): "The personal peace of mind and the contentment
of my small fry which I have purchased with the outlay of a single cent are little short of collosal. I had to draw the line at the
penny candy of the goodnatured German woman who presides over the treasures of the establishment and insist upon the children buying their occasional goodies at the 
drug store."

<b>[1937]</b><br>
"Mayor La Guardia has ordered the police to put an end to the penny candy 'racket' it was announced yesterday. This 'racket,'
 it was explained, is the practice of selling penny candy or gum to children through the lure of prizes to lucky purchasers. The prizes range
from pennies to pennants. The Mayor, upon learning of the candy gambling, said to be specially prevalent in the vicinity of public schools, 
wrote to Police Commissioner Valentine, instructing him to put an end to it. The police, by the Mayor's direction, will issue warnings for
a week. After that, shopkeepers found to be selling candy and gum of the gambling variety, will be arrested...In his letter the Mayor charged that this
method of candy selling especially 'exploits children who are unable to protect themselves.'...'It is clear that the practice is of
a reprehensible sort which the commmon law and criminal statutes have long deemed to be contrary to public policy.' One method of
candy gambling...consisted of the display of a number of pieces of candy, a few of which have a penny concealed inside their wrapping.
Another gives prizes for pieces of candy with colored centers, white centers bringing no return. Lucky purchasers of colored gum balls also
receive prizes, usually pennants... Another type of candy has its purchase price, ranging from 1 to 3 cents, inside the wrapper. Candy
sold in this way, the Mayor charged, is either smaller than that sold legitimately or is of inferior quality. 'I have conferred with educational
and social welfare authorities on this subject,' said the Mayor, 'and they are in agreement that this practice encourages and engenders
gambling in children."<br>

<b>Refined white sugar</b><p>
"...the Chinese claim to have been the first to make cane sugar, among their many other
inventions. The craft may have been practised from very ancient times in the region of
Ku-ouang-tong (Canton), but it seems more likely and more logical that they learned it from the
Indians. In
fact there is a clear statement to that effect in the <i>Natural History</i> of Su-king, of the
seventh century AD...Sugar cane, a giant grass, is native to India and in particular the Ganges
delta...Indian tradition--and tradition often bears out scientific theories--places the origin of sugar
cane a very long way back. According to legend, the ancestors of Buddha came from the land of
sugar, or Gur, a name then given to Bengal. The Sanskrit epic of <i>Ramanyana</i> (c. 1200BC)
describes a banquet  with tables laid with  sweet things, syrup, canes to chew'...Seven centuries
later, when Darius made his foray in to the valley of the Indus, the Persians in their turn
discovered  a  reed that gives honey without the aid of bees' and brought it home with
them...Eventually invasions, conquests and trading caravans, most notably those of the Assyrians,
spread sugar cane all through the Middle East, from the Indus to the Black Sea, from the Sahara
to the Persian Gulf...It syrup, considered a spice even rarer and more expensive than any other,
was used in medicine by the Egyptians and Phoenicians even before the Greeks and Romans; it is
this  pharmaceutical use that gives sugar cane its species name "officinarum."...Until modern
times...sugar was an expensive medicine to Europeans, or a luxury reserved for the rich and
powerful, a fabulous food brought from beyond the deserts by caravans than ended their journeys
in the ports of the eastern Mediterranean...The Arabs installed the first  industrial' sugar refinery
on the island of Candia or Crete--its Arabic name, Quandi, meant  crystalized sugar'--around the
year 1000."<br>

"In medieval times the growing of sugar had gradually spread westwards. By the year 1000 it had
reached the Middle East and the coast of east Africa. Around 1500, sugar plantations were begin
in the new colonies, notably in the Canaries and the West Indies. Thus, from the sixteenth century
onwards, we can read first-hand descriptions by Europeans of how to grow the cane and how to
refine the sugar cane...Investment in the planting and manufacture of sugar continued unchecked
until, in the seventeenth century, the world market collapsed. The price of sugar dropped like a
stone. In the West Indies, around 1700, there were far too many sugar plantations and far foo
much sugar being produced...This low price was a good reason to experiment with sugar
confectionery, which had already become complicated, varied, multi-flavoured and much loved in
seventeenth-century Europe. The making of rum was another use for sugar, or rather for the
refuse and by-products of the sugar industry."<br>

"...it would not be Columbus of the Spanish but rather the British who would succeed in realizing this [establishing sugar cane
in the New World] goal, and in spectacular fasion. British colonies established on Barbados in 1627 and on Jamaica in 1655 came to be
devoted almost exclusively to sugar production, with the requisite labor provided by slaves imported from Africa. For centuries sugar
had been made by pressing short lengths of sugarcane stalks through a roller mechanism until syrup was exuded. The syrup was then 
evaporated by boiling--one, two, or several times depending on the degree of refinement desired--and pourd into loaf-shaped vessels
to cool and harden. During the cooling stage, 'the emerging 'raw sugar' [would leave] behind it molasses, or treacle, which 
[could not] be crystallized further by conventional methods," but which could be consumed. Proving to be a great deal cheaper
than crystallized sugar, molasses was in fact consumed in vast quantities...In New England sugar appears in the records from
an early date...In the eighteenth century sugar was regularly advertised in Boston newspapers, and it was on sale in other
communities as diverse as coastal and mercantile Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and interior and agricultural Deerfield, Massachusetts...
Seventeenth-century immigrants to the colonies "were advised to defer their sugar purchases" until reaching their
destinations, because sugar would be cheaper there than it had been at home."<br>

<b>Sugar cones & loaves</b><br>
From Medieval times to the 19th century, refined sugar was sold in solid form, often in cones,
blocks or loaves. The standard unit of measure in the United States and United Kingdom  (also
used in recipes) was the pound and increments thereof. 
<p>
"Sugar finally came to the sixteenth- and seventeeth-century consumer in blocks or cones, in
varying degrees of refinement. This accounts for the elaborate directions for clarifying sugar, and
the reiterated instructions to searce (sift) or powder it. (Powdered sugar was only finely sifted
sugar, not confectioners' sugar). Block sugar also accounts for the strewing of scraped sugar that
made for a charming textural and taste contrast that we have all but forgotten.The presence of
sugar in so many of our meat recipes, almost in conjunction with fruits and spices...is part of our
heritage from medieval cooking, which, in turn, had come from the Arabs. It is virtually
impossible to give precise amounts of sugar It is virtually impossible to give precise amounts of
sugar required..."<br>

"Large and prosperous households bought their white sugar in tall, conical loaves, from which
pieces were broken off with special iron sugar-cutters. Shaped something like very large heavy
pliers with sharp blades attached to the cutting sides, these cutters had to be strong and tough,
because the loaves were large, about 14 inches in diameter at the base, and 3 feet high [15th
century]...In those days, sugar was used with great care, and one loaf lasted a long time. The
weight would probably have been about 30 lb. Later, the weight of a loaf varied from 5 lb to 35
lb, according to the moulds used by any one refinery. A common size was 14 lb, but the finest
sugar from Madeira came in small loaves of only 3 or 4 lb in weight...Up till late Victorian times
household sugar remained very little changed and sugar loaves were still common and continued
so until well into the twentieth century..."<br>

"Various kinds of sugar were available in the 18th century, with names indicating either the extent
of the processing which they had undergone or the manner of presentation for sale. It normally
came in a  loaf', of a conical shape...Some of these terms are self-expalnatory, while others are
readily understood in the light of early methods of refining sugar. There were succinctly described
by the great Swedish naturalist Linnaeus [1741]...Here the coarse and unrefined raw sugar was
pulverized and boiled in water, diluted with lime-water, mixed with ox blood or egg white,
skimmed and poured into inverted cone-shaped moulds, perforated at the tip; from these a syrup
trickled down into a bottle; this was repeated, and then the mould was covered with a white,
dough-like French clay in Sweden, but it has to be imported.' What Linnaeus witnessed was sugar
refining...Lump sugar was just lumps broken off the loaf, whereas powdered sugar had been
grated from the loaf'"<br>

"Colonial cooks used many grades and kinds of sweetening, both solid and liquid. Virtually all
were derived from sugarcane...At earliest settlement in America, sugar was used both medicinally
and to season dishes lightly. By the beginning of the nineteenth cnetury, it was called for in a
substantial number of recipes for baked goods, puddings, and pies...To supply this increasing
demand for sugar, the Caribbean islands and the American South became ever more involved in
growing canesugar and refinings its juice for export. A labor-intensive crop and process, the
production of sugar consumed the lives of many African slaves without whose unpaid work it
would not have been so profitable. The primary forms in which sugar was sold during the Colonial
period were white refined sugar in loaves; soft, brown sugar; and molasses. All sugar was boiled
out of the juice extracted from the crushed sugarcane. The juice was cooked until granules of
sugar began to appear in the thick molasses, whereupon it was packed in barrels. Molasses was
allowed to drain out, and the barrels were sent to the refiners or sold as raw, or muscavado,
sugar. Refining was another complicated process, and there were several refining methods used in
the Colonial era."<br>

"...it would be useful to review the various grades of whole-sale sugar as they were designated in
Pennsylvania during the nineteenth century. The following list is taken from <i>Hope's
Philadelphia Price-Current</i> for October 5, 1807: <br>
Havana white <br>
Havana brown (like Brasilian Demarara) <br>
Muscovado 1st quality <br>
Muscovado 2nd quality <br>
Muscovado ordinary <br>
West India clayed white <br>
West India clayed brown <br>
Calcutta white <br>
Batavia white <br>
Of these, ordinary muscovado was the cheapest, just about half the cost of Havana white, the
most expensive sugar then available and the one most like the white granulated sugar of today.
Cheap, black, sticky moscovado or brown Demarara-type sugars were the most common table
sugars used by the Pennsylvania Dutch. Like molasses, moscovado sugar was always in great
demand, even in the eighteenth century, for it was one of the first sugars to be advertised in the
Philadelphia America Weekly Mercury of 1719. Regardless of grade, sugar was imported in large
cones or loaves...Once the loaves of sugar reached the United States, they were usually purged or
refined again and converted into smaller loaves for retail sale and wrapped in blue paper to
preserve the whiteness. In spite of this precaution, none of the retail loaf sugar was usable until it
was boiled again in water to remove insects and other extraneous material. This irksome process
involved egg whites, charcoal, and constant skimming. The syrup was then strained through a
cloth bag until clear, returned to the fire, and boiled down." <br>

"Nothing further requires to be done to the loaves except to dry them. 
The next stepj therefore, whether in the case of loaves, lumps, or titlers,
 consists in wrapping them in paper. The sugar cones in their paper 
envelopes, so as to prevent them from getting dirty, are then deposited
 on trellised shelves in a room capable of holding about 4000 loaves, 
called the stove, and heated by steam to about 54° C. (130° F.). The 
loaves are kept in the stove for a period of four to six days, after the 
expiry of which time they are equalised at face and apex, wrapped in 
paper, tied, and are then ready for sale."<br>

<b>GRANULATED SUGAR</b><br>
Our survey of American Historic Newspapers (Readex) reveals the term "granulated sugar" was used from the 1820s forward. Prior to this time, white sugar was sold in solid cones. The sugar was scraped off and pounded to achieve the desired textures.
<p>
General overview of 19th century manufacturing processes:
<p>
"Granulated sugar. This very popular and strictly American style of sugar was first made and introduced about thirty years ago at the Boston Sugar Refinery. Although 
extremely popular in the United States since its origin, it has become popular in England only within a few years past. The apparatus at first consisted of a steam table 
fifteen or twenty feet long and three to five feet wide, on which the moist sugar was, by an ingenious process or movement of wooden rakes, gradually worked the length of
 the table, becoming thoroughly dried in so doing. Afterward it was separated by sieves of different grades or mesh, into coarse and fine, and barreled and sold accordingly.
 This apparatus was superceded ten or twelve years since by a large cylinder of wood or iron, some four feet in diameter and fifteen to eighteen feet long, slightly 
depressed at one end. The inner surface carries small projecting buckets, by which, as the cylinder revolves, the sugar, entering at the upper end, is lifted and poured
 through the heated interior. The heat is supplied by a small steam cylinder running through the length and center of the large one, and the position of the buckets is such
 as gradually to work the sugar through the length of the cylinder, during which it becomes thoroughly dried. An arrangement of sieves, as before, completes the operation.
 The upper one has the coarsest mesh, to retain the largest grains, which are run directly from it into barrels and branded "extra granulated." The sugar which falls throught
 his first sieve drops into the next below, which has a mesh just fine enough to retain the grains next in size to those before mentioned, which are run into barrels and 
designated as "medium granulated." The remaining  sugar, too fine to be retained by either sieve, is packed in barrels under the name of "fine granulated." Powered sugar
 is mostly manufactured from the coarsest granulated sugar, after it has been thoroughly cooled. The powdered articles, are mostly manufactured in smaller
 establishments as a specialty. Other grades of sugar are obtained from the liquor or syrup which is thrown out by the centrifugul, in the process of separating the 
crystallized sugar from the "mother liquid.""<br>

<b>MAPLE SUGAR</b><br>

 Sugar maples are indigenous to North America. <a href="foodcandy.html#maplenative">Native Americans</a> generally
 credited for being the first to tap maple trees and used it in their food. They taught
 European settlers how to obtain this special liquid, who used it when refined white sugar and molasses were scarce.
 <p>
 "The most important contribution of the Northeast Indians to American cooking is perhaps that which
 falls in the category of sweetening....Maple syrup was the great sweetener, and much more than that: it
 was also the all-purpose seasoner, which for the Northeast Indians took the place of salt. It impressed
 Europeans enormously, since the sugar maple did not exist in the Old World. Father Nouvel, a French
 Jesuit priest, wrote in 1671 of "a liquor that runs from the trees toward the end of winter and is known as
 maple-water." The Indians tapped the trees rather wastefully, slashing the bark with their tomahawks and
 letting the sap ooze out. The colonists followed the Indian example in using maple sugar as their principle
 sweetener; two hundred years ago Americans were consuming four times as much as they do now. One
 reason for the popularity of maple sugar was that it was much cheaper than white sugar, made form the
 cane the Spaniards had planted in the West Indies, until at least 1860...It is conceivable that it is because
 maple sugar was their common seasoner that the American Indian exercised his most potent influence on
 the character of American cooking. It might be argued that the sweetness maple sugar imparted to the
 dishes the Pilgrims cooked under the inspiration of the Indians helped to make sweetness a dominant
 feature of American cooking."<br>

 "Colonists found maple trees in abundance. The harvesting of the "sugar trees" in seventeenth-century
 Virginia is a part of the record left by Robert Beverly. ...However, it is in the North, and particularly in
 New England, that Americans established maple sugar and maple syrup as one of the great indigenous
 culinary ingredients. Nowhere else in the world has "sugarin' off" been important in farm life, for it is aprt
 of living off theland learned from Algonquin Indians by the founders of Massachusetts. From the Atlantic
 coast to Ontario and Minnesota, various tribes traditionally went into the woods in March to make cuts in
 the bark of hard maples and then to channel the tree sap into rustic vessels set to receive it. Indian women
 boiled it down to sugar, adding it to porridges made of ground corn; mixing it into cold water, they drank
 it as a tonic in hot weather. The Indians also used crystallized maple syrup as a seasoning for meat and
 fish dishes, a flavoring they much preferred to the Europeans use of salt. And there is an echo of this when
 some Americans add maple syrup to the water in which country hams are boiled."<br>

"A. saccharinum. Wangenh. Rock Maple. Sugar Maple. North America. This large, handsome tree must be included among the 
cultivated food plants, as in some sections of New England groves are protected and transplanted for the use of the tree to
furnish sugar. The tree is found from 40 degrees north in Canada, to the mountains in Georgia and from Nova Scotia to Arkansas and the
Rocky Mountains. The sap from the trees growing in maple orchards may gie as an average one pound of sugar to four gallons of sap, and a
sinble tree may furnish four or five pounds, although extreme yields have been put as high as thirty-three pounds from a 
single tree. The manufacture of sugar form sap of the maple was known to the Indians, for Jeffereys, 1760, says that in Canada
'this tree affords great quantities of a cooling and wholesome liquor from which they make a sort of sugar,' and Jonathan Carver, in 1784, says
the Nandowessies Indians of the West 'consume the sugar which they have extracted from the maple tree.' In 1870, the Winnebagoes and 
Chippewas are said often to sell to the Northwest Fur Company fifteen thousand pounds of sugar a year. The sugar season among the
Indians is a sport of carnival, and boiling candy and pouring it out on the snow to cook is a pastime of the children."<br>

thickened somewhat, though its manufacture into sugar must have been exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, with the crude
utensils at hand. References to the employment of sap are found in several of the earlier Relations. Nouvel, for instance, refers to a 
'liquor that runs from the trees toward the end of Winter, and which is known as 'Maple-water.'' This was written in 1671, and refers tto the
Ottawas of Ekaentouton. Le Jeune, in 1634, observed that the Montagnais, when pressed by famine, eat  'the shavings or bark of a 
certain tree, which they call Michtan, which they split in the Spring to get from it a juice, sweet as honey or as sugar;...but they don not enjoy
much of it, so scanty is the flow.' Neither of the foregoing refer to sugar, mention of which occurs only in later records. Carr, with 
regard to sugar-making, considers that  'As to the maple sugar...there can be no doubt. It was made wherever the tree grew, and it 
found especial favour as an ingredient in their preparation of parched corn-meal, or as we call it, nocake or rockhominy. Charlevoix, on the
other hand states that the Abnaki, 'when the sap begins to rise...make a Jag or Notch in the Trunk of the Maple, and by Means of a Bit of 
Wood which they fix in it, the Water runs as by a Spout...It is certain that they did not know how to make a sugar out of it, which we
have since taught them. They were contented to let it boil a little, to thicken it something, and to make a Sort of Syrup.' The latter observation seems to 
have been true throughout the area occupied by the Iroquois and their neighbours, although, with improved utensils, the making of sugar
was quickly adopted. Methods, within the historical period, appear to have changed but little. Loskiel refers to the use of a 'funnel made of
bark' which was used to convey the sap into 'wooden troughs are still employed by some of the Iroquois. Troughs were also made of
elm bark. A Cayuga informant states that an  old-time method of tapping was by breaking the end of a limb. The sugar-moulds described
by Loskiel were 'broad, wooden dishes of about two inches in depth.' The crystallizing syurp was 'stirred about in these until cold.' The
sugar was also allowed to crystallize in the kettles. A model of the box-like mould, held together by wooden clamps, was made for the
writer by one of the old Onondaga. According to the latter, the sugar was also run into small tin pans, forming cakes of a certain
weight. The sap was stored, in preparation for boiling, in a large wooden trough formed by hollowing out the trunk of a tree. The hard or 
sugar maple...as considered best, although the soft maple...and the birch were also used."<br>

"The first and one of the most enjoyable events of the industrial year was the making of maple sugar. Each group of relatives or friends had its
own portion of the maple forest, known as it sugar bush. There the birch-bark utensils needed in making sugar were stored from year to
year in a small lodge, near the large lodge where the sap was boiled. The sap kettles were kept boiling all night and the season was a busy one for all 
in the camp. The sap was boiled to a thick sirup, trained, replaced in the kettles, and heated slowly. When it had thickened to the 
consistency it was transferred to a 'granulating trough,' where it was 'worked' with a paddle and with the hands until it was in the form of
granulated sugar. If 'hard sugar' as desired, the thick sirup was poured into little birch-bark cones, dishes, or other receptacles, including the upper mandible
of ducks' bills, which formed a favorite confection for children...Maple sugar was used in seasoning fruits, vegetables, cereals, and fish, being used more
freely than th white race uses salt. It was also eaten as a confection, and dissolved in cold water as a summer drink. it was frequently
mixed with medicine to make it palatable, especially for children."<br>

<p>
<b>Compare with early 20th century maple sugaring techniques:</b><br>
"Maple sugar and Maple syrup:are made from the sap of several varieties of the maple tree, native to the northern United States and
Canada...The sap is collected by 'tapping' the g\trees about three feet from the ground. The tap hole is bored about an inch
deep with a three-eighth inch bit; the spout is driven into this, and a covered tin sap-bucket is hung from the spout. it is the wood immediately under the
bark which gives the sap--the largest amount coming from the ring made by the growth of the tree during the preceding year. The
gathering season commences in spring, generally during the month of March, just as the winter is breaking up and the general rule is thawing
days and freezing nights. It ends when the trees begin to bud, as at that time the sap undergoes a change and the sugar content
decreases. The percentage of sugar varies from 1% to 4%, being affected by many circumstances--the variety of the tree, its location, the
character of the soil, climate, etc.  There are usually three or four 'runs' during a good season and the first is generally the sweetest, 
averaging then from 3% to 4% of sugar. Each succeeding run is generally less sweet and in consequence the product is of a darker
color because of the longer boiling required. The quantity of sap depends to a great extent on the growth of the tree during the
preceding summer and upon the weather conditions during the tapping season. Under good conditions, a tree large enough for
two spouts will yield enough to produce three or four quarts of syrup or six or seven pounds of sugar. After its receipt at the sugar
house, the sap is evaporated in sap-pans and syrup pans to a syrup. For Maple Syrup, this product is starined, filtered and clarified by
the addition of milk, cream or egg white and is then ready for the market. Maple Sugar is made by condensing the syrup until of the proper
consistence. It is then stirred and 'grained' and poured into molds or tin pails and allowed to cool...Maple Sugar makingnow and Maple Sugar
making as it used to be, are very different things--what the industry has gained in facility, it has lost in picturesqueness. The
old style camp with its primitive applicees is no more. The kettle was long ago suspended by the 'pan' and the latter again by
an evaporator, and the trough has become a mass of crumbling decay. The women and children are kept at home and no longer know the old-time
delights of 'sugaring off,'...But to-day everything is 'improved.' In place of a hut of logs is a permanent sugar-house, furnished
with many elaborate devices to prevent waste and deterioration...A scoop or ladle is as anachronistic as a javelin!"<br>

<a name="molasses">
<b>MOLASSES</b><br>
A popular, economical 17th/18th century substitute for refined white sugar. One of the primary
points of the Triangle Trade (the other two being rum and slaves). Well known by period cooks in
England and America.
<p>
"Molasses...as sweetener made from refined sugar, including cane sugar, sugar beets, and even
sweet potatoes. The word is from the Portuguese 'melaco', derived from the Latin 'mel' for honey.
The first use of the word was in Nicholas Lichefield's 1582 translation of Lopez de Castanheda's
<i>First Booke of the Histoire of the Discoverie and Conquest of the East Indias</i>,
which described 'Melasus' as a 'certine kind of Sugar made of Palmes of Date trees'. Molasses
became the most common American sweetener in the eighteenth century because it was much
cheaper than sugar and was part of the triangular trade route that brought molasses to New
England to be made into rum, which was then shipped to West Africa to be traded for slaves, who
were in turn traded for molasses in the West Indies...By the end of the [19th] century
molasses vied with maple syrup and sugar as the sweetener of choice, but when sugar prices
dropped after World War I, both molasses and maple fell in popularity, so that today both are
used as sweeteners in confections only when their specific taste is desirable, as in Boston baked
beans."<br>
---<i>The Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani
[Lebhar-Friedman:New York]
1999 (p. 207-8)
<p>
"Molasses first came to America from the Caribbean. The British started sugarcane cultivation in
Barbados in 1646, and by the late 1670s there was a flourishing two-way sea trade between
Barbados and the American colony at Rhode Island. The colonists shiped agricultural and forest
products, such as pork, beef, butter, cider, barrel staves, and shingles, to the West Indies, and the
ships returned with cargoes of cotton wool, rum, molasses, and sugar. The large volume of sugar
and molasses going to Rhode Island could not be used there, so much of this cargo was resold in
Boston. The New England colonists used molasses not only as the primary sweetener in cooking
and baking but also as an ingredient in brewing birch beer and molasses beer and in distilling rum.
In the early 1700s rum made in New England became an essential element in a highly profitable
triangular trade across the Atlantic. The colonists exported rum to West Africa in trade for slaves;
the ships brought the slaves from Africa to the French West Indies, trading them for more
molasses and sugar; these products were then shipped to New England to make more rum.
Because importation of molasses to New England from the French West Indies seriously harmed
British farmers in the Caribbean, the British government passed the Molasses Act in 1733. This
law imposed a duty on "foreign" molasses or syrup imported into the American colonies or
plantations...The Molasses Act of 1733 and the Sugar Act of 1764 caused the price of molasses to
rise, leading to the use of less expensive maple sugar as a sweetener. When the cost of refined
sugar dropped at the end of the nineteenth century...molasses lost its role as an important
sweetener in the American diet."<br>

"Molasses, from the Latin word melaceres, meaning honey-like, is a thick dark syrup that is a
byproduct of sugar refining. It results wen sugar is crystallized out of sugar cane or sugar beet
juice. Molasses is sold for both human consumption, to be used in baking, and in the brewing of
ale and distilling of rum, and as an ingredient in animal feed. The pressing of cane to produce cane
juice and then boiling the juice until it crystallized was developed in India as early as 500B.C.
However, it was slow to move to the rest of the world. In the Middle Ages, Arab invaders
brought the process to Spain. A century or so later, Christopher Columbus brought sugar cane to
the West Indies."<br>

<a name="treacle">
<b>TREACLE</b><p>

"The word treacle originally had nothing whatsoever to do with 'syrup'. Until as late as the nineteenth century, it was used
with reference to antidotes for poison...It comes originally from the Greek phrase theriake antidotos, literally 'antidote to a wild
or venomous animal'. The adjective theriake came to be used on its own as a noun, and passed via Latin and Old French (where it 
acquired its l) into fourteenth-century English. its ingredients varied from apothecary to apothecary, but usually included, 
presumable on homoeopathic grounds, a touch of viper's venom. Bt the sixteenth century, the word was becoming generalized
to mean any 'soverign remedy', and often had rather negative connotations...The modern application of treacle to sugar syryup
(common in British English, relatively rare in American) seems to date from the seventeenth century, and probably arose 
literally from the sugaring of the pill: the mixing of medicines with sugar syrup to make them more palatable. The
practice continued well into the nineteenth century, particularly in the administration of brimstone [sulphur] and
treacle to anyone with the least symptom of anything...In technical usage, treacle now refers to a cane sugar syrup
which has been boiled to remove some of the sucrose (it has less removed than molasses, which is therefore darker but less
sweet). The famous treacle well in Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, at the bottom of which, according to the 
Dormouse, the three little sisters Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie lived, had its origins in the medicinal sense of treacle. Treacle
wells really existed--they got their name from the supposed curative properties of their water--and there was apparently
one at Binsey near Oxford with which Carroll may have been familiar."<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 349)
<p>
"Treacle, a term in Britain may be correctly applied to various sugar syrups including golden syrup obtained during the
process of sugar-refining, ranging in colour from just about black to pale golden, is in practice used mainly of the
darker syrups, brown or black, which are called molasses elsewhere. Treacle tart is a favourite dessert in England."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 804)
<p>
"When the production of molasses in Britain's refineries outstripped the needs of both apothecaries and distillers, it was
sold off in its natual unmedicated state as a cheap sweetener, Its name of molasses was taken by the early settlers to
America. But in Britain in the later seventeenth century the alternative term 'common treacle' came into circulation, 
and thereafter it was known simply as treacle. One of the first usus to which it was put was the making of gingerbread. Medieval
gingerbread has been coloured red with sanders. In Tudor times dark gingergread was made with powdered licorice. When the 
licorice was replaced by black treacle, it became possible to omit the honey which had sweetened the old gingerbread, and to add
a much smaller mount of sugar instead. Treacle gingerbread, said to have been made for Charles II, had as ingredients three
pounds of treacle, half a pound each of candied orange peel, candied lemon peel and green citron, two ounces of powdered
coriander seed, and flour to make it into a paste. But ordinary folk made do with no more than two ounces candied peel and
one ounce ginger and new spice to three pounds of flour and two of treacle. By the later eighteenth century treacle
consumption was much higher in northern England than in the south; for the diet of the poorer classes now differed
considerably between the two regions. In the north a spoonful of treacle was often added to a bowl of oatmeal porridge, a
dish almost unknown in the south...Treacle went into parkin (the northern form of gingerbread, containing oatmeal), and
into oatmeal biscuits of various kinds. it was still a thick, dark brown syrup...The increasing use of sugar and treacle
meant a gradual decline in beekeeping."<br>

<b>BROWN SUGAR</b><br>
Basically, white sugar (granulated to XXX confectioner's) is the product of the most refined
processes and has historically been the most expensive/desirable. Real brown sugar takes its
color
and texture from molasses. Modern food production methods can also create brown sugars by
adding colored syrup to white sugars. Which brand of brown sugar did you buy? We can check
that company's Web site to find out what they have to say about it.
<p>
"Brown sugar...Less refined than white sugar, brown sugar consists of sugar crystals contained in
molasses syrup with natural color and flavor. It may also be made by adding syrup to white sugar
and blending."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food & Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999(p. 316)
<p>
<b>How is brown sugar produced? </b><br>
There are two methods for producing brown sugar - boiling and blending - and both are currently in use in Canada. 
Boiling involves heating a purified sugar syrup, which still contains some of the colour and flavour elements from the 
sugar cane, until it crystallizes to form a soft yellow or brown sugar. Blending is a process that combines the separately
 purified white sucrose crystals and refiners' syrups (something like fancy grade molasses) to produce yellow or brown 
sugar. The difference in the method used to produce brown sugar should not result in a difference in taste or affect the 
texture and consistency of baked goods. The difference between light (yellow) and dark brown sugar is that the darker 
brown sugars have more of the refiners' syrup ("molasses") left in the product. Turbinado, Muscovado and Demerara sugars 
are all specialty brown sugars." <br>
---<a href="http://www.sugar.ca/english/consumers/sugarfromfield.cfm">Canadian Sugar Institute</a>
<p>
<b>Types of brown sugar & their uses:</b><p>
"<b>Turbinado sugar</b>:
This sugar is raw sugar which has been partially processed, where only the surface molasses has been washed off. It has a 
blond color and mild brown sugar flavor, and is often used in tea and other beverages.<br>
<b>Brown sugar (light and dark)</b>:
Brown sugar retains some of the surface molasses syrup, which imparts a characteristic pleasurable flavor. Dark brown 
sugar has a deeper color and stronger molasses flavor than light brown sugar. Lighter types are generally used in baking 
and making butterscotch, condiments and glazes. The rich, full flavor of dark brown sugar makes it good for gingerbread, 
mincemeat, baked beans, and other full flavored foods.
Brown sugar tends to clump because it contains more moisture than white sugar.<br>
<b>Muscovado or Barbados sugar:</b>
Muscovado sugar, a British specialty brown sugar, is very dark brown and has a particularly strong molasses flavor. The 
crystals are slightly coarser and stickier in texture than “regular” brown sugar.<br>
<b>Free-flowing brown sugars:</b>
These sugars are specialty products produced by a co-crystallization process. The process yields fine, powder-like brown 
sugar that is less moist than “regular” brown sugar. Since it is less moist, it does not clump and is free-flowing like 
white sugar.<br>
<b>Demerara sugar:</b>
Popular in England, Demerara sugar is a light brown sugar with large golden crystals, which are slightly sticky from the 
adhering molasses. It is often used in tea, coffee, or on top of hot cereals."<br>

<b>How available was brown sugar in 19th century America?</b><br>

These notes from 1807/Philly market lists three types: 
"...it would be useful to review the various grades of whole-sale sugar as they were designated in Pennsylvania during the nineteenth century. The following list is
 taken from <i>Hope's Philadelphia Price-Current</i> for October 5, 1807: <br>
Havana white <br>
Havana brown (like Brasilian Demarara) <br>
Muscovado 1st quality <br>
Muscovado 2nd quality <br>
Muscovado ordinary <br>
West India clayed white <br>
West India clayed brown <br>
Calcutta white <br>
Batavia white <br>
Of these, ordinary muscovado was the cheapest, just about half the cost of Havana white, the most expensive sugar then available and the one most like the white 
granulated sugar of today. Cheap, black, sticky moscovado or brown Demarara-type sugars were the most common table sugars used by the Pennsylvania Dutch. 
Like molasses, moscovado sugar was always in great demand, even in the eighteenth century, for it was one of the first sugars to be advertised in the <i>Philadelphia 
America Weekly Mercury</i> of 1719. Regardless of grade, sugar was imported in large cones or loaves...Once the loaves of sugar reached the United States, they
 were usually purged or refined again and converted into smaller loaves for retail sale and wrapped in blue paper to preserve the whiteness. In spite of this 
precaution, none of the retail loaf sugar was usable until it was boiled again in water to remove insects and other extraneous material. This irksome process involved 
egg whites, charcoal, and constant skimming. The syrup was then strained thorugh a cloth bag until clear, returned to the fire, and boiled down." <br>

"Powdered   Finely-ground granulated sugar to which a small amount (3%) corn starch has

<b>Sorghum</b><p>
"Sorghum...There are several varieties of this Old World grass (Sorghum vulgare) that are cultivated for grain, for forage,
and as a source of syrup. Sorghum is native to East Africa, where it was being cultivated around 5,000 to 
6,000 years ago. Sometime in the distant past (at least 2,000 years ago), the grain crossed the Indian Ocean to India and 
subsequently made its way to China. More recently, various sorghums reached the New World via the slave trade. Today, grain sorghums
are grown extensively in Africa and Asia for use as human food and in the Americas as animals. Some sorghums in North
America--like "Johnson grass" and "Mississippi chicken corn"-- probably arrived as the as the seeds of important cultivars, only
to escape from cultivation and become annoying weeds. The juices of sorghums have provided humas with syrup for sweetening and in 
Asia and Africa for the plant supplies malt, mash, and flavoring for alcoholic beverages, especially beers. Sorghum grains are
made into flour (for unleavened breads) and into porridges, and they are also prepared and consumed much like rice."<br>

first cultivated in Ethiopia between 4000 and 3000 BC. It spread thence to W. Africa, the Near east, India, and China, and later to the
New World...In the USA, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, sorghum syrup was popular as a cheap alternative to maple

"In earlier days, no kitchen table in the mountains was complete without its glass cruet of
sorghum. Many poured sorghum on badly cooked meats and vegetables to give them a sweet
kick.. And when the cow went dry, fold would make a butter substitute by micking sorghum and
pork drippings. Sorghum came into its own in colonial America as a substitute for sugar. When
sugar became available in the 1700s, it was very expensive, being sold in cones and sliced off as
needed. Sorghum also was relied upon as a sweetener during the Civil War when Union
blockades halted sugar shipments to Southern ports. Syrup made form sweet sorghum is
primarily a hill country sweetener with a light amber color. Darker-colored "molasses"--made of
sugar cane--is mostly a Deep South product coming from Louisiana and surrounding states.
Applachian people call their sorghum sweetener "molasses," the precise term is sorghum or
sweet sorghum or sorghum syrup. Sorghum was a key ingredient in moonshine in earlier days...It
was during the Prohibition era (1920-33) when whiskey-making progressed to the point where
moonshiners, to meet increased demand, turned to sugar to speed up fermentation of what
formerly had been pure corn whiskey. The smoother-tasting "sugar whiskey"--corn combined
with sugar--zoomed. During the years leading up to World War II, sugar supplied dropped
sharply, forcing moonshiners to turn to sorghum for their mash barrels. The syrup, in shiny tin
cans, would arrive at distilleries by the truckload...There are mountain folk yet today who love

<b>Corn syrup</b><p>
Corn syrup was an accidental discovery based on past experiences with other vegetables, most notably potatoes and
sugar beets. <a href="foodcandy.html#hfcs">High Fructose Corn Syrup</a> (HFCS) is a more refined and sweeter version. Invented in 1967, HFCS is widely used in today's 
processed foods. 
<p>
<b>Corn syrup chemistry & variations</b><br>
"In the language of corn refining, once the starch matrix has been separated from its protein gluten, the starch is converted by 
chemical action (an acid or enzymes, or both, are added to starch suspended in water) into "simple" sugar, called a "low-dextrose
solution." Sweeteners and tecture (crystal or syrup) are controllled at every point to produce different products, depending upon how much
starch is digested by the acid or enzyme...By the same initial process through which the Hopi made 
"virgin hash," our modern corn refiners make glucose, maltose, dextrose and fructose. The larger the number of these long glucose chains
in the molecule, the more viscous the syrup, a quality important to the baking and candy industries because it prevents
graininess and crystallization. Without corn syrup, no easy-to-make chocolate fudge. The more complete the digestion of starch,
the sweeter the syrup, because the rate of glucose and maltose is higher. Maltose is a "double unit" sugar produced, as in brewing,
by enzyme-manipulated starch. By manipulating the glucose unites 
with an enzyme derived form...Streptomyces bacteria, the refiner can get a supersweet fructose called High Fructose Corn
Syrup (HFCS). Today, this is where the king's share of cornstarch goes, becasue this syrup is the sweetener of choice...for the 
soft drink, ice cream and frozen dessert industries. Although supersweet fructose tastes about twice as sweet as ordinary sugar, we do not as
a result consume half as many soft drinks or ice cream cones. On the contrary, American sweetness consumption spirals ever
upward..."The family of corn syrups includes hyrdol, or corn sugar molasses, a dark, viscous syrup useful in animal feed and in drugs;
lactic acid, a colorless syrup useful as a preservative and flavorer for everything from pickles to mayonnaise; and sorbitol 
(dextrose plus hydrogen), and emulsifier that shows up in toothpaste and detergents as well as processed edibles."<br>

<b>Origins & evolution</b><br>
"Gottlieb Sigismund Kirchhof accidentally discovered that sweet substances could be prepared from starch while working at the Acadmey of Science, St. Petersbug,
Russia, during the Napoleonic Wars. Kirchhof needed gum arabic for use in manufacturing porcelain. No gum arabic was available because of the continental
blockade imposed by the British at that time. However, a Frenchman, Bouitton-Lagrange, had reported that dry starch, when heated, acquires some of the properties
of the vegetable gums. Kirchhof attempted to make a substitute gum arabic from starch by adding some water and acid before heating. As a result, instead of a gummy
substance, he obtained a sweet-tasting sirup and a small amount of crystallized sugar (dextrose), a finding he reported in 1811. Because of the extreme shortage of sugar
in Eruope at the time, the discovery attracted immediate notice in scientific and commercial circles. Starch, largely obtained from potatoes, was already being manufactured
in a number of countries in Europe. With this supply of raw material available, numerous small factories were erected to convert starch to either sirup or sugar.  Means
were soon discovered by which either sirup or sugar could be obtained as desired. The fact that neither beet sugar nor any other acceptable substitute for imported can
sugar had as yet become available encouraged the development of starch sweeteners. However, the new industry, after the defeat of Napoleon and the lifting of the
blockade, declined almost as rapidly as it had grown. Sugar became very cheap for a while...Few statistics are available concerning the early operation of the starch
sweetener industry in Euope. But 11 million pounds of dextrose were reported to have been produced from potato starch in France in 1855 and about 44 million
pounds in Germany in 1874...Starch sweetener production developed more slowly in the United States than in Europe, since there was no sugar shortage
here early in the 19th century. A small factory near Philadelphia processed potato starch in 1831-1832. The next plant established in this country to make dextrose
from cornstarch was in New York City in 1864."<br>

is essentially used as a 'doctor' to prevent a batch from graining or returning to sugar. It performs a purpose parallel to that of

it is use oftener as a 'doctor' than cream of tartar. Corn syrup good stand up better than cream of tartar goods; hence the more common
use of corn syrup in candies intended for wholesale business. Some pieces cannot be made without corn syrup, as, for instance, 
caramels and fudges. Honey was formerly used in place of corn syrup in making caramels but it was very expensive to use, and allowed 
the batch to grain unless extreme care was taken. Like all materials the batch to grain unless extreme care was taken. Like all

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Chocolate</b></font><br>
Chocolate is a "New World" food. Food historians confirm ancient Aztec and Mayan peoples consumed <a href="foodmaya.html#hotchocolate">chocolate</a> in 
religious rituals. They did not each this precious substance or use it as an ingredient in recipes. European explorers introduced
chocolate to their home countries. Early European uses mirrored those of New World Natives; sipped as special beverage. Except?
Europeans tradition did not include the religious connection. Savvy entrepreneurs were quick to experiment on this new
substance to expand market possibilities. 
<p>
<a name="colonialchocolate">
<b>Colonial American chocolate</b><br>
Chocolate was big business in Colonial America. It was imported/manufactured/exported in large quantities. American colonies  
competed with Europe for New World market domination. 
<p>
Was chocolate candy sold in colonial era candy stores? Probably not. We find no evidence supporting personal portion chocolate candy (bon bons, 
truffles, bars) sold in colonial American shops to retail customers. Unsweeteened powder (for cocoa or cooking) was most likely the predominant
 chocolate product available in the Colonies. And then, only to the wealthy living in urban centers. One of the earliest
references to "biting chocolate" (eating?) comes from the <a href="foodcakes.html#sadechocolate">Marquis de Sade</a>, 1779. 
<p>
Savvy chocolate makers were keenly aware of
the volatile nature of raw product availability and seasonal production. They routinely repurposed cocoa grinders to accomodate 
a variety of specialized goods, including spices and mustard. We can only imagine how these other flavors effected the 
flavor of the chocolate they produced.
<p>
"American consumers were probably savvier about their chocolate in the 18th century than they are in the modern world. Colonial chocolate makers routinely 
advertised the geographic sources of their cocoa, much like modern coffee vendors do for their coffee beans...Because of high transportation costs and excessive
 import duties on cocoa, Euroepan chocolate was both expensive and exclusive. It was a beverage for the elite and demand was relatively low...In North America,
 by contrast, chocolate was more available at cheaper prices and consumed by a wider variety of people. The quantity of domestically produced chocolate was 
sufficient enough to give it away to the poor. The Almshouses of Philadelphia and New York regularly provided chocolate and sugar to its needy residents, 
something that did not happen in England for the fear of indulging the poor...American chocolate makers routinely advertised chocolate for sale in newspapers
 throughout the 18th century. Approximately 70 commerical chocolate makers have been identified from these sources...American chocolate manufacturers were 
concentrated in four major production centers: Boston, Philadelphia, New York City, and Newport (Rhode Island). Since these locations regularly were engaged in
 the trade with the West Indies, it is logical that the domestic chocolate production also occurred here."<br>
---<i>Chocolate: History, Culture, and Heritage</i>, Louis Evan Grivetti and Howard-Yana Shapiro editors [John Wiley & Sons:Hoboken NJ] 2009 (p. 284-285)
<p>
<b>Colonial American chocolate industry</b><br>
"Another feature of American chocolate was that is was primarily machine-made and purchased in stores. Chocolate histories written from a European perspective
 generally ignore American manufacturing methods. American newspaper advertisement...provide insight regarding chocolate-making equipment and the chocolate
 makers themselves. Since there were no monopolies or manufacturing guilds, there were no barriers to entry into the chocolate trade other than capital formation 
and access to cocoa. American manufactuirng equipment was generally homemade and varied from foot-powered mills capable of producing small quantities to 
watermills capable of producing several thousand pounds a day. Likewise, there were no patent restrictions...Some chocolate makers also produced other 
commodities at the same time. The cocoa trade was tenuous...especailly during wartime. Chocolate makers could ill afford disruption in a steady supply of cooa 
unless they were diverisfied into other commodities. Besides chocolate, chocolate makers commonly ground coffee, oats, spices, mustard, and even tobacco."<br>
---<i>Chocolate: History, Culture, and Heritage</i> (p. 293)
<p>
<b>How was it made?</b><br>
"Chocolate making was hard work. The labor at times intense and at other times tedious...Whether roasting and shelling hundreds of pounds of cocoa at a time, or 
walking on a treadmill for hours, or hand-grinding ten pounds of chocolate a day for the Master, the work was mind numbing. And those working in large
 watermills also had their trials. If the order was for a ton of chocolate for a ship sailing on the next high tide, then well over a ton of cooca would have had to hae 
ben manhadled onto cards, roasted, shelled, winnowed, taken to the hopper, ground up, mixed and molded, wrapped in paper, packaged into perhaps 50 pound
 boxes, and loaded onto cars. This in an age where most of that labor would have been done by hand, sun up to sun down. Chocolate generally was not
 manufactured in the summer because higher temperatures did not allow the chocolate to harden...Therefore, chocolate-making activities started in the fall and ended 
in late spring."<br>

<a name="conching">
<b>What is conching?</b>
"Conching started in 1879 in Berne, Switzerland, originating with Rodolphe Lindt, son of a local pharmacist. Lindt had trained as a confectioner apprentice and bought two fire-damaged 
factory buildings and some roasting machinery from a bankrupt mill to manufacture chocolate. In the beginning, the roasters were unable to sufficiently dry and roast the cocoa, and
 grinding the damp nibs produced a very coarse chocolate. When put into molds, his chocolate developed a whitish coating that was unappealing to consumers. he enlisted the 
assistance of his brother, August, also a pharmacist, to help investigate the sources of the white coating. August determined that the cause was too much water in the chocolate, which
 allowed the migration of fat to the surface of the product. He advised Rodolph to heat his roller grinder and let the chocolate mix longer to drive the excess water from the chocolate. 
Rodolph modified an old water-powered grinding machine developed by an Italian named Bozelli, by embedding iron trought in granite with the upper edges curved inward. A vertical 
profile of the trough resembled a shell, and Lindt called his invention a conche from the Spanish word for shell, concha. The cirved edges allowed fro more chocolate mass to be added to 
the trough without splashing out. At the end of each stroke of the roller, the chocolate broke like a wave, incorporating air into the mass. Rodolph added some cocoa butter to reduce the 
viscosity of the chocolate so it flowed more efficiently over the rollers in the trough. After three days of uninterrupted rolling, the chocolate did not resemble regular chocolate. The
 aeration reduced the bitter and sour flavors and helped to develop the chocolate aroma. Instead of pressing chocolate paste into the molds, the new chocolate could be poured into
 molds. When eaten, this new chocolate melted on the tongue and possessed a very appealing aroma. In this was began the production of chocolat fondant. History does not record 
why Lindt let the chocolate mix for three days. Perhaps it was part of an experimental plan developed with his brother.One anecdote related to the process involved Lindt leaving for a 
long weekend and forgetting to turn off the machine, which was powered by water from the Aare River. Regardless of the reason for the discovery, Lindt realized this new process had to 
be maintained as a trade secret. A separate conching building was built, with access limited only to authorized personnel. In 1899, the German magazine Gordian published a discussion
 entitled: 'Why does this chocolate taste so different from all the other?' The magazine received many ideas from readers speculating on the Lindt process, ranging from using a new kind
 of grinding machine, to adding peppermint oil, eve to the addition of more cocoa butter. Their conclusion was Lindt's secret could not be cracked. Lindt was able to maintain the secret of 
his conching process for more than 20 years and eventually sold his company (and the conching secret) to Rudolph Sprungli. One of the ingredients need to product chocolate fondant
 was cocoa butter. About 50 percent of a cocoa bean is cocoa butter, which has been extracted from cocoa beans since they were first discovered for food and cosmetic applications.
 The Aztecs put liquor into a pan of boiling water until almost all of the water evaporated. They then re-filled the pan 
with water and the butter floated to the surface of the water."<br>
---<i>Chocolate: History, Culture, and Heritage</i>, Louis Evan Grivetti and Howard-Yana Shapiro editors [John Wiley & Sons:New York] 2009 (p. 616-617) 
<p>
"The Swiss were renowned for their high degree of perfection in the quality and manufacture of chocolate fondant. The Swiss production methods were imitated by most manufacturers,
but lack of understanding and failure to pay attention to the details of the Swiss methods often did not lead to success. To make Swiss chocolates, the chocolate had to be bround very
 fine and additional cocoa butter needed to be added to allow the chocolate to be in a liquid form when warm. Conching lasted up to 48 hours at a temperature of around 55 degrees C. 
But for many imitators, by the beginning of the 1900s, it was still unclear how Swiss chocolates were produced. It was first believed that additional cocoa butter had to be added to the 
chocolate. However, high levels of fat in the chocolate were objectionable in flavor and texture, so the melting characteristics of the chocolate were then attributed to the chocolate 
process itself. To replicate the caramel-like taste of chocolate fondant, experiments over many years were conducted to discover the method of imparting this flavor to the chocolate...
Conching was described as an extraordinary process of which the science behind the effects was unknown."<br>

About white chocolate & the 1980s:
"So called "white chocolate" is made out to cacao butter only, but in the United States it must be
called "White confectionery coating," since it contains no cacao solids and therefore does not fit
the legal requirements for "chocolate." It has the disadvantage of a relatively short shelf-life and a
tendency to pick up foreign flavors."

Our survey of historic American cookbooks confirms recipes for peanut brittle (as we know it today)

Food historians confirm professional confectioners (candy, cakes, cookies, ice cream) existed in mid-18th century London. Elizabeth Raffald was one such 
confectioner. Not so much for Colonial America. In our country at that time most confections were made at home. Our research finds American confectioners did 
not become a viable industry in their own right until the early 1800s. The original American confectionery epicenter was Philadelphia. At that time, confectionery 
wares included candy, cakes, cookies, sugar work, preserved (candied/sugared) fruit, and ice cream. <a href="foodcandy.html#colonialchocolate">Chocolate makers</a>
 were a separate trade primarily concerned
 with importing large quantities of product for resale. Professional confectioners in the 18th century (Old World & New) generally learned their trade via 
apprenticeship. Long hours, hard work, and minimal pay counterbalanced room, board and master craftsman hands-on training. For free Colonial-American era
 smart young folks, apprenticeship of any kind was the ticket to prosperity.<p>
While it is possible that some urban centers had confectionery shops during Colonial American times, "penny candy" became popular in the 19th century, during the Victorian era.

Sugar candy (including molasses and maple), candied fruits & flowers (a Renaissance-era
favorite), sugar coated nuts (comfits), marzipan (almond paste), and toffee were all
enjoyed by Americans in 17th and 18th centuries. Period cooking texts typically group candy with
<a href="foodcandy.html#sweetmeat">"sweet meats"</a> or confectionery. Sweet meats also included <a href="foodcandy.html#jamjelly">preserves, jams, jellies</a>, syrups, small
cakes/cookies, ice cream and sherbet. Some of the candies we Americans enjoy today (liquorice,
marshmallows, hard candies, peppermint) were originally used for medicinal purposes. "Recipes"
for these items were often included in medical texts as well as cookbooks. A wide variety of
different types of <a href="foodcandy.html#aboutsugar"> sugar</a> were used to make these candies.
<p>
What kinds of candy did the first Americans eat? Native Americans in the northern regions were
adept at tapping maple trees for syrup. Chocolate began as a <a href="foodcandy.html#chocolate">beverage</a>. By the 1840s, <a href="foodcandy.html#eatingchocolate">eating chocolate</a> was
introduced.
European settlers introduced the foods they enjoyed in the Old World. The following confections

<b>How & where were these candies made?</b><br>

"Confectionery was another art practiced by efficient housewives. It took several forms. Whole fruits or berries cooked and stored in syrup were called preserves. 
Mashed, they became marmalade, conserve, or jam. "Dried" (that is, candied like modern crystallized fruit) they were 
confections or 
sweetmeats. When their juices 
were mixed with syrup and reduced sufficiently to form hard candies, they were chips; when mashed pulp was used in the same way, they were called pastes. 
Strained juices were also used to make jelly, as in modern practice, and there were fruit and berry syrups. Brandied fruits were prepared by adding brandy to the 
syrup in which whole fruits were stored. Mrs. Randolph's selection of recipes, reflecting Virginia tastes at the end of the [18th] century, emphasized preserves--
peaches, pears, quinces, cherries, strawberries, gooseberries, raspberries, and sweet tomato marmalade. Her preserving kettle was made of bell metal, "flat at the
 bottom, very large in diameter, but not deep," with a tight-fitting cover and "handles at the sides of the pan, for taking it off with ease wthen the syrup boils too fast."
 Other desirable equipment included a large chafing dish with long legs "for the convenience of moving it to any part of the room," a ladle "the size of a saucer, 
pierced and having a long handle" for "taking up the fruit without syrup," small glasses or pots of a maximum two-pound capacity, and "letter paper wet with brandy"
 to cover the containers...Mrs. Custis' "Book of Sweetmeats" reflected the elegance and artificiality of tastes in Queen Anne's court. In addition to the conventional
 preserves, she included the more elaborate confectionery that usued flowers and herbs, roots and nuts as well as fruits and berries in a variety of crystallized 
preparations and hard candies to decorate dessert tables...Walnuts and almonds, eryngo and ginger roots, angelica stalks and roots, and marjoram and mint leaves
 were sometimes crystallized. Mrs. Custis also chopped or mashed them and stirred them into a manus Christi syrup, which was dripped into "rock candies" or 
"cakes" about the size of a sixpence. Fruit juices carefully strained produced clear drops and cakes. The pulp of fruits and berries, treated like almond paste in 
marchpane, made pastes in a great variety of flavors and colors: apricots, peaches, pears, plums, quinces, pippins, raspberries, gooseberries, barberries, cherries, 
oranges, lemons. Even more decorative was Paste Royall, printed in molds and then gilded."<br>

<b>When was "eating chocolate" introduced to America?</b><br>
The book <i>Chocolate: History, Culture, and Heritage</i>/Louis Evan Grivetti editor [Wiley & Sons:New York] 2009 offers chapter 26 “Chocolate Manufacturing and 
Marketing in Massachusetts, 1700-1920,” by Anne Blaschke (p. 345-358) & chapter 27 “oston Chocolate: newspaper Articles and Advertisements, 1705-1825,” Louis Even 
Grivetti (p. 359-373). This scholarly reference text provides full citations to all materials. Ms. Blaschke offers this snippet about Baker’s Chocolate suggesting 
the year was 1845: <p>


“By stressing the fine quality and healthful results of…lower cost options, Baker sought to retain the company’s reputation for pure, gourmet-quality chocolate at a
 price that made this former luxury available to all New Englanders, every day. He also sought to diversify by creating indulgent confections that could be sold 
individually at low, single-serving prices. The company's ‘chocolate sticks’ and ‘spice cocoa sticks.’ created around 1840, speak to Baker’s intention to offer 
consumers luxury in attainable amounts reasonable for daily indulgence. His promotion of these ‘cocoa sticks’ speaks to this desire to convey both sophistication and 
affordability: <blockquote>


“There is quite a sale in Boston--by all retail grocers--to children & others--at a cent a stick for small & two cents for large sticks. I learned to make them in 
London, and there as in Boston the sticks are piled in the retail shop window, cross each other, & rather ornament the store. If it be no trouble, you could hand to 
some of your best customers some of the sticks--always to be eaten raw or melted on the tongue to taste; & children once getting the taste would purchase them for 
enough; being much more healthy & suitable for them than Candy or Sugar Plums etc.” (p. 351)</blockquote>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Chocolate covered ants</b></font><br>

Our research confirms chocolate covered ants were a novelty food in the United States in the late
1950s. These
exotic morsels were promoted by gourmet imported food shops as items to *surprise* guests.
Mostly? These critter snacks
appealed to men. The earliest reference in the <i>New York Times</i> is this article from 1956:
<p>

"In case any one wonders what happened to the college boys who ate live goldfish back in the
forties, the
answer might be right at hand. It's possible--allowing for the refinement of the palate that comes
with
maturity--that they have gone one to become conspicuous consumers of fried grasshoppers.
According to
T.G. Loryn, a local importer, more than 150,000 cans of these crispy cocktail accompaniments
haves sold
in this country in the last seven months--most of them to men...On reason for the phenomenon is
that
grasshoppers are accessibly prices...The gag, of course, is to serve...along
with more
conventional tidbits such as fried bacon rind, which they resemble somewhat in taste...experts
agree there's
a real demand these days for party foods that are new, exotic, "different." And once initiated,
many
American are suprised to find themselves quite won over by foods they wouldn't--wittingly--have
eaten on a
bet...As quick to spot a trend as any other merchants, live-wire food importers are now
negotiating for
French fried bees from the Oreint. Fried ants (possibly from Africa) and chocolate covered ants
from South
America are also in the blueprint stage."<br>
---"Grasshoppers a la Mode: Strange things are tickling palates these days. Coming soon--fried
bees,
chocolate-covered ants," Jean Condit, <i>New York Times</i>, April 29, 1956 (p. 264)
<p>
Post WWII fancy food market:<br>
"...travel-nurtured gastronomes, as well as other s who have never left home, are garnishing their diets with greater amounts of
specialty and fancy foods....The adventurous ones are asking...for the more exotic items: Kissproof garlic, snails, fried grasshoppers, kangaroo tail soup,
baby bees in soy sauce, quail eggs, octopus on skewer, canned wild boar, shark fin soup, pickled cocks combs, roasted locusts and
chocolate-covered ants. The fancy food uptrend reflects more than the impact of foreign travel. Americans have more money to 
spend on delicacies and they are reading and learning more about them...A revised interest in good eating has been growing in this
country since the repeal of Prohibition, says Earle R. MacAusland, editor and publisher of <i>Gourmet Magazine</i>
...<i>Gourmet Magazine</i>, which 
is written for connoisseiurs, was started on the eve of World War II and now has over 100,000 subscribers. During the past seven years the
publication has sold more than 150,000 copies of its <i>Gourmet Cookbook</i> at $10.00 a copy...One indication of fancy foods'
burgeoning popularity is the growth in the number of stores which specialize in such foods...Fancy food departments are also 
blossoming in supermarkets."<br>---"Specialty Foods: Snails, Grasshoppers, Caviar, Ants Pop Up On More U.S. Menus," Victor J. Hillery,
<i>Wall Street Journal</i>, November 9, 1956 (p. 1)
<p>
Several articles ensued, mostly in the late 1950s/early 1960s. None provide historic details
regarding
origin of chocolate covered ants. Our South/Central American food history books are full of
information on
chocolate but nothing on the coating of insects. Presumably this particular delicacy was
not a traditional food of the Incas, Mayas and Aztecs.

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Chocolate truffles</b></font><br>
<a href="foodcandy.html#chocolate">Chocolate</a> is a "New World" food originating in South America. It
was first
consumed in liquid form by the Ancient Mayans and Aztecs.  Spanish explorers introduced
chocolate to
Europe, where it was likewise appreciated and esteemed. Chocolate candy made its debut in the
middle of
the 19th century (Cadbury). At that time, it was very expensive and out of the reach of most
people. The
Industrial Revolution enabled the chocolate industry to grow and flourish. By the end of the 19th
century
chocolate was enjoyed by "the masses" (Hershey). Cream candies ultimately trace their roots to
Medieval
and Renaissance soft cream fillings used to compose trifle and fill pastries. Later developments
included
<a href="foodpuddings.html#creme">creme brulee</a> and <a href="foodpuddings.html#caramel">caramel cream</a>. Chocolate-coated
cream candies of all kinds were extremely
popular in
the late 19th/early 20th centuries. 
<p>
According to the food historians, chocolate truffles were named thusly because the finished
product
resembles the naturally occuring, expensive fungus of the same name. About <a
href="foodfaq2.html#truffles">fungus truffles</a>. Alan Davidson's
<i>Oxford Companion
to Food</i> states this candy became popular in the 1920s. 
<p>

"Many who have never encountered vegetable truffles have tucked into confectioners' truffles,
sweets the
colour and shape of black truffles, made from a mixture of chocolate, sugar, and cream (and often
rum)
and covered with a dusting of cocoa powder or tiny chocolate strands. These are, of course, a
much more
recent phenomenon; they made their first appearance in an Army and Navy Stores catalogue for
1926-7."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 351)
<p>
While references to early 19th century chocolate truffles can be found in some books on American food history, it is unlikely
the confection, as we know it today, existed that early. Possibly these authors are referring to chocolate creams, a related confection.
The earliest authentic/historic recipe we have for chocolate truffles dates to the 1920s:</b><br>
<blockquote>

"Chocolate truffles. Dip a plain vanilla cream center, one as small as possible in milk chocolate
coating,
then before the coating dries, roll each piece in macaroon cocoanut so that the cocoanut sticks to
the
chocolate. Now lay them on a cheet of wax paper and allow to dry."<br>

Most people think the origin of cotton candy (also known as  spun sugar" "fairy floss" or "candy
floss") is a simple documented fact. It's not. There are several stories recounting the invention of
cotton candy. All are interesting. None are definitive. Most accounts credit the invention of cotton
candy to enterprising American businessmen  at the turn of the 20th century. The 1904 Louisiana
Exposition in St. Louis is often cited as the place where cotton candy was  introduction to the
American people. 
<p>
The truth? Spun sugar was known long before this time. Mid-18th century master confectioners in
Europe and America hand crafted spun sugar nests as Easter decorations and webs of silver and
gold spun sugar for elaborate dessert presentations. At that time, spun sugar was an expensive,
labor-intensive endeavor and was not
generally available to the average person. How was spun sugar made before the invention of
modern machines?<br>
<blockquote>
<b>[1769]</b><br>
<b>"To spin a Silver Web for covering Sweetmeats</b><br>
Take a quarter of a pound of treble-refined sugar in one lump, and set it before a moderate fire on
the middle of a silver salver or pewter plate. Set it a little aslant, and when it begins to run like
clear water to the edge of the plate or salver, have ready a tin cover or china bowl set on a still,
with the mouth downward close to your sugar that it may not cool by carrying too far. Then take
a clean knife and take up as much of the syrup as the point will hold, and a fine thread will come
from the point, which you must draw as quicky as possible backwards and forwards and also
around the mould, as long as it will spin from the knife. Be very careful you do not drop the syrup
on the web, if you do it will spoil it. Then dip your knife into the syrup again and take up more,
and so keep spinning till your sugar is done or your web is thick enough. Be sure you do not let
the knife touch the lump on the plate that is not melted, it will make it brittle and not spin at all. If
your sugar is spent before your web is done put fresh sugar on a  plate or salver, and not spin
from the same plate again. If you don't want the web to cover the sweetmeats immediately, set it
in a deep pewter from getting to it, and set it before the fire, it requires to be kept warm or it will
fall. When your dinner or supper is dished, have ready a plate or dish of the size of your web filled
with different coloured sweetmeats, and set your web over it. It is pretty for a middle, where the
dishes are few, or corner where the number is large."

<b>Spun Sugar for Ornamental Purposes</b><br>
--Required: loaf sugar and half its weight in water. The best cane sugar should be used, as failure
if almost sure with inferior sugar. This is to be put in a copper pan and brought to the boil, and
freed from any scum thay may rise. When the surface begins to look bubbly it is nearly ready. To
test it, dip a knife or the end of a steel in cold water, and be sure that it is cold, or a mistake may
arise; then dip this in the boiling sugar, then in cold water again, and if it is brittle, and leaves the
knife or steel, it is done; should it cling an be soft it must be boiled longer. When it is done, take
small portions and pass it quickly to and fro to form threads over an oiled rolling pin held in the
left hand. A fork is best to use to take up the sugar. Should this be intended for "draping" a
vol-au-vent or other sweet, the pin should be moved, so that the sugar falls into position, and is
not
handled. To be explicit, as it leaves the pin it is wound round the sweet. There is considerable art
in this operation, and it is quite likely that a number of failures will precede success; it is one of
those branches of the cuisine that require a practical lesson. It is always well to rub a little oil on
the hands and wrists in the case the sugar should splash them, and by standing on a stool, holding
the left arm low, and moving the right hand high in the air, the work is facilitated."<br>

Cotton candy, as fair food, began when W.J. Morrison and J.C. Wharton (Nashville, TN)
patented the first electric machine for spinning sugar into edible threads in 1897. This machine
produced cotton candy quickly in mass quantities. The machine was portable, the process was
novel, the appeal was universal. Perfect fair food. Notes from the original patent:
<blockquote>
<b>Candy Machine</b><br>
To all whom it may concern; Be it known that we, William J. Morrison and John C. Wharton,
citizens of the United States, residing at Nashville, in the County of Davidson and State of
Tennessee, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Candy-Machines, of which the
following is a specification. Our invention relates to improvements in candy-making, or, as
commonly called, "candy-machines," in which a revolvable or rotating pan or vessel containing
cand or melted sugar causes the said candy or melted sugar to form into masses of thread-like or
silk-like filaments by the centrifugal force due to the rotation of the vessel. The object of our
invention is to obtain an edible product consisting of the said filaments of melted and "spun" sugar
or candy."<br>

<i>Skuse's Complete Confectioner</i> [London, undated, probably late 1890s/early 1900s]
contains similar instructions on page 71:<br>
<blockquote>
<b>Sugar Candy, Pink and White</b><br>
Sugar candy is made in a variety of colours. The foreign, which is imported in large quantities,
varying in shades between very dark brown and pale yellow, the prices charged for these qualities
being very little above the sugar value, therefore unprofitable to make, but the pink and white
candy is not so common, and generally command a renumerative figure, besides being attractive
as a window decoration. The process is simple and interesting. Copper pans are sold by
machinists for the purpose, but for small makers a rough coller or white metal pan will answer, so
long as its sides are a little wider at the top than the bottom, in order that the crystalized sugar
may
fall out unbroken. Perforate the pan with small holes, about three inches apart, pass a thread
through from one hole to another, so that the thread runs at equal distances throughout  the
centre of
the pan, then stop up the holes from the outside with a thin coating of beeswax and resin to keep
the syrup from running through. When the pan has been got ready, boil sufficient sugar to fill it, in
the proportion of 7-lbs. sugar to 3 pints of water, to the degree of thread, or 230; then pour the
contents into the pan and stand it on the drying room for three or four days; when the crystals are
heavy enough, which you can tell by examining them, pour off the superfluous syrup; rinse the
candy in lukewarm water and stand it in the drying room till dry. To make the pink, of course,
colour the syrup, but be careful in tinging it very lightly. N.B.-When goods are undergoing the
process of crystalizing, the vessel in which they are must not be disturbed."

In the dawning years of the 20th century cotton candy was also sold in sweet shops and
department
store candy counters. A Wanamaker's advertisement announcing the acquisition of  "A
Wonderful Candy Machine" ran in the <i>New York Times</i> February 11, 1905 (p.4). Price of
their
cotton candy? 5-10 cents, probably depending upon size.
<p>
Bruce Feiler's notes debunking the popular history of cotton candy:
<p>
"<i>The Dictionary of American Food and Drink</i> reports that the item [cotton candy]
originated in 1900 at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Baily Circus, when snack vendor Thomas
Patton began experimenting with the long common process of boiling sugar to a caramelized
state, then forming long threads of it with a fork. Patton's genious, according to the entry, was to
heat the sugar on a gas-fired rotating plate, creating a cottony floss. The truth may be less
romantic, but it is no less appealing. In 1897 William Morrison and John
C. Wharton, candy makers in Nashville, invented the world's first electric machine that allowed
crystallized sugar to be poured onto a heated spinning plate, then pushed by centrifugal force
through a series of tiny holes. In 1904, at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, commonly known as
the St. Louis World's Fair, Morrison and Wharton sold the product, then known as "fairy floss,"
in chipped-wood [cardboard] boxes for 25 cents a serving. Though the price was half the
admission of the fair itself, they sold 68,655 boxes..."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Divinity</b></font><br>
Although recipes for various nougat and sweet meringue-type confections (with and without nuts
and fruit) can be traced to ancient Turkish and 17th century European and roots, food historians
generally agree that Divinity (aka Divinity fudge, Divinity candy) is an early 20th century
American invention. Why? One of the primary ingedients in early Divinity recipes is corn syrup, a
product actively marketed to (& embraced by) American consumers as a sugar substitute at that
time. Corn syrup was affordable (economical), practical (shelf-stable), and adapted well to most
traditional recipes. <a href="http://www.karosyrup.com/history.asp"> Karo brand corn
syrup</a>, introduced by the Corn Products Refining Company in
1902, was/is perhaps the most famous. It is no coincidence that early Karo cooking brochures
contain recipes for Divinity.
<p>
Food historians have yet to determine the first person to call this delicious confection "Divinity. " 
The general concensus about the name? The finished product tasted "divine." A survey of
American cookbooks confirms recipes for Divinity (candy, fudge, rolls) were "standard items"
from the 1930s to present. Some people connect Divinity with southern roots. This is not
confirmed by our cooking texts which are published all over the country. Perhaps Divinity with
pecans is a Southern twist on a national favorite?

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Dolly mixtures</b></font><br>
Dolly mixtures are a uniquely British treat. They seem to be related to liquorice allsorts,
popular colorful candies of different shapes and sizes that are about 100 years old. About <a
href="foodcandy.html#liquorice">liquorice</a>.
<p>
"...it is probably in confectionery that liquorice has found its most extensive and attractive culinary
use. For this purpose, the extract from the roots is combined with sugar, water, gelatin, and flour
to give a malleable black or brown paste, which is tough and chewy. These attribute are used to
gread effect by manufactureres who mould it into pipes, cables, and long strips or 'bootlaces'; or
combine it with brighly coloured soft sugar paste to make liquorice allsorts. These sweets, very
popular in Britain, are of divers and striking appearance, mostly made of layers of black refined
liquorice combined in various ways with brightly coloured paste imitating marzipan. Some lumps
of liquorice rolled in coloured sugar vermicelli. Thanks to the liquorice in them, the flavour of
these sweets is more interesting than that of most cheap  confectionery."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davdison [OxforUniversity Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
455)
<p>
Where did the name "Dolly Mixture" come from? The food historians are still looking for a
definative answer. There are several theories:
<p>
According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, a dolly mixture is a "mixture of tiny coloured
sweets of various shapes." The earliest citation to print references using this term dates back
only to 1957. One of these books, Lore and Language of Schoolchildren, Iona Opie, states
"Other current sweet-shop favourites appear to be the same as thirty years ago, in fact bull's
eyes, jelly babies, and dolly mixture have entered schoolchild language as descriptive nouns."
(page 166). This dates the term dolly mixtures, as they relate to candy, back at least to the late
1920s.
<p>
Just below this entry is another definition for the word dolly: "Anglo-Indian [ad.Hindi
Dali]...A complimentary offering of fruit, flowers, vegetables, sweetmeats and the like
presented usually on one or more trays..." Perhaps this term, as it relates to candy, was
borrowed from traditions begun in British India?
<p>
Another argument supporting the possible connection to India is the word dal, or dahl. These
pulses (beans, peas, legumes) are one of the principal foods in the Indian subcontinent. Dal is
often composed of items of various sizes and colors, thus the possible connection (in looks
only) to the popular candy mix. You can find more information on Dal in the <i>Oxford
Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 241) and
<i>A
Historical Dictionary of Indian Food</i>, K.Y. Achaya [Oxford University Press:Delhi] 1998 (p.
60).
<p>
Laura Mason, British confectionery history expert, says the connection between Indian dahl and
dolly mixtures is unlikely.

<a name="fondant">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Fondant</b></font><br>

According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, the term Fondant (in print) dates to 1877:<br>
"Fondant. [a. Fr. fondant n. and pr. pple. of fondre to melt.] A sweetmeat made chiefly in France: (see quots.). Also attrib. 1877 Encycl. Brit. VI. 257 Fondants..
are made from solutions boiled to the point of crystallization, properly coloured and flavoured, and cast into moulds made of starch. 1892-4 Encycl. Cookery
 (Garrett) I. 602/1 Fondants. This term has become familiar to us for kinds of soft sweets that ‘melt’ in the mouth. Ibid. 602/2 Divide the Fondant-paste into two 
portions." 
<p>
"Fondants are sweets made from a paste produced by boiling sugar syrup and then kneading it until it is soft, creamy, and smooth. The same sort of paste is also
 used as the basis for icing for cakes (fondant icing). The term comes from the present participle of French fondre, 'melt', and is probably an allusion to fondant 
'melting in the mouth'."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 128-9) 
<p>
"Fondant...is a relative recent development in confectionery. It appears to have originated in the middle of the 19th century, probably in France, although the 
historian Mary Isin...suggests that it might first have come from Ottoman Turkey. A variety of fondant which had cream amongst its ingredients was popular in the 
late 19th and early 20th centuries under the name of 'Opera Caramels'. Today, fondant has been reduced to a supporting role in confectionery, largely as a filling 
for chocolates. When used in this way, it is often referred to as creme, or cream filling; this is a statement about the texture, rather than a reference to the 
ingredients. A popular way of consuming fondant in the late 20th century is a mint-flavoured, chocolate-coated form intended to be eaten after dinner. Rolled 
fondant is a type of sugar paste icing...and is used for covering cakes."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2nd edition, 2006 (p. 311-312) 
<p>
"Fondant is relatively simple to make, and lends itself to many variations in colour and flavour. In the 1890s, various handbooks suggested it as a dainty suitable for 
making by ladies wishing to earn a little income, both in Britain and North America...Presenting confectionery as a creative pastime which allowed the practitioner to 
show off expertise and good taste echoed the seventeenth-century ideals fo gentlewomen who could make banqueting conceits. Fondant is now rarely seen without 
a coating of chocolate, and is no longer considered an exciting novelty...Exploitation of fondant and starch-moulding led to a fin-de-siecle flourish of pastel 
confectionery in myriad shapes and colours. About 1900, Skuse commented on 'Fondant Cream Work' that, 'this department has developed more rapidly and
 more extensively than perhaps any other in the business, if we except chocolate, and even then, fondant cream has been of great assistance to the coca bean.
' Ironically, it was fondant which acted as a midwife to chocolate--now the dominating confection. Since 1866, the Bristol company of Joseph Fry and Sons had 
been selling their Chocolate Cream Bar, filled with fondant. This was an enormous success."<br>

<b>Fondant icing</b><br>
Fondant icings date to the early 20th century: 
<p>
"Fondant is a very popular kind of icing. It is a form of boiled icing which subsequently is worked to a creamy consistency. The
formula and method for making fondant are stated later. A mixture of granulated sugar, glucose, and water is first boiled to a temperature
of 240 degress F. In some formulas a small amount of cream of tartar or citric acid is used in the mix, often replacing the
glucose. The sides of the kettle or receptacle in which the boiling is done should be washed down occasionally by means of a brush
wet with water. Care chould be taken not to boil the syrup above the specified temperature. At this point is should be poured out
on a stone slab, usually marble, which has just been previously mostined with cold water. The sugary mass is allowed to cool down
to about 110 degrees F. and is then thoroughly worke back and forth, either by hand or machine, until a smooth, creamy mass is 
obtained. This treatment results in the formation of  very fine crystals of sugar which account for the smoothness and glossy survace
of the fondant. A large batch of fondant may be made up at a time and kept in good condition by storing in a clean receptacle and
covering with a damp cloth. When it is desired to use this icing, the portion required is removed, and thinned down by warming, while
stirring, over a hot water bath. The temrpartue of the fondant during this process should not go over 100 degrees F. otherwise it 
may lose its gloss and creaminess. The desired flavoring is then added to the fondant and it is ready to apply on the cake. On
cooling, it will set nicely. Properly handled, it will not bcome hard and will retain its gloss. APPLICATION. Many of the smaller
pieces can be dipped. For this work, a fondant icing is very good. The fondant, being very heavy and almost all sugar, is 
sometimes too sweet an icing. This may be toned down a bit by the addition of marshmallow, or beaten icing, which also
lightness the fondant and makes it more fluff. Fondant sould be applied very thick and should always be used warm. Cakes as large
as four inches in diameter may be dipped quickly. Where a number of small pieces are made, dipping is a very good method. The use of
fondant is more general on these small pieces; small squares, oblongs, or fancy shapes cut from various cake bases, form the 
foundation for a great variety of holiday cakes."<br>

<b>Plastic icing?</b><br>
FoodTV's <a href="http://www.charmcitycakes.com/">Ace of Cakes</a> show features georgeous cakes draped with a substance they
call rolled fondant. This artful substance appears to descend from Australian cake decorating
traditions, where it was first known as "plastic icing." The earliest references we find to "rolled fondant" in American print appears in the early 1980s.

"In Australia, despite its varied immigrant population, the British cake remained dominant but not in any static and unchanging
form. The major change which has been noted in the British trade in the 1890s had its roots in an Australian enthusiasm for
sugarcraft and cake-decoration which began in the 1950s...The provided competition classes for decorated cakes and in this way
promoted experimentation. A distinctive new style developed. This was based on a change of material. Royal icing was demoted
from its pre-eminence as the standard material for covering and decorating all the more important cakes to a mere auxiliary
for piping. Two other substances to be used in conjuction with it became essential. For covering there was 'plastic icing,' a cold-mixed
alternative to cooked fondant icing, made with glucose, gelatine, glycerine and flavouring, in addition to icing sugar and water.
For modelling it was aversion of the ancient sugarpaste...I <i>The Australian Book of Cake Decorating</i> (1973), Bernice
Vercoe, one of the leaders of the movement from the 1950s onwards, wrote: 'We do not recommend royal icing for coverings as this
mixture is hard and brittle when dry and tends to crack and separate from the cake whe cut', but 'the English still use it'. 
'In Australia royal icing is used for pipework only.' Plastic icing, on the other hand, 'remains soft to the bite for long and 
indefinite periods'...It is also easier to use, being rolled out and draped and conformed to almost any shape; it does not have to
be smoothed on moist and allowed to set. The very considerable skill needed to achieve a fine, smooth surface even on regular
shapes with royal icing becomes redundant."<br>
---<i>Wedding Cakes and Cultural History</i>, Simon R. Charsley [Routledge:New York] 1992 (p. 24-25)
<p>
<b>More from Ms. Vercoe:</b><br>
"Plastic icing. Gone are the days when the knife bent dangerously before piercing the cake and fear clutched the heart of the 
'cutter', wondering if indded, dynamite would be a better substitute to break the cement-like covering strongly defying all 
efforts to slice neatly. The plastic icing and other fondants used today are easily handled, and give a smooth, dull, satin-like
surface which is a delight upon which to work. This icing remains soft to the bite for long and indefinite periods and is use
mainly for covering 'special occasion' cakes of a denser nature, usually fruit cake. Plastic icing should never be used to cover a
sponge as there is insufficient stability in the cake to support it."<br>

Food historians trace the history of dried fruit products to ancient middle eastern cooks. Dried figs,
raisins, apricots, berries and other fruits were sweetened with honey and enjoyed as snacks. These
high-energy portable foods were appreciated by travelers in many parts of the world. 
<p>
Fruit pastes and jellies likewise originated in this region, probably during the Middle Ages. These
jellies evolved into a broad range of sweet treats including <a href="foodcandy.html#jamjelly">jams</a>, <a href="foodcandy.html#marmalade">marmalades</a>, preserves and candies.
Dried fruit pastes (also known as fruit leathers) were known in southern Europe as early as the 16th
century. Recipes for fruit pastes traveled northward to England and from there, to the American
colonies. 
<p>
About dried fruits:
<p>
"With the exception of the citrus group, most fruits dry extremely well if left out in the hot sun and
dry air. The natural sugars in fruit are concentrated when moisture is removed. This made dried fruit
particularly attractive when sugar was not known and honey, then the most commonly used
sweetener, was not easily available. Originally fruits were dried until they had a hard, desiccated
surface, which acted as a valuable deterrent to insects, molds, and other sources of decay...We know
that the ancient Greeks loved to eat mashed dried figs mixed with honey and nuts with cups of strong
sweet wine...Traditionally they are washed with seawater and dried on the ground in the hot sun.
Dates, rich in energy-giving sugar, were regarded by many ancient cultures as sacred. They dry
perfectly in the desert sun and can be eaten fresh, fried, or ground into meal to make cakes. The
Romans also loved to eat chewy dried foods. They grew to many varieties that Lucius Columella,
the first-century author of De Re Rustica, declared they were too numerous to catalog...But in cooler,
wetter England, the climate made sun-drying fruit so difficult that indoor drying with ovens or fires
was the only alternative. Apples...pears, and plums, could be dried whole over a period of days in
cooling bread ovens, but handling them too much meant they burst of split before they were dry.
Instead, apples were most commonly sliced in rings, threaded onto strings, and then hung up in the
kitchen or dried on the stillroom stove."<br>

Sue Shephard [Simon & Schuster:New York] 2000 (p. 40-42)
<p>
"Ripe soft fruits were lesss easy to candy whole. A recipe of 1587 told how to  preserve all kind of
fruits, 'that they shall not break in the preserving of them' by laying them between layers of sugar on
a flat platter, coving them with a dish, and steaming them over a boiling pot. Later it was more usual
to boil the fruits briefly in sugar syrup, and then reduce the latter to a thick consistency before
pouring it over them in glass or stoneware jars...Candied fruits, together with other dry and wet
sweetmeats, were set ont in little dishes at the banquet of Tudor and Stuart days, and thereafter were
eaten as dessert at the end of the second course. They were also offered as refreshments to callers
at other times of day. The dry sweetmeats included thick peach or quince marmelades divided into
separate lumps, punted with moulds and sugared; pastes of fruit juice and sugar, similarly printed;
and dandied fruit chips. Stiff jellies were made from strawberries, raspberries or mulberries crushed
in a mortar with sugar, boiled with water, rosewater and isinglass and sieved. They were boxed and
would keep all year."<br>

"Apricot leather and Turkish delight are among the fruit pastes that have survived into modern
confectionery, especially in Europe, where they are more popular. Except for slight differences in
technique involved with varying fruits, the recipes differ little...In English and French cookbooks,
Genoa is often credited with recipes for fruit paste. Actually, they were much older; the Arabs, and
the Persians before them, had been making them for centuries. In Europe, however, Italy early
became preeminent in pastry and confectionery and quite likely confectioners came to England from
Genoa, bringing the art with them. (The Arabs first brought the art of working sugar to Spain); one
may speculate that early refugees from the Inquisition, who are known to have fled to Genoa, may
have been responsible for this center."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Fudge</b></font><br>
Food historians puzzle over fudge. Why? 
<p>
<ul>
<li>Linguistics & etymology [the study of word evolution]... many recipes predate their popular names: before
there was fudge, there were chocolate creams.
<li>Lore [the study of sociology & popular culture]...the "invention" of fudge is typically attributed to
privileged Ivy League college girls, not home-ec (aka domestic science)  majors. Quite a turn
from most foods generated in the dawning years of the 20th century. Think: <a href="foodfaq.html#brownies">brownies</a>.
</ul>
<p>
While the history of sweet compact confections (with or without nuts) is ancient, the fudge we
Americans enjoy today (especially of the chocolate variety) is a relative newcomer. 
American confectioners introduced modern fudge to resort-area vacationers in the 1880s. 
Mackinac Island (Michigan) is particularly known for this confection.  Early recipes for
home-made fudge are more closely related to early 20th century <a
href="foodcakes.html#icing">cake icing</a> than other
confections. One of the primary differences between professional and amateur fudge is the
equipment. Professionals employed huge marble tables to work their confections into the right
consistency. Home cooks (& Ivy League co-eds) simply poured their mixed indredients directly
into baking pans and let them cool.
<p>
<b>What is fudge"</b><br>
"Fudge. A semisoft candy made from butter, sugar, and various flavorings, them most usual being
chocolate, vanilla, and maple. The candy was first made in New England women's colleges. The
origins of the term are obscure. The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> suggests it may be a
variant of an
older word, "fadge," meaning "to fit pieces together." "Fudge" had been used to mean a hoax or
cheat since about 1833, and by midcentury "Oh, fudge!" was a fairly innocuous expletive. It has
long been speculated that American college women, using candymaking as an excuse to stay up
late at night, applied the then-current meaning to the new candy...The word "fudge as a candy
first showed up in print in 1896, and by 1908 was commonly
associated with women's colleges, as in "Wellesley Fudge,"..."Divinity fudge" with egg whites
and often, candied cherries, came along about 1910 and was especially popular during the
holidays. The name probably referred to its "divine" flavor."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar Friedman:New
York] (p. 135)
[NOTE: The Irish recipe for "fadge" makes an apple potato cake. It was traditionally served on
the feast of Samhain (Halloween).]
<p>
"The addition of dairy products [to <a href="foodcandy.html#tablet">Scottish tablet</a>] was a development which contributing more
than must flavour...This is exploited by fudge, a confection which relies on similar ingredients
and principles to tablet, but is richer, softer and requires a slightly lower temperature. On
first tasting, the similarities seem overwhelming, both in flavour...and general textures. It is easy
to assume that they share a common origin; but the derivation of the name fudge and the origins
of the sweet are both obscure. Fudge as now understood seems to have travelled east to Britain
from North America. Anecdotal evidence links it to women's colleges in the laste nineteenth
century, and most early recipes include chocolate. It is possible that Scottish migrants took the
idea of milk-based tablet to North America. Whether these were influenced by fudge-like
mixtures of brown sugar and nuts from Creole cuisine of the southern states is unclear. Fudge
appears to have been taken up by confectioners and large companies some years later.
Skuse, who actively collected formulae, including North American ones, did not give one for
fudge in the early editions of his <i>Confectioners Handbook</i>, but recipes first appear in
British books in the first decade of this century."<br>
---<i>Sugar-Plums and Sherbet: The Prehistory of
Sweets</i>, Laura Mason [Prospect Books:Devon] 2004(p. 72)
<p>
"Fudge, which denotes a sort of soft, somewhat toffee-like sweet made by boiling together sugar,
butter, and milk, is a mystery word. It first appeared, in the USA, at the end of the nineteenth
century, when it was used for  a kind of chocolate bonbon', and by 1902 the journal <i>The
Queen</i> was recording that the greatest "stunt" among college students is to make
<i>Fudge</i>. It is generally assumed to have been an adaptation of the verb <i>fudge</i>, in the
sense  make inexpertly, botch. But this merely begs the question, as the origin of the verb, too,
is uncertain."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 133)
<p>
It is quite likely enterprising co-eds found "alternative" ways to melt store-bought
chocolate/cocoa  (Baker's, Hershey's), adding whatever ingredients they had on hand, to
approximate the semi-soft, delicious confections they tasted on family holiday. Their concoctions
probably tasted pretty good. Where there's a will, there's a way.

with those below for "fudge":<br>

<b>[1884] Chocolate Caramels</b><br>

"Vassar girls not only indulge freely in 'sweets' of every known variety, but they get up new recipes whenever their sated
palats demand a change. The following is the reicpe for 'fudge,' the latest confectionery dainty:<br>
Two cups of sugar, one cup of milk, a piece of butter one-half the size of an egg, and a teaspoonful of vanilla extract. The
mixture is cooked until it begins to get grimy. Then it is taken from the fire, stirred briskly and turned into buttered tins.
Fudge may be eaten hot or cold, but it is never so truly delicious as when, at the witching hour of midnight, it is first removed
from the gas jet or alcohol lamp and served on bits of cardboard, or portions of a manicure set, bubbling hot, to a group of

"The name fudge is applied to a large group of candies made of sugar boiled with water, milk, or
cream, from 230 degrees F. To 238 degrees F., and stirred or worked with a paddle until candy
becomes firm. If stirred while still hot, the resulting candy is coarse and granular. To prevent this,
the syrup should be cooled in the saucepan in which it is cooked, or poured out upon a marble
slab, platter, or agate tray that has been slightly moistened with a piece of wet cheesecloth. It
should not be disturbed until cool. It should then be stirred with a wooden spoon, or worked with
a spatula forward and lifting up the mass, turning it over and bringing it back, until the whole
begins to get stiff. At this stage, turn into a pan, or, better still, leave the candy between bars on
wax paper on a board, regulating the size of the open space according to the amount of candy and
the thickness desired."<br>

the recipe was printed on the back of the can periodically from the

"Kissing comfits , as detailed by Robert May in 1685, were sugar paste containg musk, civet, ambergris, and orris powder. 
These were printed in moulds or rolled 
into little pellets and then squeezed flat with a seal...The combination of sugar and mottoes continued, Hannah Glasse gave instructions 'to make little things of sugar,
 with devices in them. These were made from the pieces of sugar paste, tinted whatever colour was preferred, 'in what shapes you like...in the middle of them have
 little pieces of paper, with some pretty smart sentences wrote on them; they will in company make much mirth.' But the writing migrated from paper to the sweet
 itself with the Victorian fashion for 'conversation lozenges'. Those who were tongue-tied could always offer their companion a little piece of sugar paste printed
 with some suitable inscription. 'How do you flirt?' "Can you polka?' and 'Love me' were amongst those available from Terry's in York; for those wanting to make a
 really positive response, a large medallion moulded with a heart and the words 'I will' was available. Another novelty was reminiscent of Hannah Glasse's little 
things with devices in them. As advertised by the firm of Thomas Handisyde in the East End of London, these were 'Handisydes Secret Charms suck carefully and 
the secret message will appear'. Handisyde produced various shapes and sizes of conversation lozenges, the larger ones cut in hearts, circles, and elegant oblongs
 with ogee edges. The temperance movement used the idea of motto lozenges to promote their message. 'Drink is the ruin of man'...The inscriptions were added to
 the sweets by printing the tops with stamps dipped in dyes." <br>

<b>Opera fudge</b><br>

Opera fudge is one of many delicious culinary specialties connected with Lebanon, PA. This
fondant candy is a seasonal treat, traditionally made from Thanksgiving to Easter (it melts in the
hotter months). In other parts of the country these candies are called opera drops [Boston], french creams, and opera 
caramels. Cincinnati's famous <a href="foodcandy.html#operacreams">Opera Creams</a> are a chocolate-coated fondant. 
<p>
<b>Why "opera?"</b><br>
There are several theories explaining why these candies are connected to the opera, none of them
conclusive:

<p>
"Rueppel isn't sure why it's called opera fudge but doesn't think it has anything to do with fat
ladies, at least not the singing kind. ''I think it's because it's a real rich fudge,'' Rueppel said. ''The
opera is something rich - at the top - like opera fudge.'' <br>
---"Sugarm Cream, Chocolate--Of Course It's Good," Steve Stephens, The
<i>Columbus Dispatch</i>, February 28, 1994 (p. 8c)

"Opera drops were chocolates with vanilla cream filling, kind of conical, haystack shaped. You
would by them at intermission at the opera. There was a British brand called Between the Acts
that you could buy at Bailey's in Boston."<br>

<p>
The name "opera" seems indeed to be a 20th century invention, evidenced by the fact that <i>Skuse's Complete Confectioner</i> [an important industry text, London: 1898?] makes no
reference to them. Skuse's also does not use the word "fudge."

<b>Opera creams, Cincinnati style</b><br>
There is no question confections called "Opera Creams" are a Cincinnati specialty, extending to southern Illinois and western
Pennsylavania. Our culinary history sources confirme these confections existed in the early 20th century but do not specifically credit Papas (or any other person/place) 
with the invention of this candy. In fact, most foods are not invented. They evolve. Why are they called <a href="foodcandy.html#operafudge">"Opera?"</a>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Gibraltar rock</b></font><br>
Gibraltar (aka Gibraltar Rock) descends from ancient Arab boiled sugar confectionery.
Losenges, penides, sticks (peppermint & fruit), drops and <a href="foodcandy.html#lollipops">lollipops</a> are popular examples
of this confectionery family. According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>
confections called Gibraltar date in print to 1831.  This is curious, since we find conflicting
evidence suggesting this product existed in the 17th century.  Indeed, modern hard candies, as
we know them today, were first produced in the 17th century.
<p>
The connection between professionally manufactured candy products and military campaigns is
an interesting and persistent phenomenon. Gibraltar Rock took its name from the Battle of
Gibraltar, 1607. During World War II, American confectionery companies were crafted
hard candies shaped like guns, soldiers and tanks.

another kind of sweetmeat, in which the sugar whilst hot and soft is repeatedly pulled over a
smooth iron hook, until it becomes white and pourous. This rock is flavored in various ways."<br>

"William Finemore also detailed many pulled-sugar recipes, several of which showed the

major naval centre; desire for identificaiton with national heroes must have been particulalry
strong amongst small boys in the area.  Wellington Sticks' were striped red, blue and yellow;
"Buonaparte's ribs' were striped sweets cut in sticks and flattened.  Gibraltar rock' and  North
Pole' were very complex, made from sugar which was divided into batches, some coloured red
and some plain, some pulled and some left clear, assembled in patterns, pulled out and cut; the
resulting sticks were then put together in a bundle, cased with more sugar nad pulled out again.

stripes, lemon or mint rock, Nelsons Balls, pink or white  pellets' and artful pieces of pulled,
patterned sugar, requiring skills which could have just as easily been used to make letters...By
the nineteenth century, flavours were used. According to Mayhew, in London during the 1850s:

ate Gibraltar, but you might smear yourself with Black Jack. Gibraltar was not precisely
conservative; it changed as to its flavors, so once a charming old Salem Dame said: "I known I

Food historians tell us halva (halvah, hulwa) is an ancient confection originating in the Middle
East. 
<br>
"Halva. Name of a hugely varied range of confections made in the Middle East, Central Asia, and
India, derived from the Arabic root hulw, sweet. In 7th century Arabia, the word meant a paste of
dates kneaded with milk. By the 9th century, possibly by assimilating the ancient Persian
sweetmeat afroshag, it had acquired a meaning of wheat flour or semolina, cooked by frying or
toasting and worked into a more or less stiff paste with a sweetening agent such as sugar syrup,
date syrup, grape syrup, or honey by stirring the mass together over a gentle heat. Usually a
flavouring was added such as nuts, rosewater, or pureed cooked carrots (still a popular
flavouring). The finished sweetmeat would be cut into bars or moulded into fanciful shapes such
as fish. Halva spread both eastwards and westwards, with the result that is is made with a wide
variety of ingredients, methods, and flavourings..."<br>

"One...Muslim innovation that spread through the subcontinent [India] with remarkable speed--an
addition to sweetmeats. Just as Spain had learned of marzipan and nougat from the Arabs, so
India discovered the delights of sugar candy. (The word  candy' is derived from the Arabic for
sugar.) Confections of all kinds, made from sugar alone, from sugar and almonds, from sugar and
rice flour, from sugar and coconut, became immensely popular as did sweet desserts such as
halwa...Muglai halwa probably resembled modern halva--based on pureed vegetables or grain,

halvah is still associated with Jewish delicatessens, even though one of the most popular

kinds of horehound, black, which he approves more, and white. From either, when they are chopped fine and mixed with flour, tidbits
are made which we eat for health at the first course, after they have been fried in oil in a pan. They are believed to get rid
of worms, and for this reason they are often served to children."<br>

The origin and evolution of sweet fruit jelly, jams and preserves if fascinating. We are also including our notes on savory jelly (calve's & isinglass). If you need more information please let us know! 
The primary differences between these items are the texture of the product and the method of manufacture. 
Jam contains small chunks of fruit, jelly is almost perfectly smooth, preserves contain large chunks or whole pieces of 
fruit. Sweet jelly requires fruit juice with a *jelling* agent (<a href="foodfaq.html#isinglass">isinglass</a>, calves foot, gelatine powder). Jam and 
preserves are basically real fruit preserved in sugar. Definitions and products have changed over time. Gelatin is a much 
broader and more complicated topic, as the ingredients have also changed through time. Savory jellies (most notably 
<a href="foodfaq.html#aspic">aspic</a>)
proliferated from Medieval times to the early 20th century. These notes concentrate on sweet products. 
<p>
<b>Modern definitions:</b><br>
"The word "jelly" derives from the Middle English, geli, and ultimately from the Latin gelare, "to freeze."..."Jam" 
differs from jelly in being made with fresh or dried fruit rather than juice and has a thicker texture..."Preserves" 
differ from jams and jellies by containing pieces of the fruit." <br>

<a name="jam">
<b>Jam, preserves & conserves</b><br> 
"Jam remains one of the unsolved mysteries of culinary etymologies. No conclusive evidence has 
been found for the origin of the word, but most authorities agree that the likeliest explanation is 
that it describes the way jam is made by crushing or jamming' fruit together. Two early 
references seem to support this: first Hannah Glasse in her <i>Art of Cookery</i> (1747), using a 
curious Italianate spelling: "To make Raspberry Giam."...The word begins to emerge in the 
1730s; the first record of it is in the <i>Dictionarium Britannicum</i> (1736) of Nathan Baily, who 
essays a fanciful derivation from the French j'aime, (I love it', on the ground that that was what 
children used to day...formerly, when they liked any Thing'. Before that, other words used for 
fruits (and other parts of plants, such as flowers) preserved in sugar included conserva, a 
borrowing from Italian or medieval Latin, first recorded in 1502, comfiture (1558), and the still 
current conserve (1530) and preserve (1600). Nowadays we take jam with bread as a matter of 
course, but until comparatively recently it was a luxury...Up until the nineteenth century, fruit 
preserves might just as often be eaten on their own, as a dessert, or as a filling for tarts..."<br> 
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford Univeristy Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 170-1) 
<p>
"Jam, a mixture of fruit and sugar boiled together, poured into jars, and sealed to give a long-keeping preserve with a wet semi-solid consistence, known to a food scientist as a gel. Jams, and 
related preserves such as fruit pastes, jellies, and marmalades are based on widespread and 
ancient methods of preserving fruit. Similar confections are made throughout Europe and the 
Middle East. Successful jam depends on the interaction of three things in the correct proportions: 
sugar, pectin (long chainlike molecules occurring in the cell walls of plants), acid. Fruit contains 
all of these, but the jam-maker always adds more sugar, and sometimes pectin and acid." <br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 412-3) <br>

<p>
"The earliest kind of jam making...dates back to pre-Roman times, when fruit pulp was mixed 
with honey and spices and dried in the sun. In the first century AD, Greeks made a preserve, 
using 
their abundant crops of quinces, by stuffing pieces of peeled and pipped raw fruit tightly into jars 
filled with honey. After a year the fruit became soft as wine-honey'. This Greek quince preserve 
was called melomeli' (apple: melo, in honey: meli). The Romans later reversed the words into 
melimela' and improved the preserve by cooking the fruit in the honey with pepper and spices 
and sealing the jars to make them airtight. Quinces had a high pectin content so that when 
cooked, preserves made with them would have had a very solid texture. Pectin is a vital 
ingredient 
for successful jelly and jam making... 
By the 17th century...cane sugar was more readily available, and preserving fruit with sugar 
became an affordable option. Recipes that previously used honey were easily adapted...The 
English had their own particular version that included pieces of warden pear, but seemed to 
prefer 
the Portuguese quince preserve. Using their sugar from India and their abundance of quinces, the 
Portuguese had developed their own specialty, which they called marmelada' (like the Roman 
melimela')...As early as the sixteenth century, little chests of marmelada were included in the 
cargoes of Portuguese merchant ships arriving in English ports. Gradually the same process was 
applied to other fruits, which then came to be known as a marmalade' of pears, damsons, or 
plums..." <br>

<b>Jelly (fruit) </b><br>
The fundamentals jellying process was known in ancient times. These techniques migrated from the Middle West to 
Europe with Crusaders and evolved with technological advancements and new ingredients.
<p>
"The history of jelly, chronicled by Brears (1996)...is complex. Generally, it would seem that 
confectionery type jellies, and jelly preserves, developed from attempts to conserve pectin-rich 
fruit extracts...Modern dessert jellies, on the other hand, appear to be descended from medieval 
dishes based on calves' feet or other meat stocks, carefully clarified and flavoured. A wide range 
of gelling or setting agents was known to medieval cooks. The animal kingdome was represented 
by gelatin in the form of meat stock, isinglass, and hartshorn. Plants provided pectin-rich juices 
from quinces or apples; and various kinds of gum...Late medieval and 16th-century cooks made 
savoury (or savoury/sweet--many had an ambivalent character) jellied dishes using meat such as 
capon, chopped fine, mixed with cream or almond milk, flavoured with spices, sugar, or 
rosewater. These were known as cullis, gellys, or brawn. Another 'set' dish was a leach, made 
from cream or almond milk with isinglass. A sweet crystall gelly' was made with calves' feet 
stock, highly spices (ginger, pepper, cloves, nutmeg), sweetened, and further flavoured with 
rosewater. These dishes, which are recorded in early 17th-century cookery books...were ancestors 
of sweet confections such as blancmange as well as of the explicitly savoury aspic dishes which 
proliferated in the 19th and early 20th centuries." <br>

<a name="gelatine">
<b>Commercial gelatins</b><br>
The manufacture of food-grade gelatin (aka gelatine) traces back to the 18th century. Denys Papin's Digester machine 
was the forerunner of the modern pressure cooker. One of the items he experimented on was gelatin-based 
<a href="foodsoups.html#portable">portable soup</a>. The first modern American patent was granted to Peter Cooper, in 1845. Mr. Cooper 
did not set out purposely to *discover* dessert gelatine. He was more interested in glue. 
<p>
"In 1754, the first English patent for the manufacture of gelatin was granted...Unflavored, dried gelatin 
became available in 1842 from the J and G Company of Edinburgh, Scotland...In America, in 1845, Peter 
Cooper, inventor of the steam locomotive, secured a patent for a gelatin dessert powder called Portable 
Gelatin, requiring only the addition of hot water. The same year, the J and G Company began exporting its 
Cox Gelatin to the United States. The new formulas never gained much popularity, however, and as late 
as 1879 when the classic <i>Housekeeping in Old Virginia</i> was published, editor Marion Cabell Tyree, while 
admitting that jelly made of calves and hogs was "more troublesome," claimed it was more nutritious than 
Cox's or Nelson's desiccated formulas. Plymouth Rock Gelatin Company of Boston patented its Phosphated 
Gelatin in 1889. In 1894, Charles Knox introduced granulated gelatin, making the brand something of a 
household word. This opened the way for the plethora of American recipes that gained popularity..." <br>

Volume 2 (p. 104-5) 
<p>
"[Peter] Cooper took out the first U.S. U.S. patent for a gelatin dessert in 1845. It described "a transparent 
concentrated or solidified jelly containing all the ingredients fitting it for table use...and requiring only the 
addition of a prescribed quantity of hot water to dissolve it."...Cooper also invented a gelatin "eagle" to help 
time the gelatin-making process...Knox, Cox (of Scotland), and other companies were already making 
other kinds of convenience gelatin products. But sheet and shredded gelatin still had to be soaked, and 
sometimes cooked and strained as well." <br>

Jelly beans belong to the culinary family of <a href="foodcandy.html#jellyjam">fruit jellies</a>. These sweet confections have long been enjoyed as jams, jellies, 
conserves, and preserves. Fruit gums, leathers and decorative chewy slices are natural iterations along this culinary theme.
Food historians generally agree jelly beans, as we know them today, descended from <a href="foodcandy.html#turkishdelight">Turkish 
Delight</a>, a fruit-gum confection
originating in the Middle East. These were very popular from the mid-19th century forwards. Laura Mason, British confectionery expert, 
credits the USA for developing jelly beans. To date, we find no particular person, place or company claiming to have invented the first
"jelly bean." 
<p>
"[in the 16th century]The majority of these fruit sweetmeats were available in two guises. They could be wet, swimming in rich syrup, stored in jars 
and eaten with a spoon or (later) fork. Or they could be dry, in lumps or little chips, coated in sugar and kept in boxes between
thick sheets of paper...There were other fruit sweets devised in the medieval period, the ancestors of multi-coloured modern
fruit jellies. The names for these sweets make them sound more like breakfast or teatime delicacies, but it is necessary to 
forget the modern meanings of these words for a moment. Take marmalade. Today, this is a jam-like condiment made of oranges and
sugar, semi liquid and flecked with strips fo peel...But the name is derived from the medieval Portuguese marmelada, a stiff
paste that was cut in slices rather than spread. The word derives from the Portuguese marmelo, or quince, since this fragrant
yet knobbly item was originally the favoured fruit for preserving, and it became the term used by the mid sixteenth century
to describe all kinds of fruits preserves, not glutinous and syrupy as they are today, but stiff enought to be made into 
individual sweets if so desired...It is possible that the technique of naking thse marmalades and other conserves, by boiling up
equal amounts of fruit pulp and sugar in water, was inherited from the Levant, where confectioners were skilled at melding fruit with
sugar largely because of the ubiquity of sherbet...The main ingredients of sherbet were sugar syrup or sugar candy--in Turkey
a dark pink substance called gul sekeri--and any one of scores of fruit juices and pulots...However, a seventeethn-century visitor
to Turkey described this base sherbet flavour not as a liquid but as a type of fruit paste. And Francis Bacon, writing in 1626,
notes: "They have in Turkey and the East certaine Confections, which they call Servets [sherbets], which are like to Candied
Conserves and...these they dissolve in Water, and therof make their Drinke...'...Stiff fruit fruit jellies, coated in sugar, as well
as wobbly ones for the pudding table, were greatly in favour during the eighteenth century, when the thickening agent used was
sometimes isinglass...Another type of conserved fruit sweetmeat persists as the unappetisingly named 'leather', thin layers of
fruit paste, made of fruit and sugar in equal parts...This leather is known as armadine in the Middle East..."<br>

"Jelly beans are a combination of the Middle Eastern fruit-gum candy Turkish Delight and the
seventeenth-century method of coating Jordan almonds. The production of jelly beans has
changed little since the candy was first developed in the late nineteenth century...The date of the
introduction of the jelly bean is in dispute, but the earliest known published mention of the candy
was October 2, 1898, in the <i>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</i>. By the turn of the century, jelly beans were
popular, selling for nine to twelve cents per pound, and by the 1930s they had become associated

"As with many other sweets, mass-production and cheapness banished the magic. They have become slicker, from techniques for glazing
the surface with edible waxes. They have become more yielding, as 'soft panning' evolved, using glucose syrup in place of sugar
syrup required for old-fashioned hard comfits, and relying as much on air currents as on heating to dry the sweets. Jelly beans are
the best example: developed in the USA, these spread eastwards to Europe, together with chewing gum (the varieties of this which have
crisp little sugar shells are also panned)."<br>

Modern lemon drops, like most hard candies we know today, descend from ancient medicinal losenges. Mary Poppins' famous line "A spoonful of sugar makes the
 medicine go down" was not overstated. 
18th century advances in sugar technology made possible hard sugar concoctions. The tang of Mediterranean <a href="foodpies.html#lemons">
lemons</a>, embraced from ancient times forward, made
 perfect sense in this particular context. 
<p>
<a name="drops">
<b>What are drops?</b><br>
"Drops. Small round confections originally made by 'dropping' a mixture in rounds to set. In common with words such as kisses and Laddu (Hindi) the word describes a shape rather than
 a recipe. Acid, fruit, and gum drops are all still produced. Chocolate is also made into drops, as are cake and biscuit mixtures, e.g. sponge drops. Acid drops (a contraction of acidiulated 
drops) are small clear sweets made from sugar boiled to the hard crack stage...with the addition of tartaric acid to give a sour flavor. Fruit drops are similar confections, highly coloured, 
flavoured with natural or synthetic essences. Pear drops are a popular British sweet, coloured half-red, half-yellow, roughly pear shaped and flavoured with jargonelle pear essence, or 
synthetic pentyl acetate. All these are descended from earlier fruit confections. Recipes which would have produced something close to a modern conception of fruit drips were given by
 La Varenne in Le Parfait Confiturier (1667). Acid juices such as lemon or pmegranate were added to boiled sugar. The acid had the desirable effect of keeping the sugar mixture clear and 
hard when it cooled, instead of 'graining', i.e. recrystallizing to granulated sugar. Other drop recipes called for powdered sugar mixed with fruit juices, giving a result similar to icing. In the
 late 18th and early 19th centuries, extra acid in the form of vinegar or tartaric acid (or in one recipe oil of vitriol, sulphuric acid), were added to boiled sugar, and modern drops evolved. 
Other flavourings included coffee, and perfumes such as rose, violet, and bergamot. The latter survives as a French regional specialty, bergamottes de Nancy. Peppermint is still used as 
a flavouring in Britain. Overtly medicinal ingredients, such as horehound, wintergreen, and liquorice, turned the confections in to cough drops. Paregoric, added to some cough drops, 
originally referred to a camphorated opium compound, now reduced to a harmless flavouring. Boiled sugar drops are usually made into attractive and varied shapes by putting the 
mixture, whilst still warm, through 'drop rollers' which both shape and cut the mixture. 'Gum' drips and 'jelly' drops rely on gelling agents for their textures and are shaped by starch 
moulding."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson, [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2nd ed., 2006  (p. 257) 
<p>
The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> (2nd edition) defines drops, as they relate to confectionery as "A losenge or sugar-plum, originally of spherical form, but now of various shapes. 
Freq. with defining word prefixed, as acid drop, cough-drop, peppermint-drop." The first print evidence in English dates to 1723: "J. Nott Cooks & Confectioner's Dict., section 91 To
 make Bisket Drops."

<b>Sample 19th century recipe</b><br>
<blockquote>
<b>[1827] <br>
"No. 71.--Of Drops. </b>The drop is composed of aromatic refined sugar only; it requires much care and cleanliness in the making. Take double refined sugar, and
 pound and sift it through a hair sieve, not too fine to obtain a large grain; then sift it through a silk sieve, to take out all the fine dust, which would destroy the beauty 
of the drop, as this takes away its transparency, and prevents its shining. The sugar being thus prepared, put it into a very clean pan, and moisten it with any 
aromatic you choose, as rose-water, &c.; pour in the rose-water slowly, stirring it with a spaddle; you will know whether the sugar be moist enough, if, on taking
 up some on the spaddle, it falls off without sticking to it. You may colour the sugar if you please with a small quantity of liquid carmine, or any other colour ground 
very fine, and made very smooth by moistening it with water only: the lightest colours are best. Take a pan with a lip...and fill it about with paste, and place the pan 
on a small stove, the half hole being the size of the pan; stir the sugar with a little ivory or bone spaddle, till it becomes liquid; when you see it about to boil, take it 
from the fire, and continue to stir it; if it be too moist, take a little of the powdered sugar, (which you should reserve for the purpose when you begin), and add a 
spoonful to your paste, and keep stirring it till it be of such a consistence as to run without extending itself too smooth; take the little pan in your left hand, and hold it
 in your right a bit of iron, copper, or silver wire, four inches long, to take off the drop from the lip of the pan,and let it fall regularly on the tin-plate; two hours 
afterwards you may take off the drops with the blade of a knife."

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Lollipops</b></font><br>
Food historians tell us the art of boiling sugar into hard candy is an ancient practice.
Such concoctions have always been flavored, colored, and shaped according to
popular taste. They have also been used for medicinal purposes (like the cough drops
we know today). The word lollipop makes its way into English print in the last quarter of
the 18th century, though the meaning is somewhat different from the product we know
today. It is interested to note that the insertion of sticks into hard candy traces only to
the beginning of the 20th century. One possible explanation? Modern machinery. 
<p>
Why are lollipops generally considered
a child's candy? Some theorize the stick made lollipops 
safer for children to consume (think: hard candy choking hazard). After WWII, savvy <a href="foodcandy.html#banklollipops">banks</a>
stocked lollipops to encourage family visits.
<p>
"Sugar candy...both the etymology of the term sugar candy and the methods given in early
recipes for making it indicate an ancient origin. Sugar candy can be traced back through Persian
  quand to Sanskrit  khanda, maning sugar in pieces. The fact that the word has such an ancient
derivation shows just what a desirable and uncommon item sugar candy was as it travelled from
culture to culture."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999
(p. 768) 
<p>
"When sugar first became known in Europe it was a rare and costly commodity, valued mainly for
its supposed medicinal qualities and finding its place in the pharmacopoeia of the medieval
apothecary...Sugar gradually became more widely available in Europe during the Middle Ages. In
Britain it was considered to be an excellent remedy for winter colds. It might be eaten in the form
of candy crystals...or it might be made into little twisted sticks which were called in Latin penida,
later Anglicized to pennets. The tradition of penida survives most clearly in American stick candy
which is similarly twisted and flavoured with essences supposed to be effective against colds, such
as oil of wintergreen."<br>

"Lollipop. The word lollipop is first recorded in 1784, in a January issue of the
<i>London Chronicle</i>...At this stage...lollipops were simply  sweets (a meaning the
abbreviated lolly retains in Australia and New Zealand), and it does not seem to have
been until the early twentieth century that they gained their now quintessential
characteristic, the stick...As for the origin of lollipop itself, that is not altogether clear;
the explanation usually given is that it was based on  lolly an obsolete northern
[English] term for  the tongue (so called because it   lolls' out.)"<br>

confectioners are still called lollies though they are stickless....In the USA the other
end of the word (pop) has been used as the bais for the...term  popsicle."<br>

"Lollipop. A hard candy attached to a stick usually made of rolled paper (1785). It is a
favorite children's snack and has been so since it was introduced in England in the

probably associated with the sound made when the candy is withdrawn from the
mouth."<br>

<p>
Instructions for making these sweets are included in professional confectioners' texts.
There were special machines for achieving perfect shapes and inserting the sticks.
<i>Skuse's Complete Confectioner</i> [London:1890s] has several recipes for boiled
sugar [hard] candies. Most of these were shaped as sticks, drops, rocks, and balls.
They came in a variety of flavors and colors. There is no mention of inserting sticks into
any of these creations. There is also a small section devoted to "boiled sugar toys."
These candies were shaped with molds. According to Skuse, animal shapes were very
popular. There is also instruction for making three-dimensional [hollow] candy whistles.
<p>
The earliest "recipe" for lollipops [with a stick] we have is from 1918/1919:
<blockquote>
<b>"All day suckers or loulopops.</b><br>
This is an old-time piece which has lately come into favor once more. It is more or less
a wholesale piece, but is simple to make if the small shop has a sucker machine. It is
made as follows: 10 pounds sugar, 10 pounds corn syrup, 1 quart water. Cook to 290

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Marmalade</b></font><br>
The history of marmalade, <a href="foodcandy.html#jellyjam">jams, jellies, conserves and preserves</a> is fascinating, connected, and complicated. Marmalade, as we know it today, is generally made with oranges. Food historians confirm this was not always the case. You will find our notes (with selected historic recipes) here:
<p>
"Marmalade, in Britain, refers to a jam-like preserve made from the bitter, or Seville, orange. The inclusion of the orange peel, cut into thin 'chips' or shreds, is 
characteristic of this preserve. 'Marmalades' based on other citrus fruits, such as lime or lemon, are made as is ginger marmalade. However, orange marmalade is 
perceived as the archtype (although not the prototype), and orange marmalade, with toast, is part of the 20th-century concept of the traditional English breakfast.
 The evolution of marmalade is a complicated story...Marmelada was the Portuguese name for a sweet, solid, quince paste...This luxury good was imported to 
Britain by the laste 15th cnetuy, to be used as a medicine or a sweetmeat. Clear versions were known as cotignac (France) or quiddony (England). Recipes for 
quiddonies and thick quince marmalades of this sort are frequent in 16th- and 17th-century English cookery books. Lemons and bitter oranges had also been 
imported to medieval and Tudor England. These...were pulped into stiff  'conserves' and were called, by analogy with the Portuguese product, 'marmalades'. They 
were set in wooden boxes, or moulded in fancy shapes, to form part of the dessert or banquet course. Other fruits, such as camsons, apples, pears, and peaches
 were also made into marmalades. All these marmalades were relatively solid confections, to be cut into slices and eaten from the fingers, not at all like moderrn
 marmalade. The 18th century saw a new developement; finely cut peel, the precursor of the modern product. There is a strong traditional belief that Sctoland was
 responsible for the creation of the new jellied orange marmalade. If some of the tales told in support of this belief tax credibility, never mind, it 'feels' right. At this 
time marmalade was still percieved as a suitable item for dessert in England; but Scottish recipes for the mid-18th century used a higher proportion of water, giving 
a 'spreadable'  consistency.  In fact marmalade does appear to have been used as a breakfast spread at a much earlier date in Scotalnd than in England. Meanwhile
, and well into the 19th century, thick quice marmalades continued to appear in recipe books, so at this time the term 'marmamalde' was used in a wider range of 
senses than it is now...It was during the latter part of the 19th century that jams...became the subject of a rapidly growing industry, mainly because sugar became 
much cheaper. Bread and jam became a cheap source of noursihment for the working classes. And marmalade received a boost, since the jam factories could 
produce orange marmalade in winter at not much greater cost than that of jams made with home-grown fruits during the summer. Marmalade...had more of a luxury
 image than jam, and was exported to be used on breadfast tables throughout the British Empire...The range of differnt marmalades now being made in Britain, 
including some based on combinations of several citrus fruits, dark and light ones, chunky ones, and some with just slivers of peel in a clear jelly...is vast..."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidsion [Oxford Univeristy Press:Oxford] 2nd edition, 2006 (p. 483)
<p>
"The word marmalade originally signified 'quince jam.' It comes via French from Portuguese marmelada, a derivative of marmelo, 'quince'. This in turn goes
 ultimately to melimelon, a Greek term, meaning literally 'honey-apple', which was applied to the fruit of an apple gree grafted on to a quince...In the fifteenth and 
early sixteenth centuries such quince preserve was known in English as chare de quince or chardecoynes...but in 1524 we find the first referernce to marmalade, in 
an account of the presentation of 'one box of marmalade' to the king by a certain 'Hull of Exeter'. Throughout the sixteenth century its main ingredient appears to
 have remained quince, but the seventeenth century saw a sudden diversity, with fruits such as plums, damsons, and even straweberries and dates being used for
 marmalade (at this time citrus fruits preserved in sugar was still generally called succade...In 1767, Hannah Glasse gave a recipe for 'marmalade of cherries', and as
 late as 1845 Eliza Acton in her <i>Modern Cookery for Private Families</i> was giving directions on how to make a 'marmamade'. As this last phase implies, marmalade
 was from earliest times not the soft spreadable confection of today, but a firm sweetmeat that could be cut with a knife, and was eated as part of the dessert course
 of a meal. The use of citrus fruits for marmalade seems to have begun in the seventeenth cnetury, and in the middle of that century we find the first references to the
 addition of sliced peel. But it is not really until the middle of the nineteeth century that this ingredient had so ousted all others that it became safe to assume that 
marmalade meant, essentially, 'orange marmalade'...In other European languages, such as French and German, the word still means generally 'jam' or 'preserve'...
but the notion of  'citrus preserve' has become so firmly ensconced in English that in 1981 and EC edict declared that the term marmalade could not be applied to 
a product made other than with oranges, lemons, or grapefruit."<br>

and if the chips look too numerous, part of them may be withheld for pudding-seasoning. The orange-grate, if a strong flavour is wanted, may either be added in 
substance, or infused, and the tincture strained and added to the marmamalde when boiling. Where marmalade is made in large quantities for exportation, the
 various articles are prepared and put at once into a thin syrup, and boiled for from four to six hours, and potted in large jars. Orange-marmalade bay be thinned,

The history of the marshmallow quite interesting. Did you know this confection (albeit in a very
different form) dates back to Ancient times? The very first "marsh mallows" were <a href="foodcandy.html#mallow">plants</a> [Althaea
officinalis] indigenous to Europe and Asia. The flowers were favored by the Ancient Greeks and
Romans because they were considered to be healthful. Platina in his <i>De Honesta
Voluptuate et Valetudine</i> [<i>On Right Pleasure and Good Health</i>] (an Italian cookery text
published in the late 15th Century)
devotes Book IV, Section 8 to "On the Seasoning of Mallow," in which he outlines the botanical
history and healing properties of this particular plant. Marshmallows, progenitor of the fluffy
white confection we eat today [which, by the way contains NO marsh mallow], originated in
France sometime during the middle of the nineteenth century. <a href="foodcandy.html#marshmallowroasts">Marshmallow roasts</a>
commenced in the late 19th century.
<p>
"Marshmallows or Guimauves are a form of sweetmeat for which the confectioner is indebted to
the pharmacist. The original Pate de Guimauve was a pectoral remedy. It was made, as the name
implies, from a decoction of marshmallow root, with gum to bind the ingredients together, beaten
egg white to give lightness and to act as a drying agent, while sugar was incorporated to make the
whole palatable. Marshmallow has come down to us basically unchanged except that it no longer
contains extract of marshmallow. The marjority of marshmallows are made with egg albumen and
gelatin, some are made with all of one and none of the other..."<br>
---<i>Skuse's Complete Confectioner</i>, 13th edition [W.J. Bush & Company:London] 1957
(p. 145)
<p>
"Marshmallows are one of the earliest confections know to humankind. Today's marshmallows
come in many forms, from solid...to semi-liquid---to the creme-like or as an ice cream topping.
Originally...marshmallows were made from the rood sap of the marsh mallow (Althaea officinalis)
plant. It is a genus of herb that is native to parts of Europe, north Africa, and Asia. Marsh
mallows grow in marshes and other damp areas...The first marshmallows were made by boiling
pieces of the marsh mallow root pulp with sugar until it thickened. After is had thickened, the
mixture was strained and cooled. As far back as 2000BC, Egyptians combined the marsh
mallow root with honey. The candy was reserved for gods and royalty.
<p>
Modern marshmallow confections were first made in France around 1850. This first method of
manufacture was expensive and slow because it involved the casting and molding of each
marshmallow. French candy makers used the mallow root sap as a binding agent for the egg
whites, corn syrup, and water. The fluffy mixture was heated and poured into the corn starch in
small molds, forming the marshmallows. At this time, marshmallows were still not mass
manufactured. Instead, they were made by confectioners in small stores or candy companies.
<p>
By 1900, marshmallows were available for mass consumption, and they were sold in tins as penny
candy.  Mass production of marshmallows became possible with the invention of the starch mogul
system of manufacture in the late 19th century...
<p>
In 1955, there were nearly 35 manufacturers of marshmallows in the United States. About this
time, Alex Doumak, of Doumak, Inc., patented a new manufacturing method called the extrusion
process. This invention changed the history of marshmallow production and is still used today. It
now only takes 60 minutes to produce a marshmallow. Today, there are only three manufacturers
of marshmallows in the United States, Favorite Brands International (Kraft marshmallows),
Doumak, Inc. and Kidded & Company."
<p>
A sidebar to the information contained in this books (written by Donna R. Bearden) adds:
"In the early 20th century, marshmallows were considered a child's confection, dispensed as penny
candy at general stores along with licorice whips and peppermint drops. But through a fortuitous
connection with other popular foods and some clever marketing, marshmallows would soon
become a staple ingredient at pot-luck dinners, family get-togethers, and even elegant parties....A
perusal through twentieth-century cookbooks and recipe booklets reveals that marshmallows
usually served as an ingredient in cakes, candies, and desserts....Perhaps the greatest distinction
for marshmallows occurred as a result of their advantageous connection with gelatin salads and
desserts, which rose in popularity during the 1920s and 1930s. Recipe booklets for Jell-O and
Knox Gelatin from that time include recipes that called for marshmallows on almost every
page--recipes like banana fluff, lime mallow sponge, cocoa tutti frutti, and paradise pudding."<br>

"Mallow, a common wild plant of Europe, Mallow was a potherb in Greece and Rome, more

An aside by Lucian suggests that it was used, like lettuce nowadays, as a garnish on trays of food
at banquets. It also had medicinal uses...Marshmallow (Althaea officinalis), Greek althaia, Latin

<b>Marshmallow cream/creme</b><br>
The general concensus of the food history sources is that <a
href="http://www.marshmallowfluff.com/pages/history1.html">Marshmallow Fluff</a> was the first
marsmallow creme to
be manufactured and marketed on a large scale to the American public. 
"Is Fluff the same as Marshmallow Creme?
Generically, they are the same, but Fluff is made by a costly, batch-whipping process. Creme is
whipped in a continuous mixing process. The differing results are quite evident." (
<a href="http://www.marshmallowfluff.com/htm/recipe_frame.shtml">Durkee &
Mower</a>).<p>  Prior to that
marshmallow creme-type products were made by cooks at home. Many late 19th century
marshmallow paste recipes produced solid foods. The first spreadable marshmallow creme recipes
we find in American used store-bought marshmallows. This substance was used for cake filling. 
<p>
The earliest mention we find of marshmallow creme in an American cookbook is from Fannie
Farmer's <i>Boston School Cook Book</i>, 1896:<blockquote>
<b>"Marshmallow cake.</b><br>
1/2 cup butter<br>
1 1/2 cups sugar<br>
1/2 cup milk<br>
2 cups flour<br>
3 teasoons baking powder<br>
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar<br>
Whites 5 eggs<br>
1 teaspoon vanilla. <br>
Follow recipe for mixing butter cakes. Bake in shallow pans, and put Marshmallow Cream
between the layers and on the top." (p. 427)
</blockquote>
Ms. Farmer does not give a recipe for Marshmallow Cream in this book (perhaps an oversight?).
She does give a recipe for Marshmallow Paste in the cake filling section:
<blockquote>

<b>"Marshmallow paste</b><br>
3/4 cup sugar<br>
1/4 cup milk<br>
1/4 marshmallows<br> 
2 tablespoons hot water<br>
1/2 teaspoon vanilla<br>

minutes. Break marshmallows in pieces and melt in double boiler, add hot water and cook until
mixture is smooth, then add hot syrup gradually, stirring constantly. Beat until cool enough to
spread, then add vanilla. This may be used for both filling and frosting." (p. 435)

Sarah Tyson Rorer lists this recipe in 1902:<blockquote>
<b>"Marshmallow filling. </b>

<b>Marshmallow roasts</b><br>
Old newspapers suggest marshmallow roasts (consumers heating purchased marshmallows over open fire for fun) began in the late 19th century.
<p>
"'Marshmallow roasts' are the newest thing in summer resort diversions. The simplicity of this form of amusement is particularly charming.
 One buys two or three pounds of marshmallows, invites half a dozen friends, and that is all the preparation required. However a small
amount of kindling-wood must be taken along with which to build a small fire in an unfrequented spot on the beach, away from crowds unfamiliar with so
 refined a species of entertainment. When the fire is blazing merrily, or better still, when it has died down to red embers, each member
of the party takes a sharpened stick and affixes upon the end of it a marshmallow. Simutaneously all those engaged hold their
marshmallows over the embers, as close as possible to avoid burning and roast dexterously, so as to brown the marshmallows nicely on all
sides. This requires some skill, because marshmallows are highly inflammable and will take fire if not very prudently handled. The...marshmallows...swell up
to considerable more their nomal size...They are a sort sublimated combination of candy and cake, all ine one bite, though the proper fashion
is to nibble the roasted marshmallow off the end of the stick. One set consumed, each person pokes the point of his wooden skewer 
through another marshmallow and the performance is repeated until everybody's appetite is satisfied Marshmallow roasts are an excellent medium
for flirtation...appropriatly exhibited by nibbling the marshmallows of each other's sticks. Accordingly the idea is sure to grow in favor."<br>

<a name="marzipan">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Marzipan</b></font><br>
Food historians tell us marzipan, a paste composed of ground <a href="foodcandy.html#almonds"> almonds</a>
and <a href="foodcandy.html#aboutsugar">sugar</a>, probably originated in the Middle East and introduced to
Europe in the late Middle Ages. There is much scholarly debate regarding the etymology of this
word. Hense, the true origins are obscure. Marzipan is well documented from the Renaissance to
present. One of the special features of this particular confection is its ability to be
sculpted into fanciful shapes.
<p>
According to the British food historians, marzipan can be placed in England at the end of the 15th
century. This conclusion is drawn from documented print evidence. Certainly, words (as foods)
enter a culture before they are recorded in print. If you are interested in a detailed discussion on
the complicated history of the word "marzipan" ask your librarian to help you find "Venice and
the Spice Trade," <i>Medieval Arab Cookery</i>, Maxime Rodinson, A.J. Arberry & Charles
Perry [Prospect Books:Devon] 2001 (p. 211-3)
<p>
"Marzipan, a paste made from ground almonds, was orignally called marchpane in English--or
martspane, or mazapane, or marchpan. These were the best efforts English-speakers could make
at the word when it was borrowed, either via early modern French "marcepain" or from its
source, Italian "marzapane," at the end of the fifteenth century."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 206)
<p>
"Marchpane, or marzipan was a discovery of the later Middle Ages, dependent as it was upon the
union of ground almonds with sugar...One of the earliest uses for the paste was in
<b>subtleties</b>.
These were figures of men, animals, trees, castles and so forth made from sugar paste and jelly,
and placed before an admiring audience at the end of each course of a great medieval feast. Often
the figures had an allegorical meaning, and bore written mottoes appropriate to the occasion. The
 subtleties varied from simple depictions of a gilded eagle, or a swan upon a green stork, carrying
mottoes in their bills, to such complexities as a portrayal of the Trinity in the sun of gold with a
crucifix in His hand attended by saints and the kneeling figure of the new Archbishop of
Canterbury, for whose enthronement feast the  subtlety had been made. When they had been
sufficiently applauded they were dismantled and eaten.
     In the fifteenth century a  marchpane  began to emerge as an object in its own right. And by
Elizabeth I's reign, when the  subtlety was becoming archiaic, a marchpane was regularly
produced as the chief showpiece at the banquet or dessert course served to guests at the end of a
meal. 
     It was made of ground almonds and sugar on a base of wafer biscuits, and was formed into a
round (a hoop of green hazelwood somethimes helped shape it).  Ye may while it is moist, strike
it full of comfits of sundry colours, in a comely order...The frosting of the marchpane with sugar
and rosewater to make it shine like ice was an important part of the preparation; and so was the
gilding with decorative shapes in gold leaf..."<br>

<B>About almonds</B><br>
"Almond, kernel of the fruit of the <i>Prunus dulcis</i>. The fruit resembles a meagre peach, but
is inedible. The kernel is used, sliced or ground, in cooking. Some trees produce bitter almonds;
these have to be roasted before eating to eliminate their poisonous prussic acid. Almonds were
being collected from the wild by the inhabitants of Franchthi Cave by 10,000 BC, and in Turkey,
Syria and Palestine by that time or soon afterwards. Cultivation was probably under way by the
third millenium BC: earliest evidence comes from Jordan. The almond was among the earliest of
the domesticated fruit trees of the eastern Mediterranean, since, unlike some of the others, it can
be propagated from seed...At Greek banquets they they were frequent constitutent of dessert...in
Roman cuisine they sometimes served as a flavouring...Bitter almonds were placed in sacci,
bouquets, and to impart their flavour and medicinal properties to wine as it was served. These
properties were widely reputed to include the prefention of drunkenness...Sweet almonds produce
a mild-flavoued oil...Both kinds of almonds, and their oils, were important medicinally."<br>
---<i>Food in the Ancient World From A-Z</i>, Andrew Dalby [Routledge:London] 2003 (p. 6)
<p>
"Almonds are the fruit seeds of Prunus dulcis...a tree closely related to the peach and the plum,
and are said to be native to the Mediterranean region and western Asia, wehre (like many other
nuts) they doubtless helped to sustain our hunting-and-gathering forebears. Perhaps the oldest, as
well as the most widely known, of the world's nut crops, almonds were first cultivated in Europe
by the Greeks, are mentioned frequently in the Old Testament, and were a favorite of the Romans,
whose sugared almonds may have been among the first sweetmeats in history. Recipes
incorporating almond "flour" date from the Middle Ages in Europe, a period when almond "milk"
was also used--as a liquid substitute for milk and eggs on days of fasting. The Spaniards brought
the almond to the New World, where it is now grown extensively in California...There are two
types of almonds: sweet and bitter. Nuts of the latter type contain prussic acid and thus are toxic
when raw; these must be blanched and roasted before being processed into an oil, a paste, or an
extract that is sued to flavor liqueurs and some confections. Sweet almonds...are eaten whole, as
well as blanched, slivered, chopped, diced, and ground for pastries...Almond paste is the soul of
macaroons and marzipan."<br>

"The oldest mention of almond cultivation is in the <i>Bible</i>. Aaron's rod, which miraculously
bore flowers and fruit, was of almond wood (Numbers 17:8). The ancient Greeks cultivated
almonds, and their name for the nut, amygdalon, had become, via Latin, the botanical name of the
species and, in corrupted form, is the name in modern European languages...In classical times
Phoenician traders introduced its cultivation into Spain; and it was being grown in the south of
France...as early as the 8th century...Uses of almonds are in many instances of great antiquity.
They were of early importance in early Arabic and medieval European cookery, partly as a source
of the  almond milk which was used in early versions of blancmange...since then, the main
importance of the nut has been to the confectionery industry. Such products as marzipan and
nougat and macaroon all depend on it. The Spanish range of almond-flavored cakes, biscuits, etc.
is probably the most extensive in the world."<br>

<b>Chinese almonds</b><br> 

"Nuts play a minor part in Chinese food...Most important are the kernels of apricots...Special varieties with uninteresting fruit are grown soley for their large, sweet, 
nontoxic seeds, which are used as almonds are used in the West. True almonds are barely known and not normally used."<br>
---<i>Food of China</i>, E.N. Anderson Yale University Press:New Haven] 1988 (p. 168) 
<p>
"Chinese Almond. Domestication of the almond, Prunus amygdalus, is usually placed in an area stretching from the eastern Mediterranean to Central Asia, where it
 is found in the wild. Likely it was domesticated by the third millennium B.C. or earlier...The early Chinese knew of the tree and its kernels in Persia and other lands
 to the west. They also imported almond kernels, as among the tribute sent from Turkestan to China in T'ang times. The tree itself was reported by the Arab 
merchant Soleiman to be cultivated in China in the mid-ninth century...and Li Shi-chen late in the sixteenth-century wrote of it as growing everywhere 'east of the 
Pass' (that is, in Kansu and Shensi)...Though the above would seem to leave little doubt that almonds had been cultivated at least somewhere in China or its
 margins, there has nevertheless been controversy among Western scholars as to whether, at least in traditional times, almonds were actually grown there and 
whether the kernels that foreigners in China often called 'almonds' were almonds or apricot kernels. Adding to the confusion were the similarities in appearance,
 taste, and use between apricot and almond kernels, which sometimes led the Chinese, on their part, to call the almond kernel by the name 'apricot kernel.'...
Laufer...who has provided the most detailed analysis of the historical evidence, was convinced that the almond had been cultivated in China in the past. He also 
presented evidence from the Chinese literature suggesting that it was still cultivated there in the nineteenth century, but allowed the possibility that almond cultivation
 'is now extinct in China.' Other authorities, among them naturalists and botanists with extensive field experience in traditional China, are more firm in their conclusion
 that almonds were not cultivated there. To this writer, it seems reasonable to believe that the almond could not have been widely cultivated in China and been
 missed by so many widely-traveled, careful observers. Yet the evidence presented by Laufer seems to leave the possibility open that the almond continued to be
 cultivated in some places, especially in the far northwest."<br>

<b>Almonds in Chinese cuisine</b><br> 

"It would, however, have been of quite minor importance overall, with the overwhelming share of the kernels known to foreigners as 'almonds' being in fact apricot
 kernels. This fits with H.L. Li's statement on the matter...that real almonds are scarcely known; and with Meyer's conclusion...that the 'almond cake' commonly 
served foreigners in traditional China was in fact made with kernels of the apricot...There are...several varieties of P. armenaica grown primarily for their seed in 
China. The fruit of the best variety contains a large stone with a fairly-soft shell and sweet kernel, and may be served as a snack, sometimes sugared, along with 
raisins and other kinds of nuts, or ground into almond flour which is made into almond cakes or cookies or into a thin porridge. On occasion, such kernels may be 
salted, and in appearance and flavor are just like real almond. Another variety, P. armeniaca has a bitter-tasting kernel that contains prussic acid and must be used
 in small amounts, as for flavoring sweets, or in making 'almond soup' or 'almond tea,' a drink commonly sold along the streets...As for the preparation of such
 almond soup, Meyer noted that first rice was boiled until soft, then pounded and mixed with water until it had the consistency of milk. Then a few bitter almonds 
were ground up and blended in along with sugar, and the soup served hot. The soup, which was tasty and stimulating, was commonly consumed by the Chinese
 just before going to bed. Such 'almond soup' or 'almond tea' was well-liked as a snack not only among the people of North China but in the Ch'ing court, was also 
believed effective against sore throat...There was also a popular dish, found among those of Ch'ing court, called 'Almond Curd,' a cold gelatin dessert made of 
water, agar-agar, ground almonds, and sugar...Such almond soup and almond curd (also called almond float, almond lake, or almond junket), as made today in 
China, may include almond or vanilla extract, milk, and/or fruit of one sort or another...Prepared in a different, somewhat more elaborate way is the Cantonese 
dessert 'Fried Almond Custard'...Chinese almonds are also commonly used in other ays, as in candies, cakes, and cookies, and in a broad range of main dishes,  such as Cantonese 'Red and White Chicken with Almonds' and the Szechwanese 'Almond Duck'."<br>

<b>Almond symbolism</b><p>
"The almond tree originated in the Middle East and western Asia, and since prehistory people
considrered it a symbol of sweetness and fragility. In the spring, the tree was one of the first to
bloom, and late frosts could easily destroy its delicate buds. If the almond tree survived the frosts,
it soon became a bestower of a wealth of gifts. In addition to providing nuts, oil, and shells for
fuel, the almond tree was aesthetically pleasing, with lovely flowers and beautiful leaves. So the
almond tree inspired worship....The identification of the almond as father or as mother reflected the fact that almond blossoms herald the spring and thus the birth of vegetation. Because the
almond tree blossoms suddenly, the Hebrews considered it a symbol of haste, and because the
almond tree that survives the frosts bestows gifts of nuts and oil, they considrered it a symbol of
vigilance...People revered the almond tree as a provider--of life, of love, and of happiness."<br>

"There are essentially two types of almond: bitter almonds, which contain prussic acid by can be used in very sparing quantities as
a flavoring, and ordinary eating almonds. Of the latter, Jordan almonds are probably the most highly regarded variety. Their long thin
shape may have inspired the comparison of oriental women's eyes to almonds. They have no connection whatsoever with Jordan (they are 
mainly grown in Spain, in fact); their name is an alteration of Middle English <i>jaren</i> ('garden') <i>almond</i>."<br>

for growing them. This species of almond is regarded by the agricultural authorities as the finest in the world, but only its

"For many years it has been the ambition of California almond growers to produce Jordan almonds in that State. They did not get
on very well with their first attempts, but recently a nursery company doing business at Alameda imported some almond trees
from France, where Jordan almonds are rarely found, and from one of these trees some very good specimens of what were supposed
to be real Jordan almonds were produced. In order to find out whether they were real Jordans, the nursery company sent samples
to the United States Consul in Malaga...the were unhesitatingly declared to be almondra larga, of the famous Jordan almonds
of commmerce, of fair medium grade. The taste seemed quite the same, and there is a very little difference in the shape. A 
surprising feature of this incident lies in the fact that the almonds in question are said to have been grown on a tree imported 
from France...The report from California and the result of my investigation would indicate...that Jordan almonds can now be grown in California.
 If this be true, California growers probably will find the matter will be worth their attention, as both the demand and the prices
for Jordan almonds have steadily increased during recent years. The present price of these almonds for the popular grade 
known as confectioners' is $3.75 per box of twenty-five pounds at Malaga."<br>

 wedding feasts. Today's wedding favors typically featurehttp://foodtimeline.org/foodcakes.html#dragee <a href="foodcandy.html#jordanalmonds">Jordan almonds</a>.

banquet table little baskets of dry sweetmeats decorated with ribbons: one for each guest, to be taken home and shared with the
family. it is echoed by the gift of 'favours', little bags of sugared almonds, to wedding guests in southern Europe. Not just wedding
guests: different colours of almond indicate different celebrations, a christening, an engagement, and anniversary (although some--

Ancient Greeks and Romans valued <a href="http://www.botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/m/mints-39.html">
mint</a> for several medical reasons. Two of these were aiding digestion and freshening one's breath.
Throughout time, mint was used to flavor many differenty types of foods. Mint candies, as we know them
today, date back to Renaissance times (when sugar was readily available). Mint-flavored chocolate candies
date back to the second half of the 19th century (when solid chocolate was manufactured as candy.)The practice of pairing 
<a href="foodcandy.html#lambmint">lamb with mint</a> capitalizes on mint's soothing digestive properties.
<p>

"Mint. The common name of most plants of the genus Mentha. There are two dozen species, and many
hundreds of varieties...The superstitions and beliefs associated with mint are often of ancient origin and vary
with different cultures...In Rome, Pliny recommended that a wreath of mint was a good thing for students to
wear since it was thought to 'exhilarate their minds'...Mints, usually spearmint, are used, fresh or dried, to
make jams, jellies, and sauces, to accompany meat, fish, or vegetable dishes...In England mint sauce is
served with roast lamb. Gerard (1633) wrote that 'the smell of mint does stir up the minde and the taste to a
greedy desire of meat'. Certainly the mint flavor is sweet and refreshing; and mint has digestive properties,
so the habit of taking an 'after-dinner mint' has some foundation."<br>

"Sugar was considered to have health benefits; it was also useful for preserving decoctions of herbs and
other physic such as flowers and roots. It made bitter herbs more palatable and, formed into candy, allowed
the slow release of soothing essences for sore throats and coughs. Recipes of this kind were probably the
ancestors of several sweets which have survived as regional specialties: cough candy, Kendal Mint Cake,
and Scottish tablet...It has a long precedent, and is a survivor of many other candied medicaments, most of
which have vanished. Cures for other ailments were sometimes administered in candy, as a recipe from A
Queens Delight shows:  Sugar of Wormwood, Mint, Anniseed, or any other of that kinde. Take double
refined sugar; and do but wet it in fair water, or Rose-water and boil it to a candy, when it is almost boiled
takeit  off and stir till it be cold; the drop in three or four drops of the Oyles of whatsoever you will make, and
stir it well, then drop it on a board, being before fitted with sugar.'...The qualities of mint as a digestive, and
the alternatives...suggest the recipe was intended to comfort the digestion. The recipe is an early published
example of the use of mint in sweetmeats in Britain. This flavour, not a distinctive feature of Polos, mint
imperials, spearmint gum, Glacier Mints and many others, appears to have become popular in the middle
of the last century. A factor may have been ready availability of good-quality mit oil from Mitcham in Surrey,
at a time when sugar confectionery was rapidly commercializing. Mint oil was reliable, probably relatively
cheap, and a strong flavour which was easy to handle, by small-as well as large-scale confectioners.
Candied peppermint was one of several simple mint-flavored confections given in a small, provincial book
in the1820s. Mint-flavored candy is still being made by a similar process to the seventeeth-century recipe
given above (but without the rosewater) and sold under the name of Kendal Mint Cake. Why this confection
should survive as a specialty of a small town in north-west England is not clear. The first record of an
association between product and town occurs in the mid-nineteeth century."<br>

While it is true that mint is an ancient herb known to the Greeks, culinary evidence confirms the

the problem of powdered pop have led to the already legendary Pop Rocks and Space Dust candies, which are still being test marketed, and black-marketed by 
kids where they aren't available. The candies fizz, releasing carbonation in the mouth or in the hand when they come in contact with moisture. While General Foods

candy brands 'in any makret where they are introduced,' according to a GF exec. But the unusual candies, which cause a bursting, tinlging sensation in the mouth, 
can be marketed only for 13-week periods at a time in order to prevent the carbonation from dissapating and spoioing the moment for kids. They are also sensitive 
to heat, so GF has a policy of not introducing them in markets where the average temperature exceeds 85 degrees. GF is attempting to educate the trade about the
 prdoucts because of instances where they have been 'bootlegged' into other markets. In one case, a heat in a truck carrying the prudcuts was accidentally turned 
on. The gas released from several hundred Pop Rocks cases eventually blew the truck doors open. 'When that happens, you're left with just hard candy,' the exec
 said. The carbon dioxide in Pop Rocks is one-tenth of the amount contained in a can of soft drink...Now that temperatures are beginning to climb across the
 nation, GF has stopped selling them. When fall arrives, however, Pop Rocks and Space Dust willl reappear in much wider distribution, perhaps as many as 37 
states. During a 13-week introduction, a reatailer is permitted a single order and receives one shipment. According to the GF exec, a retailer can expect to sell half 
his supply within four weeks and 90% by the tenth week. The candies have been subject of much free publicity in newspapers and on network tv talk shows,
 including Johnny Carson's monolog on the 'Tonight Show' April 12. Although there has been no advertising to date, Benton & Bowles has done some concept 
work on the products. Pop Rocks was first tested in Flagstaff and Yuma, Ariz, in 1976. It was followed by Space Dust, whose initial test markets were in 
Colorado and Arizona. Both sell for 15 cents. In February of last year, the phrase 'explore the far reaches of your mind.' was removed from packages of Space 
Dust after GF received complaints that the reference seemed based on drug use. At the time, the company expressed shock that anyone would misinterpret the 
phrase. The company earlier denied rumors that the patented technique used to produce Pop Rocks and Space Dust would be applied in development of a 
carbonated powdered drink mix."<br>

"General Foods has a hit with Pop Rocks and Space Dust, two forms of the hard candy with locked-in carbonation that makes an audible appearance when it his 
the mouth. But despite their success, both 15-cent candies have not left test-market status, regardless of how many kids bootleg them across the country. The 
problem is the manufacturer can't introduce them 'in markets where the average temperature exceeds 85 degrees,' <i>Advertising Age</i> reported. Not only are kids 
bootlegging them, but eager merchants are, too. And one hapless fellow lost his whole shipment when the truck carrying it accidentally had its heat turned on. The 
Pop Rock cargo released its carbonation and blew the truck doors open. Next fall, though, General [Foods] plans to market the candies temporarily in 37 safely 
cool states, making the candies perhaps the only processed snack available soley in season."<br>

"'It's like raining on the roof of your mouth,' says a middle-aged person who tried it...'It' is Pop Rocks, a new carbonated hard candy that sizzles, snaps, pops 
and tingles in your mouth, and brings grimaces, faint smiles and startled reactions from first-time tasters. "Explore the far reaches of your mind," says the package. 
Since it has no apparent purpose or social significance--two key fad criteria--Pop Rocks promises to win a place in the pantheon of freaky gimmicks that infect 
America from time to time. All of which brings more smiles than grimaces to General Foods, maker of Pop Rocks, which has sold "hundreds of millions" of the 
packets...In fact, in true fad fashion Pop Rocks seem to be something of a hot underground item. They're being bootlegged to New York and sold on the street and
 in a few stores for three and four times the normal price. Rumors about their existence and even a few samples of the 20-cent packages have reached Washington, 
but exactly when the product will be on sale here, the manufacturer isn't saying. Meanwhile reports like a recent on in <i>Advertising Age</i>  (confirmed by General 
Foods) that a overheated load of Pop Rocks blew the doors open on a delivery truck have raised questions about the product's safety. Speculation that Pop Rocks
 might harm the esophogus or the taste buds led NBC consumer reporter Betty Furness to take to the air recently to calm parents' fears. The secret ingredient of 
General Foods' smash seller is carbon dioxide, about one-tenth the amount that's put into soft drinks to make them fizz. While a Pop Rock left on the tip of the
 tongue with one's mouth open will "explode," ingredients for the product were okayed by the Food and Drug Administration before General Foods started to
 test market it in 1976. Meanwhile, the company's hot product has its own unique sales difficulties. The company says Pop Rocks can't be sold in areas where the 
average temperature is over 85 degreses. And sales are being suspended over the summer for the same reason. The shelf-life is also limited because the 
carbonation dissapates over a period of time and then you're left with "just another hard candy." But wherever they appear, says the company, they are being
 hoarded. It's not unusal to see people walk out of a store, carrying a large shopping bag filled with nothing but Pop Rocks or Star Dust (the former are large 
rock-like pieces; the latter, dust-like bits.) Which explains why the candy is outselling most, if not all major candy bars "in any market where they are introduced."

"The giant semi raced through the night across America from California to Brooklyn. Inside was a precious cargo whos street value in New York would be double
 its West Coast price. Thousands of packs were unloaded at one distributor's warehouse, then channeled stealthily to selected candy and variety shops. Candy 
shops? Yes, the cargo was destined to feed the latest kid candy craze: Pop Rocks. Says the Brooklyn distributor: "The kids sare like junkies--hungry for the stuff. 
It's the fastest-moving new candy I've ever seen." The candy, so goes a Wall Street analyst's version, was born when a General Foods Corp. chemist mixed a little
 "Kool Aid technology" with cargon dioxide...Crystalline in shape and so far available in three flavors (cherry, orange, grape), Pop Rocks are made of sugar, corn 
syrup, milk derivative and artificial coloring and flavoring. When the small crystals of candy are placed in the mouth, tiny chambers of trapped CO2 are activated by
 moisture. The result: a popping and crackling that delights kids. Pop Rocks are hard to get in most places, which only adds to their appear. General Foods markets
 the candy mainly in California, although there have been other test sales around the country in the past three years. GF tries to confine sales of the candy to its test 
markets, where a one-fifth-ounce package sells for 20 cents retail, but entrepreneurs have managed to obtain supplies and spirit them elsewhere, at prices up to 
50c cents a package. Despite the potential demand, GF is moving cautiously before going national. Reason: although the food makes more than 400 food products,
 it has never before sold a candy."<br>

"General Foods has expanded its carbonated confection technology to a bubble gum and is testing Increda Bubble gum in a small market in the Northwest. The 
company hopes the bubble gum will become more of a year-round entry than its carbonated Pop Rocks and Space Dust candies, the latter which is due to be 
reintroduced under the name Cosmic Candy. GF has been marketing the candies on a cyclical basis because of their fad nature...According to sources close to the 
company, GF chose a very small Northwest market to avoid bootlegging--as serious problem that has occurred with the [Pop Rock] candies. In contrast to the
 more usual concern of concealing a test market because of competition, GF's worry is that candy and gum wholesalers/distributors will buy up truckloads of the
 gum to ship East. In the New York area, the candies have sold for more than triple their suggested list price of 15 cents. In a card shop near Advertising Age's 
midtown New York office, Pop Rocks go for 50 cents a packet. Candy and gum distributors advertise in the New York Times to sell their supplies of Pop Rocks 
and Space Dust to retailers. One classified ad reads, "Pop Rock. Hottest candy in the U.S. Fast turnaround--large profit, available wholesale." It's the large profit 
and "consumer ripoff" that GF is hoping to avoid by concealing its test market. GF is worried that in addition to making the test market impossible to read properly,
 hijacking and subsequent high retail prices will hurt GF's image and the product's sales potential when it is offically introduced in the East. Pop Rocks was first
 tested in Flagstaff and Yuma, Ariz. in 1976. It was followed by Space Dust in Colorado and Arizona. It has since been marketed sporadically in a number of 
western markets, but none has been sold since the spring because GF is accumulating enough candy for a major fall introduction in as many as 37 states...The
 packaged foods marketer recognized the fad aspect of the carbonated candies from the start. That is one reason it produces and wharehouses the candies until there 
is a 13 week supply. Usually either pop Rocks or Space Dust--not both--is introduced to a market area. Nine months later, long after the firest candies have 
disappeared from the retail shelves, GF moves into the same market with the other item, and the fad begins anew...Prime targes are children under 15, who buy 
the candies not so much for themselves but to watch their friends try them. After three or four packets, the effect of the carbonation on one person has reached a 
saturation point, noted one source. The candies are expected to be introduced in a broad area this fall. Space Dust has been repackaged and renamed Cosmic 
Candy because of compliant about its association with the drug Angel Dust. Earlier, the phrase "explore the far reaches of your mind," was removed from packages 
of Space Dust after GF received compliants that the reference seemed based on drug use. Network affiliated tv stations also expressed some apprehension about
 tv commercials. The two candies are similar, although Pop Rocks is a somewhat larger  particle."<br>

"What kind of mind thinks up products like exploding candy? "I'm basically a farmer type. I like to work with fruits and vegetables," says 67-year-old William A. Mitchell, a 
silver-haired father of Pop Rocks, a crackling confection so popular that black markets have appeared in schools all over the country. Pop Rocks, a General Foods 
product, is sold in most parts of the country for 20 cents a pack. That's 20 cents a pack in the store. "What's happened is that school kids would buy the packets and  then sell them to their friends with quite a surcharge," Mitchell said in a interview. "They were profiteering." The tremendous demand for Pop Rocks led General Fods to 
build another manufacturing plant and Mitchell is now touring the country to introduce another sizzling sweet called Cosmic candy. Along the way, he's doing his best to 
quash rumors about Pop Rocks. The incendiary effects fo Pop Rocks, a carbonated combination of sugar, flavoring and coloirng, apparently inspired stories of exploding 
stomachs and other maladies among enthusiasts. All false, says Mitchell. "The amount of gas in a pack of Pop Rocks is less than one-tenth of what's in a can of soda 
pop," says Mitchell, noting that Pop Rocks have U.U. Food & Drug Administration approval. "The worst thing they can do is make you burp." Because of the peculiar 
nature of Pop Rocks, the product languished for more than 20 years after Mitchell first created them in 1956. General Foods simply wasn't sure what to do with them. 
"I always thought it should be candy, but most of our people thought it should be in some other product--cereal or something," Mitchell said. Finally, a Canadian division
 started selling Pop Rocks in packets and General Foods decided to market them nationally."<br>

"In 1976, General Foods Corp. began marketing a new candy called Pop Rocks--carbonated crystals that fizz and crackle in the mouth. Pop Rocks became what 
one distributor called "the fastest-moving new candy I've ever seen." Three years later, General Foods is planning to adapt the carbonated-candy idea to other 
products. Pop Rocks have posed some unusual marketing problems, however. Earlier this year, a false but widespread rumor that Mikey, the boy on the Life 
cereal commercial, had died from popping too many rocks prompted General Foods to take out ads in 45 newspapers assuring parents that the ingredients in Pop 
Rocks have FDA approval. Also, the company has to take the unsold candy off the shelves when the daily temperature averages more than 85 degrees. In high 
heat, Pop Rocks can start crackling ouside the mouth--and a shipment once blew open the doors on an overheated delivery truck. The company has so far sold 
more than 500 million packages of Pop Rocks and Cosmic Candy...Bill Mitchell, who invented Pop Rocks, believes that carbonated candy is only the 
beginning--that eventually such crystals will be an ingredient in everything from breakfast cereals to medication. General Foods has already begun test-marketing a 
product known as Increda Bubble--carbonated gum."<br>
---"A Candy Craze Keeps Popping," <i>Newsweek</i>, June 4, 1979 (p. 15)
<p>
"The bubble gum market is continuing to explode with new entries--American Chicle's Crackups, Life Savers' sugarless Bubble Yum and General Foods' especially 
appriate Increda Bubble gum with bursting candy particles...Although GF researchers have experimented with carbonation for years, it wasn't until recent years that
 the company came up with a viable product--carbonated candies. As that business expanded via some incredible successes on the West Coast for Pop Rocks and
 Cosmic Candy, GF began to work on a gum and carbonated candy concoction. Increda Bubble went into test in a small northwestern market a year ago. GF took
 great pains to maintain secrecy in order to avoid the bootlegging that occured with its carbonated candies. The unauthorized shipping of the candies, which crack 
and pop in the mouth, has been cited as a factor in the sales failure in the east. Just as Increda Bubble is rolling out, GF is mulling over the fate of the candies. After 
making what once source descried as a "mint of money" with the candies on the West Coast, GF lost all but a couple of million dollars wtih the disaster in the East. 
The exposure of the candies in eastern markets before they officially debuted eliminating the surprise factor so important in a fad product's success,GF also was 
faced with combating  all sorts of rumors about kids suffering illness or death after tyring the candies. One of the most bizarre and unfounded rumors centered 
around the youth who played "Mikey" in Life cereal commercials. It was rumored he ate the candy with a soda chaser, his tomach exploded and he died. The final 
blow was the unfortuante introduction of the carbonated candies in the Midwest last winter when markets such as Chicago where hit by as series of winter  storms
 that dumped record levels of snow and forced people to remain homebound for days. Despite these setbacks, GF has not given up on carbonated technology. A 
spokesman said Pop Rocks are still sold in some western markets, anthough it won't be there for long. She said no decisions had been made on the candy's 
future...GF has also filed for trademark registration on the name Freeze-In for a freezable carbonated soda concentrate...The company also is looking at novelty 
items, possibly for Halloween, and and ice cream novelty on a stick that would contain the carbonated candy inside. These items are all byproducts of the 
company's search for the so far elusive carbonated drink mix that would expand its franchise in the drink mix field."<br>

"Pop Rocks, the popular carbonated candy that General Foods Corp. quit making after less than three years and many rumors of exploding tummies and choking 
children, is back in stores. The crackling, mouth-tingling treat is being test marketed in New England and the Dakotas by Carbonated Candy Ventures of Buffalo, 
N.Y. False rumors once claimed the candy killed little 'Mikey,' the young character featured in cereal commercials a decade ago, by making his tummy explode, 
and that it made other children gag and choke. While Carbonated Candy said it hasn't seen a resurgence of the rumors, it's not taking any chances. It had a 
laboratory in Connecticut retest the product, which the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) earlier found safe. Wholesalers were instructed to contact the FDA 
about any new rumors."<br>

"Despite bad publicity and several health-food crazes, Pop Rocks soldier on. For 50 years, in fact. To celebrate the anniversary, Pop Rocks Inc. has released a
 limited edition line of Cherry Pop Rocks in their original 1970s packaging. They were developed by General Foods chemist William A. Mitchell in 1956 while
 trying to create an instant soft drink (he holds a patent on <a href="fooddecades.html#tang">Tang</a>). For their first two decades, though, no one quite knew what to with this odd concoction. In 1975,
 they were given suitably garish packaging and christened Pop Rocks. They took off immediately. A hard candy like no other - little fragments containing hidden
 pockets of carbonation - they explode in the mouth, fizzling and darting about. Soon, there was even a Pop Rock mythology. Rumors emerged that Mikey ("Give it
 to Mikey - he'll eat anything!") from the Life cereal commercial died after ingesting an ill-advised combination of pop rocks and soda. The rumors were so 
pervasive that General Foods executives took out ads in major publications and sent out up to 50,000 letters to school administrators extolling Pop Rocks' 
virtues. Inventor Mitchell even hit the road and spoke to audiences about his product. Pop Rocks, he told crowds, were safe, good and right; Mikey was alive and 
well. But rumors die hard. Pop Rocks were briefly discontinued in the mid-1980s." <br>

"Even though Pop Rocks' 30th anniversary officially fizzled out this Jan. 1, Spanish company Zeta Especial will continue to exploit its "explosive" retro candy 
brand with promotions and licensing.  Later this month, Pop Rocks will leverage the sixth season of American Idol with the launch of its I Want to Be a Pop 
Rocks Star promo, in which kids write a song about their love of the popping candy and mail it in with two proofs of purchase. (Entrants don't have to show the
 songwriting skills of Elvis Costello—winners will be chosen through a drawing.) Running through October and dangling special-edition Pop Rocks gear, the 
sweeps will be marketed via print in kids mags such as Disney Adventures, radio promos, sampling, pr and ads on Web sites including Americanidol.com. 
Freestanding store displays sporting an Idol-reminiscent blue oval will communicate the sweeps. The Steven Style Group, New York, is Pop Rocks' full-service 
agency. Popping candy was an afterthought when a General Foods scientist attempted to invent instant soda with carbonized crystals that melt in water. That idea 
never panned out, but his crystals became Pop Rocks, a candy that proved so popular in the '70s that kids were selling 15-cent packs for $1 or more on the candy 
black market. The brand is still reeling from an urban legend in which Life cereal spokeskid Little Mikey's stomach purportedly exploded after he washed down 
Pop Rocks with a Coke. (Mikey, aka John Gilchrist, is doing fine, thank you.). Originally sold in a cherry flavor, Pop Rocks is planning gourmet flavors like 
pumpkin and candy cane, and cotton candy this year. The popping candy has been embedded in fruit rollups, sprinkled on Kellogg's cereals and served as subjects
 for science experiments in a Klutz activity book. Additionally, the brand expects to launch a full licensing program in 2007 with apparel and other lifestyle 
products."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Potato candy</b></font><br>

  We know that potatoes were introduced to North America by European settlers,
  mostly from the northern regions. It stands to reason that potato candy was
  probably first made in Europe and the recipe was brought here by immigrants.
  These could have been from Germany, France, Ireland, Scandinavia, Russia or any
  place where potatoes were popular. Recipes for related products [potato pancakes,
  potato puddings] are found in 19th century cook books. Some of these recipes
  employed sweeteners, such confectioners' sugar. It is possible the recipe for potato
  candy (Irish and other) is derived from these culinary traditions. Many of the
  ingredients are similar. 
  <p>
  Compare these recipes:
  <blockquote>
  <b>"Potato Pudding, Sweet.</b><br>
  Bake half a dozen large potatoes, and when they are done enough break them
  open and scoop out the contents with a spoon. Beat them lightly, and with a quarter
  of a pound of the potato flour put three ounces of clarified butter, half a teaspoonful
  of finely-minced lemon-rind, a dessert-spoonful of lemon juice, a pinch of salt, three
  table-spoonfuls of powdered sugar, and three table-spoonfuls of milk or cream. Beat
  the pudding for five or six minutes, then add separately the yolks and well-whisked
  whites of three eggs. Butter a plain mould, ornament it with dried fruit or slices of
  candied peel, pour in the pudding, and bake in a well-heated oven, or steam the
  pudding if preferred. Turn it out before serving, sift sugar thickly over it, and garnish
  the dish with jam. Time to bake, three-quarters of an hour; to steam, one hour.

  We find several recipes in the Internet called "Irish Potato candy."  None offer
  history regarding the name/origin of the confection. In fact? Some employ
  ingredients that are quite definately NOT connected with Ireland, such as peanut
  butter. Perhaps the Irish connection is the fact that these recipes employ white
  (Irish) potatoes, rather than sweet potatoes (which are orange in color). Curiously,
  we do not find any potato candies in our historic British confectionery texts (Skuse),
  or candy reference books (Laura Mason), books on potatoes (Zuckerman), or Irish
  culinary sources.

middle ages
(Jordan <a href="foodcandy.html#almonds">almonds</a> & <a href="foodcakes.html#dragees">dragees</a>), food historians generally attribute the
"invention" of the praline to

in the 17th century. Presumably, these confections were transported to Lousiana by French settlers.

"Sugar almonds. Almonds coated with a layer of fine sugar, as for dragees...Sugar almonds play
an
important role in rites of passage, particularly christenings and weddings, at which they are
offered as
symbols of good fortune. This custom is strong in France, Greece, Italy, other Mediterranean
countries, and
as far east as Iran and Afghanistan where they are known as noql...As a New Year offering they
are
supposed to ensure that the mouths and lives of the recipients will remain sweet for the whole of
the
coming year. Less sophisticated versions of almond dragees are sometimes made at home by
cooking
almonds, or other nuts, such as hazel, in sugar syrup and then stirring the mixture till it  grains.'
The
almonds, with some of the sugar clinging to them, are separated and dried. Many 17th- and
18th-century
praline recipes are of this type."<br>

"Praline. A combination of almonds and boiled sugar, is a popular confection with a long history.
The name
is originally French, and the Dictionnarie de l'epicerie (1898) gives this definition" 
Praline.--Bonbon forme
d'une amande rissole dans du sucre dont ell form ensuite le noyeay, et parfue it colore de diverse
manieres.' The important points in this definition are that it refers to almonds which are whole and
separate,
each covered with boiled, grained sugar. This remains the primary meaning of the word in modern
French.
According to the often-repeated but unverifiable legend dating back to the end of the 18th century
at least,
the name  praline' is derived from the Duke of Plessis-Praslin (1589-1675). His cook is supposed
to have
invented a method for coating whole almonds in grained caramelized sugar, and later to have
retired to the
to produce the sweets commerically. Whatever the truth, pralines were well known, outside as
well as
inside France, but the 18th century, when recipes for  Prawlins', or for  Almonds Crisped'
appeared in
English cookery books. Borella (1770) observed that ;praline' is  French Anglicized, as there is no
English
word to express the real idea of the French in this sort of preserving almonds.' Eventually,
however, praline,
like many other French culinary terms, became an adopted word in the English language. As an
English
word, praline now has the main meaning of a powdered nut-and-sugar confection, the nuts
commonly (but
not exclusively) used being almonds...In North America pralines are a specialty of several
southern states.
In Louisiana, especially New Orleans, the name applies to candies made with pecans in a coating
of brown
sugar which used to be sold by Creole women known as pralinieres."<br>

"Praline...The praline is a specialty of Montargis, where its inventor, Lassagne, who was chef de

"We owe it [praline] to Lassagne...One day, in the servants' quarters of his residence at
Montargis,
Lassagne found his children caramelizing almonds almonds stolen from the kitchens. The
wonderful odour
emanating from the spot where the little cooks were at work gave away their guilty secret and its
delicious
results. His mouth watering, Lassagne promsed to keep quiet in exchange for some of the
sweetmeats. He
perfected the recipe and took it to the court of Louis XIII, where the confection became known
as prasline,
not that the duke himself had anything to do with inventing it. Another sotry holds that the reicpe
was the
result of clumsiness on the part of an apprentice, who dropped some almonds into caramel made
with
Gatinais honey. Whatever the truth of the matter was, Lassagne retired to Montargis and opened
a
confectioner's shop there, the Maison de la prasline, which still exits and is as good as a museum.

<b>Pralines in the USA</b><p>
"Praline. A Confection made from almonds or pecans and caramel. It is a great favorite of the
South,
especially in New Orleans, and derives from the French preparation of praline, caramelized
almonds or
hazelnuts and sugar pounded into a fine, crumblike texture, Both terms come from the name of
French
diplomat Cesar du Plessis-Praslin, later duc de Choisuel (1598-1675), whose cook suggested that
almonds
and sugar aided digestion. The American Creoles substituted pecans for the almonds. The
confection is
first mentioned in print in 1715, and part of Louisiana food culture as early as 1762. The term had
various
meaning by 1809, when one chronicler told of pralines made from corn and sugar."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Sauerkraut candy</b></font><br>
Confectioners are brilliant when it comes to creating novel items. Some pieces are highly crafted;
others are assembled with cheap ingredients to feed a popular frenzy. "Sauerkraut Candy" is a little of both.
This particular confection combines coconut and sugar to achieve a product that looks like sauerkraut. Why on 
earth would someone "invent" this? We wondered too.
<p>
Food historians confirm <a href="foodfaq.html#coconuts">coconut</a> (aka cocoanut) has been a popular ingredient in American
foods from colonial days forward. Fresh, dried or dessicated, coconuts flavored American desserts.
19th century technological advances made cocoanut cheap and plentiful. Coconut candy recipes proliferated. 
Our survey of historic newspapers suggest Sauerkraut candy originated in the northern American Midwest (Wisconsin, Iowa)
in the early 20th century. This region was home to great waves of Northern
European immigrants who enjoyed sauerkraut and sausages. An inexpensive novelty confection resembling beloved sauerkraut,
and promoted as such, makes perfect sense in this context.

<b>Bologna candy?</b><br>
Like <a href="foodcandy.html#sauerkraut">Sauerkraut Candy</a>, Bologna Candy (aka Sausage Candy) is a cheap 20th century confection crafted to visually resemble its
namesake. Novel idea, yes?

"Bologna Made of Candy</b><br>
You can use cream scrap in this type if you desire; if you do, place in a kettle<br>
30 pounds scrap<br>
20 pounds corn syrup<br>
Water to dissolve<br>
Cook to 234 degrees F., add all the shredded cocoanut it will stand, then add a few blanched almonds or Brazil nuts to represent the
fat in the sausage. Also add chocolate to flavor and red color; do not use too much color but just so the batch will be a kind of reddish brown. Now pour
 batch on slab and work into round rolls a little over two inches thick and about fifteen inches in length. It is necessary to have a heavy wire
suspended across your shop when you are making this piece. Have the wire up before starting batch. Now wrap the strips of candy bologna in heavy sheets of 
wax paper; be sure to keep them round all the time, then tie up the end of the wax paper so that the whole sheet of oiled paper will keep
the bologna in the desired shape. Hang each of these pieces from the heavy wire and let them remain undisturbed for about twelve to 
fifteen hours, then remove the wax paper and cut into slices of about a half inch in thickness. You will find this cuts very smoothly and
is nice eating. In cutting, cut on an angle just as butchers do, then your piece will still be more imitative. If yo do not wish
to use cream scrap in making this batch, use 20 pounds of sugar to 20 pounds of corn syrup, then proceed the same."<br>

<b>Laura Mason, British culinary expert, observes:</b><br>

"...Scottish tablet, which is similar to a crisp version of fudge--brown, sugary, with a characteristic flavour derived from sugar and milk cooked together. A version was known in the eighteenth century when Lady Grisell Baillie recorded purchases of 'Taiblet for the bairns' in her household book between 1692-1733. Recipes for tablets flavoured with orange, rose, cinnamon and ginger were published in Glasgow by Mrs. McLintock in 1736. These are simple candy recipes, made only with sugar, water and flavourings. This is her recipe: "Orange Tablets with the Grate: Grate the Oranges, take 2 lib. of sugar, and a mutchkin of water, then clarify it with the White of 2 Eggs, and set it on a slow Fire, and boil it till it be almost candyed, then put in the Grate of the Oranges, and take your white paper, rub it with fresh Butter, pour it on your Paper, and cut in little pieces." This is a candy similar to those from the previous century. The word tablet has medicinal overtones, as in the commonly accepted meaning of a small flat disc containing some drug or health-giving substance...In tablet now made in Scotland, both orange and ginger are still found amongst the flavourings, but milk has become essential to the defiintion."

 essence or grate of lemon pounded, in the proportion wanted for flavouring the article to be made. Two drops of oil of cinnamon, a half-ounce of ginger, or the 
grate of two lemons, is a medium quantity to a pound of sugar. Mix the flavouring ingredient very well with the boiling sugar, and pour it out when boiled

Put into an enamelled saucepan two pounds of granulated sugar and three teacupfuls of thin cream or milk. Bring it gradually to the boiling-point, stirring all the time. Let it

remove the pan from the fire. Add flavouring as below. Now put the pan into a basin of cold water and stir rapidly with a spoon. It soon begins to solidify round the edge,

<a name="rockcandy">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Rock candy</b></font><br>
<b>What exactly is rock candy?</b><br>
Excellent question with several answers. We Americans think of this as crystalized sugar sold on a stick or 
piece of string, often found in "old timey" stores. This was not always the case. British confectionery historian Laura Mason explains:
 "The name 'rock' leads to more confusion. To nineteenth-century confectioners,
rock could mean pulled sugar, as in the modern definition, but it could also mean rock candy, large crystals grown on sticks in
sugar solutions, or 'rock sugar', made from royal icing foamed by the addition of hot syrup." [<i>Sugarplums and Sherbet: The 
Prehistory of Sweets</i>, Laura Mason Prospect Books:Devon 2004 (p. 95)]. Historically, "rock" candy was often poured on a slab and cut or
and cut into shapes (regular or random)or molded into fancier presentations. Our survey of historic coookbooks confirms recipes titled
"rock" produced distinctly different products.
<p>
When did "rock candy," as we know it today, first appear?</b><br>
Our survey of historic cookbooks and newspapers confirms "rock candy" first surfaces in the first quarter of the 19th 
century. Newspaper ads published throughout the USA were for commerical products without description. 
We cannot tell from this evidence exactly what product was being sold with that name. The earliest
print references we find to crystallized sugar sold in string format is from the last quarter of the 19th century. These
items were not marketed as candy. They were cough medicine. Curative claims combining whisky and rock sugar were 
contoversial and not universally sanctioned by medical professionals. It is not until the early 20th century we find
crystallized "rock candy" marketed as a confection. Even then, the colors were controversial. Think: Pure Food and Drug
Act of 1906. In the mid-1950s <i>Weekly Reader</i>, a popular children's newspaper used in schools, featured an article
about making rock candy as a fun science experiment. We Baby Boomers remember this fun project.

sugar evaporated into large crystals or crystalline masses. The necessary ingredients are a supersaturated sugar solution, a pices of
string and plenty of time. To make rock candy, the home economist suggests boiling two cups of sugar in one cup of water to 
242 degrees F. on a candy thermometer or until a bit of the solution, dropped into cold water, forms a soft ball. Remove the colution from
the heat, allow it to cool, then pour it into an earthenware or glass container. Suspend a string into the solution, first tying one end to a 
strip of wood that can be rested across the mouth of the container. Or, insert a long, clean twig into this solution. The string
or twig is necessary so that the sugar crystals will have something to which htey can cling as they form. All that is left to do is to
wait, and it is only fair to warn that it will be a long wait. It wil take several weeks before all the liquid has evaporated and the
crystals have formed into rock candy. The rock candy can be crystal clear or it can be tinted in delicate hues by adding a few
drops of food coloring to the hot liquid."<br>

<b>Rum balls</b><br>
Food historians generally place the origin of rum balls (bourbon balls, brandy balls, apricot balls) in the
1940s, one decade after <a href="foodcookies.html#nobakes">no-bake confections</a> became popular. Like stuffed dates, they were popular American homemade winter
 holiday gifts in the 1950s-1960s. Presumably, the confection recalls earlier
days when holiday sweets of composed of nuts, spices, sweeteners and spirits (think: confits, sugarplums, fruitcake, 
rum cake) were standard fare. 
<p>
Our survey of early American recipes confirms rum was a popular baked goods ingredient. This
particular spirit, like its cousins brandy, port and madeira, served double duty as food flavoring and preservative agent.
 The difference between the old recipes and today's products? Method. Traditional colonial/early American products 
featuring alcoholic ingredients were baked. Contemporary American Rum Balls are not. While it is totally possible rum ball-type
recipes have been around for hundreds of years, we have no print proof. All historic points on the culinary history 
compass place rum balls in the mid-20th century.
<p>
"There was one other liquor-accented sweet recipe that swept the country in the Sixties and
that was bourbon or rum balls. Because they involved no cooking and were based on
ultrafashionable graham cracker or cookie crumbs, nuts, and alcohol, bourbon balls were the
perfect sweet morsel of the era. The were, and are, addicting...These little cookie confections
are usually reserved for the Christmas season."<br>

The history of taffy (and its British counterpart, toffee), and <a
href="foodcandy.html#butterscotch">butterscotch</a>  are intertwined. When were these
confections invented? No one quite knows for certain. Food historians generally agree that
taffy/toffee first became popular in the 1800s. Possible precursor? <a href="foodcandy.html#tablet">Tablet</a>.
<p>
The basic ingredients for taffy/ toffee were readily available to European cooks during the Roman
occupation. <a href="foodcandy.html#treacle">Treacle</a> (a uncrystalized syrup produced during sugar refining) was routinely employed
to make cakes and gingerbread during the Middle Ages. Karen Hess notes treacle was considered
to have medicinal value, which explains why it became the sweetener of choice during these times.
(<i>Martha Washington's Booke of Cookery</i>, transcribed by Karen Hess [p. 200-1]). C. Anne
Wilson
confirms "Molasses was rather slow in coming into general use as a sweetener, due perhaps to the
influence of the apothecaries and treaclemongers." (<i>Food and Drink in Britain From the Stone
Age to the 19th Century</i> [p.304]). Northern European cooks typically used butter [rather than
oil] for cooking because it was readily available.
<p>
<a name="toffee">
<b>How old is toffee?</b><br>
According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, toffee ("a sweet meat made from sugar or
treacle,
butter, and sometimes a little flour, boiled together; often mixed with bruised nuts such as almond
or walnut toffee") was first mentioned in print in 1825. We know that most words are typically
used long before they appear in print form.
<p>
"Toffee...the modern British name for a sweet formerly called 'taffy.' The older name survives in
the USA, but British toffee and American taffy are not quite the same....Welsh forms of toffee
(variously called taffi, ffani, or cyflaith) are much more like American taffy. In particular, they are
usually pulled, as is most American taffy. The agreeable custom of taffy-pulling parties has
survived up to modern times in parts of Wales, while it is probably extinct in England. "<br>
---<i>The Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson, [Oxford University Press:Oxford]
1999 (p. 797-798)
<p>
"Toffee became popular around 1800, a time when sugar and treacle (a sugar syrup like molasses)
had become cheap. Early references to toffee all come from the north of England and often
mention friends getting together to boil treacle with flour to make a sticky treat.  Improvements to
the basic mixture included adding cream a speciality of Devonshire or butter to make a richly
flavoured confection. Buttery toffee is often called butterscotch, which suggests it was invented in
Scotland. But the word was first recorded in the Yorkshire town of Doncaster, where Samuel
Parkinson began making it in 1817. Possibly the "scotch" part of its name derives from "scorch"
rather than from Scotland. As for the word "toffee," an early spelling is "toughy" or "tuffy,"
probably a reference to the confection's teeth-sticking toughness."<br>

"Speculation is possibe on [toffee's] origin as a festive food, perhaps associated with Halloween or All Souls...Special foods for these days
 undoubtedly existed...Jamieson, in his <i>Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language</i> (1825) defined taffie as a mixture of treacle and
flour boiled together, eaten at Halloween. The ingredients could have been more seasonal than they appear to us. Before the eighteenth century, butter
would have been most plentiful in early autumn, as would honey (molasses or treacle were often substituted one they became common). It's easy to imagine that
the poorer members of the community boiled up a simple sweetmeat for All Saints Day, maybe something ressembling a cross between one of the solid medieval
gingerbreads and a robust treacle toffee. What is certain is that in the Victorian period an ancestor of Bonfire toffee or 'Plot' toffee (...Nov. 5th) was popular
in west Yorkshire...The north Wales tradition was to have a toffee-pull around Christmas or New Year, with friends and family joining in...Taffy-pulls or candy-
pulls became a custom in North America too...Taffy, first recorded in 1817, is considered to be the earliest version of the word toffee. Some writers at the time
speculated that the word described the toughness of a pulled sweet, and that should really be 'tough'or 'toughy', although this is now discounted. Taffy in North
Americca...definately means a pulled sweet."<br>

<b>What is taffy?</b><br>
The earliest written reference to taffy in the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> dates back to
1817: "R. Wilbraham, Cheshire Glossary, Taffy,...a treacle thickened by boiling and made into hard cakes." 
<a href="foodcandy.html#saltwater"">Salt water taffy</a> appeared at the end of the 19th century.
<p>
"Taffy. A confection made from sugar, butter, and flavorings that has a chewy texture obtained by
twisting and pulling the cooked ingredients into elasticity. The British term for such candy is
toffee or toffy, possibly from tafia, a cheap West Indian rum made from molasses and used
originally to flavor candy. The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> notes that taffy...seems to refer
to an older form of the candy. By the 1870s taffy bakes and taffy pulls, at which young people would
gather to stretch the candy between them, had become social occasions."<br>

[Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 321)
<p>
"In the 1840s...candy pulls  became popular, being called taffy pulls by the late 1870s, when taffy
also came to be a slang word for flattery. Taffy (British toffee) was simple to make, from
molasses or brown sugar and butter, and the taffy pulls entertained young and old alike and were
a suitable face-to-face pastime for courting couples. Salt water taffy became associated with the
Atlantic City Boardwalk by the 1880s, and the box of neatly wrapped pastel  rows of taffy became
its typical souvenir."<br>

<b>Taffy/toffee recipes</b><br>
In 19th century American and British cookbooks, the names toffee and taffy appear to be used
interchangeably to denote similar recipes. This confection also sometimes masked as "molasses
candy" or "pulled molasses candy." Some of these recipes instruct the cook to "pull" the candy,
others simply to cut it in small squares. Some refer specifically to "Everton Toffie," named for a
town near Liverpool, England. <br>
<blockquote>
<b>[1845]<br>
"Everton Toffie</b><br>
No. 1:--Put into a brass skillet or small preserving pan three ounces of very fresh butter, and as soon as it is just
melted add a pound of brown sugar or moderate quality; keep these stirred gently over a very clear fire for about fifteen
miutes, or until a little of the mixture, dropped into a basin of cold water breaks clean between the teeth without sticking
to them: when it is boiled to this point it must be poured out immediately, or it will burn. The grated rind of a lemon, added
wehn the toffie is half done, improves it much; or a small teaspoonful of powdered ginger moistened with a little of the other
ingredients as soon as the sugar is dissolved and then stirred to the whole, will vary it pleasantly to many tastes. The Real
Everton toffie is made with a much larger proportion of butter, but it is the less wholesome on that very account. If dropped upon
dishes first rubbed with a buttered paper, the toffie when cold can be raised from them easily.<br>

<b>About salt water taffy</b><br>
Salt water taffy</a> is popularly
attributed to Fralingers, on the Atlantic City NJ boardwalk, 1883. 
Our survey of historic newspaper articles reveals there were several claimants to the origination of 
this seaside treat. Not surprisingly? The issue became a matter of court record.
<p>
"Mr. Fralinger retired from business several years ago. Though he was widely known as the 'Salt Water Taffy King,' the claim that he
was the originator of the taffy has been disputed. He was one of the first to manufacture it however, and probably did more than
anybody else to popularize it."<br>
---"Joseph Fralinger Dies," <i>New York Times</i>, May 14, 1927 (p. 19)
<p>
"Fralingers,'s Inc., the oldest original business on the Boardwalk, has been making and selling saltwater taffy since 1885 at the
same location, Tennessee Avenue and the Boardwalk, where Joseph Fralinger set up his stand a century ago. Mr. Fralinger did not create
saltwater taffy, but he was, by all accounts, its most successful merchandiser...According to Arthur H. Gager 3d...the founder of the family business
first took note of taffy in a letter to a relative, written in 1883 in which the candy was referred to as 'Ocean Wave,' 'Sea Foam,'
and 'Salt Water Taffy.' How it got the name saltwater taffy is a pleasant Atlantic City fable. It is said that a Mr. Cassidy and
a Mr. Bradley--nobody knows for sure--had a taffy stand and that  one night a northeaster hit the Boardwalk, overturning
everything and washing the sea over his stock. The next day a girl came by, tasted a piece of the candy and asked, 'Is this
saltwater taffy?'...Mr. Gager says is that the name was coined 'simply because of the proximity of the water to the Atlantic 
City beach and the Boardwalk.'"<br>
---"100 Years the Tons of Taffy Later...," Fred Ferretti, <i>New York Times</i>, June 12, 1985 (p. C3)
<p>
<b>Who were the other contenders & what was the outcome of the legal battle?</b><br>
"About sixty years ago a man had a small candy store on the Atlantic City waterfront--which, in those remote days, had no grand 
Boardwalk, as it now has, raised many inches above the sea. One morning when he opened up for business he found that a recent hight
tide had flooded his stock during the night. 'As he stood tearing his hair, a little girl came in with some pennies in her hand.
'Please, sir, half a pound of taffy,' she said. 'Here's some salt water taffy,' groaned the storekeeper, handing her a package of
sea-soaked candy. Munching delightedly, she returned to her parents on the beach. 'It's salt water taffy,' she said: the man told
me so.' They started munching also, with a delight equal to hers. 'The candy merchant's mother happened to witness the scene. At
once an idea sprang, full-fledged, into her brain. She rushed to her son's flooded shop. 'When you make your next batch of candy, 
mix it with salt water!' she told him.'He did. Others did..."<br>

"John Ross Edmiston Sr.,...claimed to have originated 'saltwater taffy,'...Mr. Edmiston, born at Tyroe, Pa., was graduated from 
Lebanon (Pa.) Business College and had been a penmanship teacher. He used the name of salt water taffy shortly after he
opened a confectionery store in Atlantic City in 1884. Mr. Edmiston first opened his shore store at the ocean end of the boardwalk
at South Carolina Avenue. He had been making the candy for some time when his customers insisted that he give it a name. One day, 
the sea splashed into his stand, wetting a quantity of the candy which was cooling on a slab. Fearful lest the salt water had ruined
his batch, Mr. Edmiston found that the water had not penetrated into the candy and the thought struck him to call it 'salt water 
taffy.'"<br>

"With millions at stake in royalties and the future of their industry in jeopardy, about 500 candy manufacturers in this country, 
chiefly along the Atlantic seaboard, have won the right, after months of litigation, to continue using the trademark 'salt
water taffy.' The decision was given by the United States Supreme Court. The right to exclusive use of the trademark was
claimed by John R. Edmiston of Wildwood, N.J. in 1923. He contended he was the originator and the only one to manufacture
'salt water taffy' for ten years prior to 1905. His petition for registration of the trade-mark was granted by the United States
Patent Office officials. Edmiston then notified all other manufacturers of the confection to cease using the trade-mark and served
notice that he would collect royalties on all taffy made since 1895. These royalties would have run into millions. The fisght for the 
confectioners was made by James Brothers of this city, beginning in August, 1924, resulting in a decision that the term 'salt water taffy'
cannot be registered."<br>

"Candy interest are following with close attention a temporary victory for manufacturers who contend that John R. Edmiston of Wildwood, 
N.J., has not the exclusive right to use the trademark 'Salt Water Taffy.' The examiner for interferences of the Patent Office 
has ruled that Mr. Edmiston is not entitled to sole use of this trade name. When Mr. Edmiston filed application for his trade mark some
years ago, the Patent Office decided that the name was 'descriptive' and therefore he would have to apply under a proviso that for 
ten years previous to 1905 he had, to the best of his knowledge and belief, been entitled to the trade name. Under such an
application thirty days are left open for any one to file an opposition, but this was not done.  Under a proviso, however, contendants
may at any time apply for a cancellation of the registration, and this application has been made by James Brothers of Atlantic
City, representing a large number of candy manufacturers. The examiner for interferences now has ruled against Mr. Edmiston. The
latter has until April 15 to appeal from this decision to the Commissioner of Patents...The Edmiston appeal has not yet been
filed."<br>

<b>Butterscotch</b><br>
The history of butterscotch is closely connected to that of toffee/taffy. It is essentially the same
recipe tempered with lemon flavoring. Exact recipes (molasses, white sugar, brown, sugar, corn
syrup) vary greatly according to time and place. Food historians have several theories regarding
the name of this candy and its connection to Scotland; none of them conclusive. Theodora
Fitzgibbon (Scottish culinary expert) includes a recipe for butterscotch in her <i>Scottish
Cookery</i> (p.260), without comment.

"Buttery toffee is often called butterscotch, which suggests it was invented in
Scotland. But the word was first recorded in the Yorkshire town of Doncaster, where Samuel
Parkinson began making it in 1817. Possibly the "scotch" part of its name derives from "scorch"
rather than from Scotland."<br>

"Butterscotch, a toffee-like confection of sugar and butter, is first heard of in the mid-nineteenth

<b>ABOUT CARAMEL</b><p>
The term "caramel" has two meanings: the highest stage of heated sugar (also
caramelized/caramelization) and a confection (candy). According to the food historians,
caramelization was practiced in France in the 17th century. <a href="foodcandy.html#praline">Pralines</a> are
an example of a caramelized confection. Caramel candies, as we think of them today, surfaced in
the 18th century. The are related to <a href="foodcandy.html#toffee">toffee</a>. In addition to candy, caramel
has several other applications. These include: flavoring (caramel custard), sauce (popular with ice
cream), and coating (caramel corn).
<p>
"Caramel is sugar which has been cooked until it turns brown. The word <i>caramel</i> is a
comparatively late introduction into English: it is first recorded in 1725. It came via French from
Spanish caramelo, but its previous history is speculative; its most likely source is perhaps late
Latin calamellus, a diminutive form of Latin calamus,  'reed, cane' (the implied reference being to
 'sugarcane'). The sweets caramels, a soft form of toffee, are made with sugar and milk, butter, or
cream."<br>

"The five terms--<i>lisse</I> or smooth, pearl, blow, feather, and casse or break--remained
standard [confectionery terms] during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. They were split
into  lower' and higher', which then became regarded as degrees in their own right. The term
<i>caramel</i> was added. Confusingly for the modern reader, this indicated the degree just
before the sugar begins to colour. It is now regarded as the hard crack stage. Such attention to
detail implies that confectionery became very accomplished during the eighteenth century, but,
despite this, written instructions were often inconsistent and blase...Confectioners remained
circumspect about boiling sugar higher than feather...Higher degrees came into use gradually. In
the sixteenth century, only apothecaries were confident with them. In the next, Rose translated
one recipe which required sugar boiled to casse or break. In the eighteenth, sugar boiled to the
highest degree, <i>grand casse</i>, or <i>caramel</i>, had a limited use. Massailot said that
caramel was proper for  Barley-sugar and certain small Sugar-works call'd by that name.' His
compatriot J. Gilliers, writing in 1751, described caramel as sugar boiled to casse. It was
coloured, and used for figures to decorate the table. Other confectioners used caramel for
decorative purposes and do not seem to have made many boiled-sugar sweets of the type now
familiar. Only at the beginning of the next century did Jarrin make it clear that he included
browned sugar in the term caramel."<br>

"Toffee recieved a boost in the 1880s when caramels, a North American innovation, were
introduced. Caramels relied
on slowly boiled sugar and milk to give a delicious flavour. Skuse wrote that these sweets were 
sold very freely on the
lowest and poorest quarters of London, at two-pence per ounce; in the West End the same goods
fetch double that price.'
They were also suitable for mass production. Coconut oil substitutes were developed to replace
the dairy products, and
automatic stirrers replaced human endeavour at the boiling pan. Confectioners began experiments.
In 1890 John
Mackintosh opened a shop in Halifax. Shortly afterwards, he created Mackintosh's Celebrated

<b>What did British confectioners think of American caramels at the turn of the 20th
century?</b><br>
"Caramels. When first brought over from America, these goods were certainly a treat. The were
rather dear, but they
were good; the public appreciated them. Very soon the demand was universal, then competition
stepped in with the
usual result--the prices lowered, the quality suffered, until anything cut into the shape were called
caramels.
Consequently, the demand lessened; still they were forced on the market cheaper and cheaper,
worse and worse, until
only those who liked plenty of money bought the vile concoctions. The very name has almost
become a synonym for
rubbish. However, several makers had kept up the standard of excellence, so that only those
which are identified by a
particular brand or name find favour with the retail shopkeepers who study the interest of their
customers, but the
mischief has already been done to the great bulk of the general trade; the public has lost
confidence, and are afraid to buy
that which they woudl like, having so often got that which they did not like, bearing the same
name and having the same
appearance as their former favorites. To remedy this state of things as far a possible, we
recommend the making of an
excellent article from good and fresh ingredients, using a distinctive name or brand, and, above all,
keep the quality up to
the standard. Better please old customers with prime goods than try to deceive new ones with
cheap and common
confectionery goods."<br>

The practice of coating fruit in sugar syrup dates to ancient times. Honey and sugar were used as
preserving agents. Food historians generally agree that toffee apples (aka taffy apples, caramel
candied apples, candy apples, lollipop apples) probably date to the late 19th century, although difficult to prove in print. Both
<a href="foodcandy.html#toffee">toffee and caramel</a> are traced to the early decades of the 18th century.
Inexpensive toffee/caramels became available by the end of the 19th century. Culinary evidence
confirms a variety of recipes, from hard colored sugar to soft chewy caramel coating.
<p>
<b>What is "candied fruit?"</b><p>
     "The use of cane sugar slowly spread outward from Bengal. In the seventh century
     A.D., the Chinese emporer Tai-Hung sent workmen to Gur to learn the art of
     sugar refining, and by the tenth century camel caravans were carrying "sand sugar"
     north through the empty deserts to Europe. This newsly arrived cane sugar was
     initially regarded as a spice, and in medieval Europe was used principally as a
     medicine. It was enormously expensive and was therefore only available to the
     wealthiest households. Nevertheless, sugar gradually began to be more widely
     appreciated for its appetizing sweetness in sweetmeats, confectionery, and
     desserts, while it was increasingly valued also as a preserving agent for fresh fruits.
     Sweetmeats had appeared on the menu of the most sumptuous feasts and banquets
     of the Romans, the Athenians, and in Byzantium, and the most wealthy and noble
     households of the European Middle Ages adopted these delicacies for their own
     tables. These sweetmeats were considered a digestive to clear the palate...Good
     hosts weven placed little decorated comfit boxes filled with sugared almonds,
     pralines, nougats, candied spiced preserves and lemon peel, marzipan made with
     ground almond paste, egg whites, and sugar, and crystallized fruits, flowers, and
     angelica for the delectation of their guests in the privacy of their chambers. It was
     believed that sugar helped their digestion...Candying, probably developed in the
     Middle East, is a very slow process of replacing the natural juices of the fruit with
     the sugar solution or syrup. As in some fruit-drying processes, citrus peel and
     some hard fruits are first soaked in strong brine or acid solution to draw out some
     of the liquid before boiling and to encourage the fruit to absorb more sugar. Once
     candied, the fruits can be "crystallized" by painting them with egg white and
     dusting liberally with sugar...Once sugared, the fruit or flower is the left to dry out
     in a warm,well ventilated place." <br>

     One the THE best books on the history of confectionery (all kinds) is Laura Mason's
  <i>Sugarplums and Sherbet: The Prehistory of Sweets</i> [Prospect Books:Devon] 2004
  ISBN 1903018285. This source traces the origins of candy evolving from honey and
  refined sugar. Candying, Ms. Mason notes, was a method employed in ancient times for
  fruit preservation. Candied fruit could be dried or stored with syrup in airtight containers.
  While the book does not specifically address candied apples it does contain a passage which is on point:  <p>
  "Preserved fruit had been a status symbol for centuries. Before canning, freezing and air
  freight, sugar was the only medium of conservation available...Originally, the technique
  was used for more than merely keeping the fruit from rotting. Fresh fruit was regarded as
  suspect by physicians, who thought it mostly 'cold' in humoral terms. In the seventeeth
  century, Tobias Venner thought quinces, peaches, and apricots cold and dry, apples and
  pears cold and moist with a 'crude and windie moisture'...Preserving with sugar (which
  was moderately hot) made delicious sweetmeats that tempered the coldness of the
  fruit...Fruit sweetmeats, including a few using honey, can be traced back to the earliest
  collections of recipes. The confectioner faced with a glut of fruit had three options:
  preserve it whole (in syrup or candied); cook to a homogenous paste; extract the fruit and
  boil it with sugar to make a jelly. In skilful hands all three were exploited for decorative,
  beautifully coloured and flavoured sweetmeats. Preserving whole involved a serious
  attempt to conserve the integrity of fruits to that they appeared as natural as possible. All
  recipes for preserves or "suckets' begain by cooking fruit gently, and then steeping in
  syrup over several days. The syrup was concentrated by boiling a little more each
  day...Finallly, fruit and syrup were transferred to gallipots or glasses and sealed with
  bladder or paper until needed. Drained, the preserves could be sprinkled with fine sugar,
  or candied by dipping them in sugar boiled to candy eight so encasing each piece in a
  sugar shell. This method uses syrups boiled to relatively low temperatures. Candied fruits
  are still made with varying degrees of skill in France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and their
  former colonies. The quantities of sugar required, as well as the time and expertise, make
  these expensive and luxurious sweetmeats even now." (p. 109-111)

  <b>About toffee apples</b><br>
  "Toffee apple. A popular confection on Britian, especially in the autumn, when they used
  to be
  prominent, with their vivid red color, at autumn fairs. A whole, fresh apple, on a thin stick,
  is
  dipped in a high-boiled sugar syrup which has been colored red; and allowed to set before
  wrapping in cellophane. The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> gives on quotations
  relating to
  toffee apples earlier than the beginning of the 20th century. However, the use of the term
  as a
  soldier's slang for a type of bomb used in the first World War suggests that they were
  already well
  known, and probably have a longer history than the quotations allow. In the phrase 'toffee
  apple'
  the word  'toffee' means simple boiled sugar, not the mixture of sugar and dairy produce
  which is
  what the word usually refers to. This may be another indication of an older origin of the
  toffee
  apple...There is some similarity between toffee apples and the Chinese dessert items which
  consist
  of pieces of banana or apple fried in batter and then coated in a caramelized syrup.

href="http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/display.cfm?TitleNo=13&PageNum=456">"Candied or
  Crystallized Fruit of Nuts"</a> which approximates the formula described by Mr.
  Davidson. It does not, however, mention the use of apples
  
  
  <p>
  The oldest recipe we have for toffee apples is this:<br><blockquote>
  <p>
  <b>"Apples on a stick. </b><br>
  Take small apples and stick in each one at the top, a small wooden skewer, such as
  butchers use
  to pin roasts. Now cook a batch of Molasses Taffy to 280 degress F. Then dip the apple in
  the hot
  batch so as to cover it completely. Let the surplus syrup drip off, then stand them on a slab
  until
  cold."<br>
  ---<i>Rigby's Reliable Candy Teacher</i>, W.O. Rigby, 19th edition [USA] 1919?  (p.
  215)<br>
  [NOTE: this book contains two recipes for molasses taffy, p. 144 and 145.]
  <p>
<b>[1924]<br>
"Lollipop Apples</b><br>
Select very small red apples, wash and dry them, put a stick or skewer in each, and dip them in the glace."
<p>
<b>Glace</b><br>
Glace or glace sugar is used for the dipping of nuts and fruits and for the making of various hard candies. It is an 
exceedingly pure form of candy, very easily made, yet requiring careful watching, as it quickly clouds, and obviuosly, when not 
clear, its beautiful effect is lost. It is from glace that the spun sugar nests used chiefly for their decorative purposes
are made. The remains of glace, after dipping nuts and candies, may be very delicately coloured, flavoured with a few drops of
cinnamon, clove, lemon, or any other desired extract and dropped or poured on  to an oiled slab or platter in the form
of small candies. <br>
1 pound sugar, 1/8 pound cream of tartar, 2/3 cupful water<br>
Place all the ingredients in a small saucepan, stir only until the sugar has dissolved, then cook to 320 degrees. Remove 
immediately from the fire and drip whole or half nuts and candy centres, one at a time, into the syrup, gently, so as not
to disturb it and make it cloudy. Lift them out immediately with the candy fork and turn on to an oiled slab or platter or
table oilcloth to set."<br>

  Food historians tell us sweet, gummy, fruit-flavored molded candies were first made by
  Arab cooks in the Middle Ages. Recipes were introduced to Europe by returning
  Crusaders. These early candies inspired many candies we know today, including
  gumdrops, <a href="foodcandy.html#jellybeans">jelly beans</a>, <a href="foodcandy.html#jujubes">jujubes</a>, Gummi Bears and Swedish Fish. Recipes evolved with
  advances in technology. The 19th century introduction of corn syrup and man-made
  gelatine (for the jelly) made it possible for these candies to be made cheaply. Which
  meant? More people could afford and enjoy them.
  19th century English jelly candies (of all sorts) were called Turkish Delights:
  <p>
  "Turkish delight is a gelatinous sweet of Turkish origin, coated in powdered sugar. It is variously flavored
  and coloured, although the variety most commonly seen in the West is made with rose water, and is
  consequently pink. It is cut into cubes, and was originally called in English  lumps of delight', a term
  Dickens needed to explain in 1870: "I want to got the the Lumps-of-Delight shop," "To the-?" "A Turkish
  sweetmeat, sir"' (Mystery of Edwin Drood). The name Turkish delight itself is first recorded in 1877. The
  Turkish term for the sweet is rahat lokum, a borrowing from Arabic rahat al-hulqum, which literally means
   throat's ease."<br>
