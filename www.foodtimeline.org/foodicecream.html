Food historians tell us the history of ice cream begins with ancient flavored ices. The Chinese are
generally credited for creating the first ice creams, possibly as early as 3000 BC. Marco Polo is
popularly cited for introducing these tasty concoctions to Italy. This claim (as well as his
introducing <a href="foodfaq2.html#pasta">pasta</a> to Italy) are questionable.  The ice creams
we enjoy today are said to have been invented in <a href="foodicecream.html#gelato">Italy</a> during the 17th century. They spread
northward through Europe via France. <a href="foodicecream.html#frenchicecream">"French-style"</a> ice cream (made with egg yolks) and its American counterpart,
<a href="foodicecream.html#philadelphiaicecream">"Philadelphia-style,"</a> are (no eggs, or egg whites only) enriched products made with the finest ingredients. 
<a href="foodfaq2.html#vanilla">Vanilla</a> is the most popular flavor
of this genre. Food historians tell us this type of ice cream originated in the 17th century and
proliferated in the early 18th. 
<p>
As time and technology progressed, ice cream flavors (Pistachio, Rocky Road, Chunky
Monkey), complicated confections (19th century Neapolitan bricks, <a
href="foodicecream.html#icecreamcake">English bombes &
American cakes</a>), and novelty concoctions (<a href="foodicecream.html#hokeypokey">hokey-pokey

<b>Why do we call it "ice cream?"</b><br>
Excellent question! Centuries ago people started making refreshing summer-time desserts by taking sweet cream (the richest part of milk) or custard (egg-based puddings) and cooling them down with ice. The chillier the 
 cream, the more solid the product. In sum: the first "iced creams" were so named because the appelation described the process. Seasonal fruit flavors predominated. Different words were used in
 other languages. Before modern refrigeration mostly wealthy people had access to ice (and by association, iced cream) in the summer. This made ice cream a rare 
treat. It was not until the late 19th century "ice cream" was consumed by Americans across all socio-economic levels.
According to the  <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> the first print occurrence of the word "iced cream" as in 1688. The term "ice cream" shows up in 1744. That corresponds approximately with the time when "modern" ice creams were first manufactured.

<b>European introduction & evolution</b><br>
"Ice cream is reputed to have been made in China as long ago as 3000 BC, but it did not arrive in
Europe (via Italy) until the thirteenth century, and Britain had to wait until the late seventeenth
century to enjoy it (hitherto, iced desserts had been only of the sorbet variety)... by the time
Hannah Glasse and Elizabeth Raffald were giving recipes for it in the mid-eighteenth century, it
was evidently well established. At first, ice cream was simply as its name suggests: cream, perhaps
sweetened, set in a pot nestling in ice to cool it down. But before long recipes became more
sophisticated, and the technique of periodic stirring to prevent the formation of ice crystals was
introduced, and ice cream was set on a career of unbroken popularity. As early as 1821 we find
mention of "ice-cream gardens' in New York....Since introducing ice cream to Europe in the
Middle Ages, Italy has never relinquished its lead in theis field, and over the centuries the
manufacture of ice cream has in many countries been the province of Italian emigres."<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford Univeristy Press:Oxford] 2002 (p.
167)
<p>
"The first ice creams, in the sense of an iced and flavoured confection made from full milk or
cream, are thought to have been made in Italy and then in France in the 17th century, and to have
been diffused from the French court to other European countries...The first recorded English use
of the term ice cream (also given as iced cream) was by Ashmore (1672), recording among dishes
served at the Feast of St. George at Windsor in May 1671  One Plate of Ice Cream'. The first
published English recipe was by Mrs. Mary Eales (1718)...Mrs. Eales was a pioneer with few
followers; ice cream recipes remained something of a rarity in English-language cookery
books...As for America, Stallings observes that  ice cream is recorded to have been served as
early as 1744 (by the lady of Governor Blandon of Maryland, nee Barbara Jannsen, daughter of
Lord Baltimore), but it does not appear to have been generally adopted until much later in the
century. Although its adoption then owed much to French contacts in the period following the
American Revolution, Americans shared 18th century England's tastes and the English preference
for ice creams over water ices, and proceeded enthusiastically to make ice cream a national
dish."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
392-3)
<p>
"The first substantial piece of writing on ice cream was an anonymous 84-page manuscript entitled <i>L'Art de faire des Glaces</i> which, through watermarks in the 
paper, has been dated "circa 1700." It is a "how to" work of some sophistication, giving detailed instructions for the preparation of such delights as apricot, 
voilet, rose, chocolate, and a caramel ice creams and water ices. A number of British cookbooks of the eighteenth century contain ice cream formulas. One such 
work is Mrs. Hannah Glasse's <i>The Art of Cookery Made Easy</i> (1747)--considered by scholars to be the first major cookbook written by a woman in what was 
until then an almost exclusively male domain. In 1768 there appeared in Paris what is undoubtedly the most outlandish treatise on the subject ever to be published. 
Called <i>The Art of Making Frozen Desserts</i>, it is a 240-page offering by one M. Emy, who not only gives formulas for "food fit for the gods," but offers theological 
and philosophical explanations for such phenomena as the freezing of water. The tone of the book is set by its frontispiece, which depicts a brace of angels 
delivering ice cream to earth from heaven. Although frozen desserts were becoming common in regal circles, not until 1670 when the Cafe Procope opened in Paris 
did "iced creams" and sherbets spread to the masses."<br>

<b>Ice cream myths & legends</b><br>
No other food boasts offers more legends of discovery than ice cream. This tribute to popular ubiquity merits
examination. Is it possible to separate fact from fiction? Sometimes. On the other hand, sometimes it's more interesting
to embrace myths in context rather than deconstruct for scientific purpose. The stories are as delectable as the 
product itself. What are they really telling us about our collective gastronomic legacy?
<p>
<b>Catherine de Medici & the "introduction" ice cream to France</b><br>
"How curious then, in modern times--meaning from the mid ninteenth century on--it has come to be believed that Catherine de
Medici was accompanied to France by a bevy of Italian confectioners who taught their French colleagues how to make ices and
frozen sherbets. Since the story is widely believed in Italy, appears indeed to be central to the credo of the Italian
ice-cream trade...it is necessary to say here that although the source of the story remains unidentified, it is plain that its
origins are in the nineteenth century, the likelihood being that it rose out of a lingistic confusion...connected in some way
perhaps with the stories of ice introduced into France during Henry III's reign--or shortly before it--and while Catherine herself
was still in a powerful position as Queen Mother and Regent. I do know that of two people who helped disseminate it in 
England one was Abraham Hayward, QC, author of <i>The Art of Dining</i>, published in 1852. In a footnote to his chapter on Paris
restaurants, <a href="foodicecream.html#haywardice">Hayward</a> remarked that it had been established that Catherine de Medici and her Florentine confectioners had brought
the art of making ices to the French capital. He gave no chapter or verse, but his footnote gives the impression that it was something
he recently read, whether in French or in English perhaps we shall one day find out. It would be agreeable to nail the legend to 
its origin. The second English writer, who did more than Haywood to establish the Medici story, was <a href="foodicecream.html#beetonice">
Mrs. Isabella Beeton</a>. Very 
probably she had read it in <i>The Art of Dining</i>. Among many startling statements in her famous <i>Household Management</i>
of 1861--'the Italians with the exception of macaroni, have no specially characteristic article of food' is a fair example--was
her suggestion that in the light of Catherine's great innovation in the matter of ice-creams she might be forgiven the massacre
of St. Bartholomew."<br>
---<i>Harvest of the Cold Months: The Social History of Ice and Ices</i>, Elizabeth David [Viking:New York] 1994 (p. 44-45)
<br>
[Note: David also investigates legend regarding Procope's opening the first ice cream parlor in Paris.]
<p>
<a name="haywardice"><b>Mr. Hayward's quote:</b> "We are unable to fix the precise time when [ices/ice cream]
there began to be cultivated with success, but it met with the most enlightened encouragement from the merchant-princes of 
Florence, and the French received the first rudiments of the science from the professors who accompanied Catherine de Medicis to
Paris...*It is clearly established that they introduced the use of ices into 
France. Fricandeaus were invented by the chef of Leo X. Coryat, in his 'Crudities Gobbled Up,' writing in the reign of James 1.,
says that he was called 'Furcifer' by his friends, from his using their 'Italian neatnesses namely forks.'"<br>---

<b>First ice cream recipe published in America?</b><br>
According to the venerable food historian Karen Hess, the first ice cream recipe published in the United States appeared in <i>The New
Art of Cookery, According to the Present Practice</i>/Richard Briggs, circa <a href="foodicecream.html#icecream1792">1792</a>. This recipe is almost exactly the same as Mrs. Raffald's (see below). Ms. Hess
observes: "the first American recipe that I know of that features vanilla on its own is one for vanilla ice cream in Mary Randolph's <i>The Virginia Housewife</i>, 1824; similar
recipes had, however been appearing in France, and Jefferson brought back one in 1784, showing once again how tht printed word lags behind usage." Source:

<p>
Our survey of 18th-early 19th century English and American cookbooks confirms fruit ice creams were probably the most popular. Most cookbooks of the day contained several recipes for
 flavored creams, including one recipe especially for ice cream. In theory, any sweet cream recipe could be processed to become ice cream. Most period 
cookbooks note that any type of fruit may be used. 
<p>
<b>Which flavors were available in the 18th century?</b><br>
People have been adding flavors to ice/ice cream right from the beginning! Ice cream began as
granita (ice). This product was often flavored with fruit or honey. In the 18th century
when the first ice creams (as we know them today) were produced, they were likewise flavored. Period recipes are excellent
indicators of popular flavorings:
<a name="oldrecipes">
<blockquote>
<b>[1747]<br>
"To make ice cream.</b> Take two pewter basons, one larger than the other; the inward one must
have a close cover, into which you are to put your cream, and mix it with raspberries, or whatver
you like best, to give it a flavour and a colour. Sweeten it to your palate; then cover it close, and
set it into the larger bason. Fill it with ice, and a handful of salt: let it stand in this ice three
quarters of an hour, then uncover it, and stir the cream well together: cover it close again, and let
is stand half an hour longer, after that turn it into your plate. These things are made at the
pewterers."<br>
---<i>The Art of Cookery Made Plain & Easy</i>, Hannah Glasse, facsimile of the first edition,
1747 [Prospect Books:Devon] 1995 (p. 168)
<p>
<b>[1769]<br>
"To make Ice Cream.</b> Pare, stone, and scald twelve ripe apricots, beat them in a fine marble mortar. Put to them six ounces of double-refined sugar, a pint of 
scalding cream, work it through a hair sieve. Put it into a tin that has a close cover, when you see your cream grow thick round the edges of your tin, stir it, and set 
it again till all grows quite thick. When your cream is to be turned out of, then put on the lid. Have ready another tub with ice and salt in as before, put your mould in
 the middle and lay your ice under and over it, let it stand four or five hours. Dip your tin in warm water when you turn it out. If it be summer you must not turn it out
 til the moment you want it. You may use any sort of fruit if you nave not apricots, only observe to work it fine."<br>
---<i>The Experienced English Housekeeper</i>, Elizabeth Raffald, facsimile 1769 edition with an introduction by Roy Shipperbottom [Southover Press:East 
Sussex] 1997 (p. 126) [NOTE: Mrs. Raffald's other fruit cream (non-ice) recipes employ lemon, raspberry, and orange. She also offers recipes for pistachio and
 chocolate cream.]

Ice Creams</b>. Take a dozen ripe apricots, pare them very thin and stone them, scald and put them into a mortar, and beat them fine; put to them six ounces of

and the ice cream, put on the top lid, and have another tub of ice ready, as before, put the mould in the middle, with the ice under and over it; let it stand four hours, and
do not turn it out before you want it; then dip the mould into cold spring water, take off the lids and paper, and turn it into a plate. You may do any sort of fruit the same way."<br.

<p>
<b>[1824]<br>
Ice Creams</b>. When ice creams are not put into shapes, they should always be served in glasses with handles. 
<br><b>Vanilla Cream.</b> Boil a vanilla bean in a quart of rich milk until it has imparted the flavour sufficently; then take it out, and mix with the milk, eight eggs, yelks
and whites, beaten well; let it boil a little longer--make it very sweet, for much of the sugar is lost in the operation of freezing."
<br><b>Raspberry Cream.</b> Make a quart of rich boiled custard; when cold, pour it on a quart or ripe red raspberries, mash them tin it, pass it through a sieve, sweeten
and freeze it."<br>
<b>Peach Cream.</b> Get fine soft peaches, perfectly ripe, peel them, take out the stones, and put them in a China bowl; sprinkle some sugar on and chop them very
small, with a silver spoon; if the peaches be sufficiently ripe, they will become a smooth pulp; add as much cream or rich milk as you have peaches; put more sugar and 
freeze it."<br>
<b>Citron Cream.</b> Cut the finest citron melons, when perfectly ripe, take out the seeds and slice the nicest part into a China bowl, in smal pieces, that will lie
conveniently, cover them with powdered sugar, and let them stand several hours, then drain off the syrup they have made, and add as much cream as it will give a strong
flavour to, and freez it. Pine apples may be used in the same way."<br> 
<b>Observations on Ice Cream.</b> It is the practice with some indolent cooks, to set the freezer, containing the cream, in a tub wtih ice and salt, and put it in the ice-house;
it will certainly freeze there, but not until the watery particles have subsided, and by the separation destroyed the cream. A freezer should be twelve or fourteen
inches deep, and eight or ten wide. This facilitates the operation very much, by giving a larger surface for the ice to form, which it always does on the sides of the vessel; a 
silver spoon, with a long handle, should be provided for scraping the ice from the sides, as soon as formed, and when the whole is congealed, pack it in moulds (which must be 
placed with care, lest they should not be upright,) in ice and salt till sufficiently hard to retain the shape--they should not be turned out till the moment they are to be
served. The freezing tub must be wide enough to leave a margin of four or five inches all around the freezer when placed in the middle, which must be filled up with
small lumps of ice mixed with salt--a larger tub would waste the ice. The freezer must be kept constantly in motion during the process, and ought to be made of 
pewter, which is less liable than tin to be worn in holes and spoil the cream by admitting the salt water."<br>

<b>First chocolate ice cream?</b><br>
Our research confirms chocolate ice cream existed in the 18th century. But? It was the exception, not the rule. 
Most period <a href="foodicecream.html#americanicecream">iced creams</a> were flavored with fruit.
We do not find  chocolate ice creams in popular domestic English period cookbooks. Mrs. Raffald's 1769 recipe for 
chocolate cream is not frozen. Earliest print refernce is from a French cookbook, c. 1768.
<p>
"...any collected manuscript from the last quarter of the seventeenth century will surely have recipes involving 
chocolate; chocolate 
became the rage among ladies and those who would be." <br>
---<i>Martha Washington's Booke of Cookery</i>, transcribed by Karen Hess [Columbia University Press:New York] 1981, 1995 (p. 451) 
<p>
"Chocolate, coffee, and tea were the three important new beverages in seventeenth-century Europe, and they were all used to make 
unfrozen creams. Menon made creams with all three...But these creams were all creams, not ice creams. It took some time before 
all thee of the new beverages were transformed into frozen creams and ices. Emy made chocolate and coffee ice creams and mousses and chocolate 
ices...He introduced his recipe 'Glace de Creme au Cacao' by explaining that cacao was the nut with which one makes chocolate. He 
described four types, with different shapes and degrees of bitterness and fattiness, and said all could be used to make ice 
cream. aid it was necessary to understand how to distinguish among them, and that it was important to choose large heavy ones with 
no green or raw taste or mold. One bought cacao at a spice shop or from chocolate makers, either roasted or not, according to Emy. Naturally, 
he included detailed instructions for roasting it. His recipe 'Glace de Creme au Cacao' was more complex than his usual cremes 
glaces. It was also unusual in its use of egg whites rather than yolks. He started by making a glace royale, which is an icing 
sugar made with stiffly beaten egg whites and sugar...Emy mixed cream into it and cooked it slowly, stirring it carefully until 
it thickened. Then he added two more ounces of roasted cacao and cooked the mixture in a bain marie, or warm water bath, until 
the flavor of the chocolate permeated the cream. After an hour and a half to two hours, he strained the mixture, then chilled 
it and froze it. He suggested adding a little ambergris, cinnamon, or vanilla, and he said he didn't think it was possible to make 
a better ice cream of its type. Emy also made what he called a glace de creme au chocolate blanc, but it was not made with 
white chocolate. He said it was made the same way as his glace de creme au cacao, except that, before putting the cream on the fire, 
he added half grain of ambergis, half a vanilla bean, and two grains of cinnamon. He said it would be 'delicious' (his 
italics). His recipe for chocolate ice, 'Glace de Chocolate L'Eau,' was less complicated. He simply melted some bon chocolate de 
sante, or 'good chocolate of health,' mixed it with sugar syrup cooked to the petit lisse stage, strained it, and froze it. 
He said if one wished, one could use chocolate a vanille and add vanilla, clove, and lemon." <br>

Several people over the years have queried us with regards to the illusive Augustus Jackson, "Philadephia inventor of ice

confectionery store. Cold custards, which were cooled after being made by setting them on a cake of ice, were very fashionable, and Jackson conceived the idea 
of freezing them, which he did by placing the ingredients in a tin bucket and completely covered with ice. Each bucket contained a quart, and was sold for $1.
 It immediately became popular, and the inventor soon enlarged his store, and when he died left a considerable fortune A good many tried to follow his example, 
and ice cream was hawked about the streets, being wheeled along very much as the hokey-pokey carts are now, but none of them succeeded in obtaining the flavor 
that Jackson had in his product.--Baker's Helper."<br>---<i>New York Times</i>, March 11, 1894 (p. 18) <br>[NOTE: this information was reprinted verbatim  in the <i>Grand Union Cook Book</i>,  Margaret Compton [Grand Union Tea Co.:New York] 1902 (p. 291)

"Augustus Jackson, a Philadelphia Negro, was the first to make America's favorite frozen confection--ice cream--according to the records in the possession of 
citizens living in the City of Brotherly Love. In 1832 there were five Negro confectioners in Philadelphia. One of them was Jackson, know in his day and time as
 'the man who invented ice cream.' He also was a caterer. For an extended period he enjoyed a monopoly of the sale of this dessert. He demanded $1 a quart,
 and had no difficulty selling all he made...The Jackson establishment was in what was then known as Goodwater Street, now St. James, between Seventh and
 Eight streets. After his death his daughter continued the business for several years on Walnut street, near Tenth street. Members of the Jackson family, with their
 limited facilities, were unable to meet the public demand for ice cream, and other confectioners and caterers, principally Negroes, began making it to their financial 
advantage."<br>---"Philly Citizen Was First Maker of Ice Cream," Lester A. Walton, <i>The Pittsburgh Courier</i>, May 19, 1928 (p. 12)

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Howard Johnson's 28 flavors</b></font><br>
New England restauranteur Howard Deering Johnson built an orange-roofed empire with the slogan "28 flavors." His black 
Cadillac sported Massachusetts license plate HJ-28. It should be easy to obtain this famous list, yes? Not!!!
<p>
The rise and fall of Howard Johnson's restaurant empire is well documented. The list of his ice cream flavors melts through
historic cracks. Why 28? The Howard Johnson article in the <i>Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America</i> 
 suggests to us it might have commemorated the year 1928, when Johnson's success became apparent. His first restaurant opened 
the following year. This source notes "the original flavors, vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry, gradually increased to 28." (2004: Vol. 1, p. 691)
<p>
Our survey of historic newspapers revealed Johnson's brilliant marketing strategy. As with most ice cream chains
touting a specific number of flavors, there was in truth dozens, if not hundreds, more. Johnson's ice cream was
manufactured in his own factories; flavors were dispersed according to season and region. That explains why we don't see
a specific ice cream list on printed restaurant menus.

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>First American ice cream parlor?</b></font><br>

Who opened the first American ice cream parlor, where, and when? Excellent questions with no single answer. Our research uncovers two "claimants" to the title of 
first commercial American establishment selling ice cream. They were both located in 1770s downtown New York City. The person most often credited is Philip 
Lenzi, who established his store (probably) in 1774. Advertisments published in local period newspapers document his existence. Lenzi sold ice cream to his customers,
along with other popular sweets of the day. The other person is Giovanni Bosio,  supposedly establishing a "gelateria" in 1770. To date, we find no historic/academic 
evidence supporting this claim. If you can help, please let us know. In both cases, the name of the shop (confectionery shop, ice cream parlor, gelateria) is not mentioned. 
<p>
<b>Philip Lenzi, London confectioner</b><br>
Ice cream historians credit advertisements published by Philip Lenzi, a confectioner from London, as the first print evidence of commercial ice cream sales in America. Our survey of 
primary documents confirm the advertisements (see text below). Mr. Lenzi arrived in New York City in 1773, presumably his shop opened the following year. We know from the 
introductory advertisement announcing Mr. Lenzi's arrival that he made ice cream. The first true "advertisement" of said product appeared in <i>New New York Gazette and Weekly 
Mercury</i>, May 12, 1777. We have no way to determine exactly when the product was first available for sale. Mr. Lenzi's advertisement does not reference the name of his shop. This was
 typical of the times. Most 18th century specialty shops were simply known by their proprietor's name and trade: Philip Lenzi, confectioner. 
<p>
"The first appearance of ice cream in America is not known, but the first report of any sort indicating its presence in the colonies is a letter, written by a guest of 
Governor William Bladen of Maryland, which states: '...we had dessert no less Curious; among the Rarities of which it was Comnpos'd was somefine Ice Cream 
which, with the Strawberries and Milk, eat most Deliciously.' So far as is known, the first public advertisement of ice cream anywhere in the world was paid for by 
Philip Lenzi, a confectioner, who announced in the New York Gazette of May 12, 1777, that his ice cream 'may be had almost every day.' It can be assumed that
 ice cream was gaining a toehold in New York during the 1780s, because other ads began appearing in the New York papers. In 1781 a Lenzi competitor named 
Joseph Corre was the first to advertise the words Ice Cream in large conspicuous letters, and an announcement in the New York Post Boy (1786) read: 'Ladies 
and Gentlemen may be supplied with ice cream every day at City Tavern by their humble servant Joseph Crowe."<br>

<b>Giovanni Bosio, Italian Gelateria</b><br>
A handful of contemporary sources credit Giovanni Bosio, an Italian ice cream maker, for opening the first ice cream parlor (aka gelateria) in New York City, 
1770. Some state Bosio came from Genoa; others Sicily. Our survey of historic newspapers, academic journals, ice cream 
history books, and trade association texts returns no mention of Bosio. This, in itself. does not automatically discount 
the claim. We will continue our search for documentation. The earliest print reference we find is from 1988. No original/

<a name="shrinkage">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>When did 1/2 gallon ice cream containers begin disappearing?</b></font><br>
2002. In that year, ice cream packaging began 'slenderizing' with a new round shape containing 1 cup less product. Companies cited rising ingredient/production 
costs. Questioning consumers were assured the new packages eliminated dreaded "knuckle-muck." 
<p>
"The half-gallon ice cream container - the sweet standard of grocery store freezers for decades - is quietly starting to shrink. 
While manufacturers over the years reduced the package size of everything from candy bars to dish detergent, the traditional ice cream "brick" remained what it was - the half-gallon. 
Now, pinched by rising costs of ingredients and afraid to raise prices already above $5, at least two ice cream makers are silently phasing out the half-gallon and replacing it with a 1.75-quart carton, a half-pint smaller. Others are considering doing the same. 
Dreyer's, which is based in Oakland, Calif., and sells the Dreyer's and Edy's brands, began introducing the smaller package in March. During the transition, the new and old cartons can be found side-by-side. Same shape and design - and price. But one has two quarts, the other 1 3/4 quarts. 
Asked about the move, Dreyer's cites a $30 million jump last year in the cost of butter fat and other ingredients. Dreyers is one of the biggest manufacturers, with annual sales of $1.4 billion. 
"We have over 100 flavors and many of them - because people are preferring indulgent, chunky flavors - cost more to produce than regular flavors like vanilla," said spokeswoman Dori Bailey. 
"We'd like to keep the cost at a price that's more affordable for folks," she said. 
Schwan's, which sells retail primarily via a 7,000-vehicle fleet of home delivery trucks, made the switch in late 2001. 
"When costs trend up, you have a choice to make: Do you raise the unit price or do you reduce the unit?" said John Nabholz, spokesman for Schwan's Sales Enterprises, based in Marshall, Minn. "You can't lose money on a product and stay in business." 
Other major ice cream makers are sticking with the half gallon for now. About three quarters of all ice cream is sold by the half gallon, according to the International Ice Cream Association. 
Good Humor-Breyer's, which boosted its half-gallon price by 30 cents in mid-2001 because of rising costs, has no plans to shrink its packages. 
"If we can avoid passing it on to the consumer, that's what we'll do," said spokeswoman Lisa Piasecki. "So far, we have." 
Turkey Hill dairy, in Lancaster, Pa., has no plans to switch from half gallons but introduced the idea to a pair of focus groups last week, to gauge consumer reaction, according to spokeswoman Melissa Mattilio. 
Using the 1.75-quart and half-gallon Edy's containers as examples, Turkey Hill market researchers asked them how they felt about such shrinkage. 
"We just asked if anyone was aware that this had happened," Mattilio said. "No one had noticed at all. When it was pointed out to them, they said, 'That doesn't seem too right, but what are we really going to do about it?"' 
Customers do notice change, and some don't appreciate it. 
"Everybody's doing it," complained Dorothy McGrath, 73, of Linwood, N.J., as she shopped the ice cream aisle at a Super Fresh supermarket in Egg Harbor Township recently. "The same thing happened with laundry detergent. The brands I used to buy in 100-ounce bottles are now 80 ounces, only the price is the same. They're cheating the public, because they don't advertise it." 
McGrath bought two half gallons of Turkey Hill brand ice cream, which were $1.99 on sale. The only brands offered in the 1.75-quart sizes were Edy's and Healthy Choice. 
She gets so angry when product sizes shrink that she sometimes switches to a different brand in protest. 
That's a legitimate concern, according to ice cream industry consultant Malcolm Stogo. 
"The public does not like to see downsizing. They think they're being cheated. Putting a 1.75-quart container out instead of a half-gallon container is very deceptive," said Stogo, author of "How to Succeed in the Incredible Ice Cream Business." 
Manufacturers have heard such complaints, but sales haven't been significantly affected, they say. 
"We've had a few people say, 'Wait a minute, there's less ice cream in this package,"' said Nabholz, of Schwan's. "But our research shows there's effectively the same yield. It's a more user-friendly package and it's more efficient." 
The lidded containers eliminate the messy problem of half-gallon bricks that could be - and frequently were - opened at both ends, and reduce "knuckle muck," which is the ice cream that gets on your hands as you dig your spoon deep into the box, he said. 
The company's sales have remained strong, in part because ice cream is a luxury consumers are willing to pay for. 
"Most consumers view ice cream as a luxury purchase, a small indulgence, and are somewhat more price-elastic," said Eric 
Katzman, food analyst for Deutsche Bank."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>a la mode</b> (aka topped with ice cream)</font><br>
Food historians confirm the European practice of topping baked goods (most notably pie and cake) with rich cream (sauce, whipped) dates to Renaissance times.
Historic cookbooks offer several examples; none of which are titled "a la mode." Back in the day, "a la mode" generally pertained to a popular way of preparing beef.
While the phrase is French, we find no supporting print evidence the combination of ice cream topped dessert originated in that country. Barry Popik, 
etymolotgist extrodinaire, traces the phrase to the <a href="http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/remember_the_a_la_mode_pie_a_la_mode/">
late 1890s</a>. Our survey of historic American newspapers confirms the phrase became popular in the early 20th century. 
<p>

"In French cuisine, a la mode (literally 'in the fashion') refers to a dish of beef braised with vegetables and served either hot in a rich brown sauce or cold in aspic. It
 has some currency in English in the eighteenth century and nineteeth centuries in the compressed form alamode beef. In the USA, however, a la mode denotes a
 dish (such as apple pie) served with ice cream."<br>

"Major league ball players as a class, race, or division of society, whichever they might be called are about as free from the ordinary weaknesses of the flesh as any 
body of men in the world. Wine, women and song trouble them very little in the playing season, and even their gambling is of that mild and friendly nature which 
makes it more of a pastime than a means of enriching one' self. But there is one great vice among the athletes; on from which comparatively few of them are free. 
Eating ice cream is this failing...The Tigers are particularly gripped by this gastronomic vice and on several occasions this spring they have cleaned the hotels that 
entertained them of every bit of ice cream sherbet, punch and frozen pudding...The big leaguers are great people to eat sweets...Pie runs next to ice cream in

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Baked Alaska</b></font><br>
Baked Alaska, frozen cream encased in meringue and served hot, descends from Renaissance era <a href="foodfaq1.html#englishtrifle">Trifles</a>, fanciful 
presentations of cream and sponge biscuits. 
Frozen versions were perfected in 18th-19th century Europe. Desserts approximating "Baked Alaska" surface
in the 19th century. The earliest iterations were <a href="foodicecream.html#friedicecream">fried or baked iced cream encased in pastry</a>. Baked Alaska (aka Omelete Norvegienne, Omelete en Surprise), surfaced in the late
19th century. It was an "improved" version of popular fried cream, fried ice cream, and fried ice. Why call it an omelette? Possibly because the ice cream was
encased in eggs (meringue)--or--some French dessert omelettes were "finished" in a hot oven.
<p>
<b>Who "invented" Baked Alaska?</b><br>
There are four competing stories; two American, two French. The key to discovering the truth is examining the original source for credibility and context. And? Whenever
possible, a identifying a description of the dish in question. There are significant differences between "invented," "introduced," and "made popular."
<p>
<b>1.</b> Americans love to credit <a href="foodicecream.html#1802friedicecream">Thomas Jefferson</a> for serving the first Baked Alaska in 1802. Primary accounts, 
published 70 years later, confirm he served a dessert composed warm ice cream in pastry shell. This precursor was not a "true" Baked Alaska, but it was similar in effect.
<p>
<b>2.</b> <a href="foodicecream.html#1894bakedalaska">Charles Ranhofer</a>, Delmonico's New York City, marking the occasion of Seward's Alaska purchase, 1867. Print evidence
strongly suggests this claim is true. It also makes sense in place and context. According to <i>The Oxford English Dictionary</i>, the first print reference to "Baked Alaska" occured in 1882. 
"5. orig. U.S. A dessert consisting of sponge cake and ice cream covered with meringue, cooked in a hot oven for a very short time so that the ice cream does not melt (usu. more fully baked Alaska). With distinguishing word: a specified variety of this. Also with lower-case initial.
The naming of this dessert is attributed to Delmonico's restaurant, New York, where it was designed to commemorate the Alaska Purchase; there are earlier examples of similar desserts consisting of ice cream baked in a pastry shell.
1882   G. A. Sala Amer. Revisited I. vi. 90,   I dined at Delmonico's hard by the Fifth Avenue Hotel... Among the dainties..was an entremet called an Alaska. The
 Alaska is a baked ice..surrounded by an envelope of carefully whipped cream which..is popped into the oven."
<i>Delmonico's: A Century of Splendor</i>/Lately Thomas reiterates: "...[Sala] was served a 'baked Alaska'--an incredible confection...consisting of ice cream in an envelope of whipped cream, the whole toasted in the
oven! (The dish had been invented by Ranhofer at the time of Secretary of State Seward's purchase of Alaska for the United States.)" (p. 191).
<p>
<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i> (1938, 1961) provides these theories:<br>
"It is said that the invention of the surprise omelette, called 'a la norgvegienne', is attributed to an American-born physicist called Benjamin Thompson whose work in 
England earned him the title of Count Benjamin Thompson Rumford. This omelette was launched into popularity about 1895, at the Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo, by Jean Giroux, who was then in charge of the kitchens there."
<i>LG</i> also offers this origin theory: "If...we are to believe the culinary column of the <i>Liberte</i>, in which Baron Brisse wrote on 6th June 1866, it was the master-cook of the 
Chinese Mission, visiting Paris at the time who, if not invented, at least popularised this paradoxical omelette, which combines the cold and hot...'During the stay of the Chinese Mission in
Paris, the master-cooks of the Celestial Empire have exchanged civilities and information with the chefs of the Grand Hotel. (The Grand-Hotel was opened in 1862 and its first chef was called
Balzac.) 'The French chef in charge of sweet courses is particularly delighted with this circumstance. He has learnt from his Chinese colleague the method of baking vanilla and 
ginger ices in the oven. Here is how to proceed with this delicate operation: Chill the ice until hard, wrap each in a very light pastry crust and put into the oven. The pastry is baked before the ice protected by the pastry shel can melt. This phenomenon is explained by poor 
conductability of certain substances."<br>

(aka Henri Babinski) was a respected scientist and culinary expert of his day. His work <a href="https://archive.org/details/gastronomieprat00aligoog"><i>Gastronomie Pratique</i></a>
 was introduced in 1907 and survived several editions through 1928. The first edition (the only one we find online, free) does not contain the Rumford note. We will
continue searching. We find no print evidence (so far) supporting Rumford's "claim" to having invented the prototype Baked Alaska, or any other dish. The 1895 monte
Carlo reference is sometimes misattributed Rumford. The original text confirms this note is not connected.

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Banana splits</b></font><br>
Two American towns claim the banana split as their own: Latrobe PA and Wilmington OH.
Which
one deserves the honor? You decide...
<p>
According to <i>The Food Chronology</i>, James Trager [Henry Holt:New York] 1995  "The
banana split was created [in 1904] by Latrobe, Pa., pharmacy apprentice David Strickler, 23, who
had returned from a visit to Atlantic City, where he was inspired by watching a soda jerk. He
placed three scoops of ice cream on a split banana, topped it with chocolate syrup, marshmallow,
nuts, whipped cream, and a cherry, sold it for a dime, and was soon imitated by other soda jerks,
who generally used three different ice cream flavors-chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla-topped
with chocolate, strawberry, and pineapple, nuts, whipped cream, a cherry, but no marshmallow.
Strickler eventually took of the pharmacy and continued making banana splits until he sold the
place in 1965." (page 380)
<p>
Food historians confirmvbananas were introduced to the American public in the 1880s. These exotic
fruits were actively promoted and quickly embraced. Late 19th and early 20th century American
cookbooks contain an interesting variety of banana recipes. Many of these simly added bananas
to extant recipes: banana ice cream, banana ambrosia, banana cake, etc. Antiques catalogs confirm

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Egg creams</b></font><br>

The general concensus of the food historians are with regards to egg creams, as Americans know
them today, are:<ol>
<li> Egg creams were invented at the beginning of the 20th century.
<li> They originated in New York City [Brooklyn].
<li> The have never contained eggs or cream.
</ol>
Debates regarding the exact genesis and "true recipe" of this confection are intense. The same
holds true for many beloved foods we eat today, esp. those born of the soda fountain era.
Culinary evidence confirms egg-based soda recipes with chocolate syrup did exist, under different
names. They descended from early <a
href="christmasfood.html#eggnog"> egg nog</a> recipes. <a
href="foodicecream.html#eggdrin">"Egg Drin"</a>, a popular early 20th century soda fountain concoction, is
strikingly similar to the classic egg cream.
<p>
"By 1891, there were more soda fountains than bars in New York according to <i>On the Town in
New York</i> by Michael and Ariane Batterberry. In the 1920s, the "egg cream," an eggless,
creamless libation was invented in a New York soda fountain...The annals of time have obscured
inventor and the rational and philosophical underpinnings of the drink's name."<br>
---<i>New York Cook Book</i>, Molly O'Neill [Workman Publishing:New York] 1992 (p. 197)
<p>
"Egg cream. A New York City soda-fountain confection made from chocolate syrup, milk, and
seltzer. The simplicity of the egg cream is deceptive, for its flavor and texture depend entirely on
the correct preparation. There is no egg in an egg cream, but if the ingredients are mixed properly,
a foamy, egg-white-like head tops the drink. Nevertheless, as David Shulman pointed out in
<i>American Speech</i> (1987), there was a confection, called an "egg cream" syrup listed in
W.A. Bonham's <i>Modern Guide for Soda Dispensers</i> (1896) that was made with both eggs
and cream, but no chocolate. This was probably not the egg cream that gained legendary fame in
eastern cities. Also, Lettice Bryan in <i>The Kentucky Housewife</i> (1839) gives a recipe for an
orange-flavored custard dessert called "egg cream."
     There seems no basis to believe the legend the Yiddish actor Boris Thomashefsky brought the
idea for the egg cream back from Paris after having tasted a drink called chocolate et creme.
Indeed the unchallenged claim for the invention of the egg cream is that Louis Auster, a Jewish
immigrant who came to the United States about 1890 and opened a candy store at Stanton and
Avenue D. According to Auster's grandson...the egg cream was a matter of happenstance. "My
[grandfather] was fooling around, and he started mixing water and cocoa and sugar and so on,
and somehow or other, eureka, he hit on something which seemed to be just perfect for him."
     Auster's egg creams became famous...and were based on a secret formula that has never been
revealed...The chocolate syrup used was made in the rear of the store, and windows were blacked
out for privacy. "The name of the egg cream was really a misnomer, " recalled Stanley Auster.
"People thought there was cream in it, and they would like to think there was egg in it becuase
egg meant something that was really good and expensive. There was never any egg, and there
never was any cream." Auster also insisted a glass, not a paper cup, and ice-cold milk were basic
to the success of a good egg cream. After Louis Auster died...the recipe passed to his family, with
the last batch of the secret syrup made up...around 1974. The first printed reference to the egg
cream was in 1950. Without accesss to Auster's syrup, other soda fountains and candy stores
made the drink with "Fox's u-bet Chocolate Flavor Syrup," Created by Herman Fox some time
before 1920 in Brooklyn, now considered the most widely accepted ingredient in the mix."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New
York] 1999 (p. 120)
<p>
"Fox's U-Bet Chocolate Syrup is a classic. You absolutely cannot make an egg cream without
[it]...The firm, founded sometime between 1910 and 1920...began in a Brownsville
basement...The recipe for U-Bet remains the same: Brooklyn water, sugar, corn sweeteners,
cocoa, and some "secret things." The name "U-Bet dates from the late  20s when Fox's
grandfather got wildcatting fever and headed to Texas to drill for oil. "You bet" was a friendly
term the oilmen used. His oil venture a failure, he returend to the old firm, changing Fox's
Chocolate Syrup to Fox's U-Bet...Fox has fan letters form Mel Brooks, Don Rickles...You
shouldn't have to ask, but there is no egg or cream in an egg cream. Just milk, seltzer, and
U-Bet."<br>

<b>"How to Make an Egg Drin.</b><br>
First break  the egg in a 10-ounce soda glass, then pour in the desired syrup or syrups and add
sweet
cream if required, then beat the ingredients in the electric mixer thoroughly. Now pour this into a
shaker,
then turn in fine soda stream, then pour bakc and forth from your shaker to your glass two or
three times. In
pouring back and forth, do not overdo it as it will thin the drink. Pour into glass after mixing and
sprinkle a
little ground mace or nutmeg over the top. Most fountains now have the electric mixers but if you
do not
have one, you should use a heavy soda or mixing glass instead of the 10-ounce glass, then after
adding
cream, add a little crushed ice which will break the egg. Place shaker on top of glass and shake up
and
down until thoroughly mixed, then remove heavy soda glass and fill shaker with fine soda stream,
then mix
by pouring back and forth from a 10-ounce soda glass to shaker. Pour last in the glass and
sprinkle top with
ground mace or nutmeg. Egg drinks are profitable and a large trade on them can be created if care
is
exercised in their mixture. The following formulas are for the most common egg drinks: Egg
Chocolate:
One egg, 2 ounces chocolate syrups and 2 ounces sweet cream. Proceed as per directions

French-style ice creams descended from medieval custards and creams. Freezing them
was an idea made possible by advances in technology. A survey of old French,
English, and American cookbooks confirms this recipe was well known, although it was
known by many different names.
<p>
"About 1700 a pamphlet of ice-cream and sherbet recipes was published entitled L'Art
de Faire des Glaces, and by then the major capitals of Europe were well familiar with
the dish...Thomas Jefferson, who wrote extensive notes on making the confection, has
been credited with bringing "French-style" ice cream, made with egg yolks, to America.
He also had an ice-cream-making machine he called a "sorbetiere" at Monticello, where
he followed a recipe that called for a stick of vanilla...two bottles of cream, and an egg-custard
mixture, boiled, stirred, reheated, strained, and put in an  ice pail'."<br>

"Cream a la Vanille.<br>
Take one or two sticks of vanilla, which infuse in some boiling cream; next put in the
eggs as you do for other creams. If you are making a fromage a la glace, you must put
a smaller quantity of eggs, as isinglass is to be put to stiffen it; and keep constantly
stirring the cream on the fire, while the eggs are doing. Mind that the eggs are not
overdone. When you perceive the cream is getting thick, put the melted isinglass in,
and rub it through a tammy, then put it into a mould and into ice. When you wish to
make the cream more delicate, let it get cold; then put it into a vessel over ice, before
you put any isinglass into it, and whip it; when quite frozen, put in cold melted isinglass:
this method requires less isinglass, and the jelly is much lighter."<br>

Gourmets who visit San Francisco enthuse about this dessert, which is to be found at a few of the
best hotels and restaurants. It's not often served at home, apparently because most cooks don't
dare risk it, but it's really very simple to make. It turns up in a San Diego cook book, under then
name of "Bonfire Entre." It was called that because the fried cream was cut in sticklike pieces and
stacked up on individual plates like miniature and roofless log cabins. A couple of lumps of sugar,
brandy-soaked, went into the center of each pile of "logs," and matches graced the side of each
plate. The lights were lowered, and everyone lit up. Whoopee!<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Gelato</b></font><br>
The story of gelato begins hundreds of years ago. About 
  <a href="foodicecream.html#icecream">ice cream</a>.
<p>
  
  "Gelato. Ice cream, made with egg custard, sugar, and flavorings. From the latin gelare
  (to freeze). The Arabs were the first to develop the kind of fruit ice that the Italians called
  sorbetto, but the Chinese seem to have invented milk-based ice cream, which Marco Polo
  described on his returned from the Orient. The idea for both frozen desserts were brought
  to France by a cook named Bernardo Buontalenti, either with Caterina de'Medici in 1533
  or with Maria de'Medici in 1600. It was, however, a Sicilian who made custard-based ice
  cream, a wildly popular and fashionable confection: Francesco Procopio dei Coletti, an
  impovershed Palermo aristocrat, emigrated to Vienna in 1672, first to work for a coffee
  purveyor, then as owner of his own coffeehouse. Before long he ran a chain of such cafes
  throughout Central Europe, then took the idea to Paris in 1675, where he opened the Cafe
  Procope...where he began selling Viennese-style ices and, before long, custard-rich ice
  creams. Coffee houses in Italy followed the Paris model, and gelato became hugely
  popular. In Italy today, the best ice creams in Italy are made by local gelaterie..."<br>
  ---<i>The Dictionary of Italian Food and Drink</i>, John Mariani [Broadway Books:New York]
  1998 (p. 115-6)
<p>
"Ice cream is not really the proper translation for gelato, since unlike American ice cream Sicilian gelato is not made with 
cream at all, but with crema rinforzata, which is nothing other than the omnipresent biancomangiare in a particularly liquid
form. One old recipe calls for goat's milk...Modern Sicilian ice-cream parlors have abandoned goat's milk."<br>

[NOTE: includes modernized recipe.]
<p>
"For centuries, Italian ices and ice ream have been a summer treat on their home ground and indeed in all of Europe, but during the
last 30 years or so gelato (Italian ice cream) has also become a fixture, at least in Rome, in winter as well. It's not just vanilla
and chocolate ice cream either. Artichoke, mango, whisky, rhubarb and other exotic flavors are today on the broadening palette
of the ice cream parlors. Their frequent sign 'Produzione Propria' means that gelat artists are at work, using their 
secret recipes...Gelato seems to taste better than homogenized or standard American ice cream because it isn't as deeply frozen
and therefore has a creamier texture, and because it usually contains plenty of fresh eggs and cream...In Rome, the most renowed
ice cream emporium is Giolitti's...The history of Giolitti's is a good example of the recent fortunes of gelato. More than 
50 years ago the grandfather of the rpesent owner started out at the same spt with a dairy shop that became famouse for its
excellent cappuccino. Gelato was then just a minor summer sideline...Gelato...may have originated in Florence; one Bernardo
Nuontalenti is mentioned by chroniclers as its presumed inventor...During the Napoleonic era Tortoni's Cafe Napolitain, an opulent
gelato haven on the Boulevard des Italiens, was such a rage in Paris that the name Tortoni for some time  was synonymous with 
Italian ices."<br>
---"Cold Comfort in Rome," Paul Hoffmann, <I>New York Times</i>, April 10. 1983 (p. XX6)

<p>
"Italian gelatos differ from French ice creams in having a more powerful flavor and denser texture, thanks to the inclusion of more
solids and less air. Although they're usually made with milk instead of cream, they often contain more eggs than French ice creams
and thus taste equally rich, if not richer. Technically speaking, gelato is any kind of freeze served at an Italian ice cream
shop, or gelateria, including gelato itself as well as granita...sorbetto...and a very light-textured ice cream, semifreddo, made with
whipped cream or beaten egg whites...The best known gelato flavors are vanilla, a very rich vanilla called crema, and chocolate, often 
combined with hazelnuts (gianduia). Liqueur flavors are also popular, and so is espresso coffee."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Heavenly hash</b></font><br>
What is Heavenly Hash? Excellent question with five possible answers: fresh fruit salad, mixed fruit cocktail, "glorified"
ambrosia, ice cream and candy. Recipes generally combine fruit (fresh or candied), chopped nuts, and cream (whipping cream,
marshmallows). Heavenly Hash can be served cool, chilled, or iced. It can appear at the beginning or the end of the meal.
<p>
<b>Why call it heavenly hash?</b><br>
The term "Heavenly Hash," in a culinary sense,
first surfaces in American print in the last quarter of the 19th century. This coincides with the introduction of 
<a href="foodfaq.html#ambrosia">Ambrosia</a>, "Food of the Gods," a popular mixed fruit salad 
similar in scope and purpose. Possibly the names played off each other in friendly competition? 
A careful examination of primary sources
also confirms similar recipes can be found with different titles.
<p>
Our survey of historic American newspapers and cookbooks suggests Heavenly Hash recipes proliferated in the until the 1940s.
They were generally ignored until the 1980s, when Heavenly Hash was rediscovered by upscale ice cream manufacturers. 
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>[1887] </b><br>
St. Louis Republican: Havent you heard of heavenly hash? asked a pretty little matron down at the cooing schoolWhy, heavenly hash is just too delicious, and the name suits it to a dot. This is what it seems to be, and I believe it is; Oranges, bananas, lemons, apples, raisins, and pineapples are cut up into little bitshashed, you know, and worked just enough to thicken their juices, almost to jelly, and then served with a little grated nutmeg. But the serving is the pretty part. It is after this wise: Cut a hole just large enough to admit a spoon in the stem end of an orange, and through that hole take out the inside of the orange, which you then fill with the heavenly hash and served on a pretty little glass fruit-dish with lemon or orange leaves decorating the dish. You can imagine this heavenly hash to be a delightful new dainty, which at some recent luncheon parties has taken the pale of ice cream.

<a name="hokeypokey">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Hokey pokey</b></font><br>
Food historians generally agree the origin of the term "hokey pokey," as it relates to food, is traced
to Italian street vendors who sold inexpensive goods in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 
"Hokey pokey" is an English interpretation of the Italian phrase "O che poco," meaning how Oh,
how little." This "little" in this phrase related to price, as these street goods (ice cream treats of all
kinds in America/England, toffee flavored ice cream treats in New Zealand) were tasty and cheap.
As such, they held great appeal to children and working class people. 
<p>
Hokey pokey treats were generally sold in cities, amusement parks, boardwalks
and and resort areas via portable vehicles. These
ranged from hand-pushed carts to goat-pulled mini-wagons to bicycle-propelled carts to
horsedrawn/electric trucks. Folks who make a living selling icy treats from carts were known as
"hokey pokey" men.
<p>
The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> traces the term "hokey-pokey" in print, as it relates to ice
cream, to 1884. They oldest mention it cites for a toffee-like sweet (as it is known in New Zealand) is 1939:
Katherine Mansfield Scrapbook 3 "We always gave him the same presents...three cakes of
hoky-poky." Of course, spoken words often predate their printed cousins by several years.
<p>
"Hokey-pokey<br>
In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries hokey-pokey was a British English term for a
cheap sort of ice cream sold by street vendors ("Three hokey-pokey ice-cream hand-carts, one
after another, turned the corner of 'Trafalgar Road,' Arnold Bennett, Clayhanger, 1910). It
presumably came from the cry with which the vendors hawked it, although what this originally
was is not known (one suggestion put forward in the 1880s was Italian O che poco! 'Oh how
little!'--a reference to price, presumably, rather than quantity--which is given some plausibility by
the fact that many ice-cream sellers at that time were Italian). Nowadays the word is used in New
Zealand for a sort of crunchy toffee bar, and also for ice cream containing little pieces of such
toffee."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 160)
<p>
"[In the USA] Clearly there was a bias against the Italian vendors...The scorn that shop owners, wholesale ice cream makers, and others heaped on
street vendors often had more to do with the prejudice and fear of competition...Hokeypokey was a derogatory term used to describe
a type of ice cream the peddlers sold, as well as the vendors themselves...Confectioners were always contemptuous of street
peddlers..."<br>
---<i>Of Sugar and Snow: A History of Ice Cream Making</i>, Jeri Quinzio [University of California Press:Berkeley] 2009 (p. 111)<br>
[NOTE: Ms. Quinzio offers an entire chapter on this topic; your local public librarian can help you get a copy of the book.]
<p>
<b>What exactly was Hokey Pokey?</b><br>
"Hokeypokeys were slices cut from bricks of ice cream...These bricks were generally about eighteen inches long, twelve inches
wide, and two and a half to three inches deep. The flaovrs were arranged lenghthwise in a mold with tin dividers, which were removed once the 
ice cream was packed into the mold. They were usually layered with three different flavors of ice cream, and each crosswise slice would
reveal all three..,.they cost one or two pennies, and...children would buy half a slice for half the price...The wrapped splices
were sold to ice cream vendors. Whole bricks were sold to ice cream shops to be sliced and served, and also to householders, who had to 
rush home to serve them to their families before the ice cream melted."<br>

<b>Hokey Pokey recipes</b><br>
Below please find three recipes from a professional text. These formulas explain why this product could be sold so cheaply.
 Packaging notes are offered in the last recipe. Most curious? There is no "original" or recommended flavors. In line with
cheap production, flavorings depended upon whatever the maker had on hand (or wanted to use up?).
<blockquote>
<b>"Hokey Pokey</b><br>
Make a custard composed of 3 eggs, 1 quart of milk, 2 tablespoonfuls of corn starch, 6 ounces of pulverized sugar and sufficient of any 
desirable extract to flavor it. Bring the milk to the boil; mix the corn starch, 6 ounces of pulverized sugar and eggs; beat these smmothly together with a little cold
milk and add it to the boiling milk; stir all till the mixture begins to thicken, then add and stir in the flavor. Now immediately remove
it form the fire, and when it becomes cool stir it totether and our it into your freezer and freeze till solid."
<p>
<b>"Hokey Pokey</b><br>
Dissolve three ounces of corn starch in one quart of milk, also soak two ounces of gelatin in the little milk or water. Palce three quarts of 
mlk and one pound twelve ounces of sugar in a tin or porcelain-lined pan, set on the fire until boiling, then pour it over the
dissolved starch and gelatin, set on the fire again and bring to a good boil, stirring constantly with the egg beater, then add one can of 
condensed milk, strain, cool and freeze. Flavor at will. Another formula calls for six quarts of milk, one pound and
twelve ounces of sugar and half a pound of corn starch. Dissolve the starch and one ounce of gelatin in one quart of milk.
The mix all together and stir on the fire till it boils; strain, cool, freeze and flavor. Too much boiling will tend to curdle. In

<b>Who was the original Hokey Pokey man?</b><br>
None of our ice cream history books mention his name. We stumbled across this tiny obituary published in the New York Times, circa
1907. We glean, though cannot confirm via US Patents, that Mr. Dunham created the commercial
process. It seems unlikely the first street vendor peddling lowly hokey pokey to poor children from a rickety cart would be worth 
noting by the <i>New
York Times</i>.

Dunham, an aged citizen and originator of the now widely 'hokey pokey,' or ice cream brick, died at his home here to-day of heart
disease. Dunham conceived the idea of selling ice cream in cake form for a penny and laid by in a snug fortune before imitators broke
into his trade. He lived, however, to see the business he invented become a great industry and took just pride in being styled 
'the original hokey pokey man.'"<br>

Historic cookbooks confirm cream-based drinks, both warm and cold, have long been associated with good 
health and healing. Colonial and early American cookbooks generally include cream-based beverage  
recipes with other foods recommended for invalids. In those days, milk (or cream) was combined with alcoholic beverages (ale, sack) and standard beverages (coffee, 
tea). <a href="foodbeverages.html#rootbeer">Root beer</a> (sarsaprilla, birch, ginger ale, etc.) descended from ale. This accounts for their perceived healthful 
attributes. Early Black Cow advertisements thread back to these old times, promoting their new drinks as "good for the children." In 1939, the children of 
Chicago's <a href="foodicecream.html#hullhouseblackcow">Hull House</a> were treated to Black Cows.

<b>What is a Black Cow?</b><br>
"Black cow. Any variety of ice-cream sodas made with scoop of vanilla ice cream. Usually the

refers to the mixture of dark soda with a white dairy item floating in it."<br>

<p>
<b>When did they first appear?</b><br>
Our survey of historic USA cook books, soda fountain manuals, and historic newspapers suggests "black cows" surfaced in the beginning of the 20th century. It is
unclear if they desended from traditioanl ice cream sodas or popped up on their own.
Alternative concoctions (Coca Cola floats) were also popular. These simple fizzy drinks were <a href="sodafountain.html">soda fountain</a> mainstays.
The fact that Black Cows could be made at home enhanced their popularity. Unlike ice cream sodas, they required no fancy syrups, mixers, special glasses or garnishes.
We also find references to "Black Cow" (root beer) flavored ice cream, soft drink, and alcoholic liqueur. Mary Rattley's 'Black Cow Sauce' (aka cucumber sauce) was served to 
President and Mrs. Hoover in the White House.

biscuits and other cakes. In 19th century American cookbooks, "ice cream cake" had several

Ice cream sandwiches, as we Americans know them today, fall into the category of "novelties."
According to the food historians, ice cream novelties were introduced in the late 19th/early 20th
century. These were the treats of the "common folk." Cheaply priced items hawked by street
vendors in cities, resorts & fairs. The origin of several popular period ice cream treats (ice cream
cones, ice cream sundaes, banana splits, popsicles) are readily claimed by several people and
places. Not so, the ice cream sandwich. The earliest print references we find for the product name is 1900.
Certainly, the product could have existed earlier under different names.

He made the sandwiches quickly in a tin mold, and was kept so busy that he could not make change, but insisted on feceiveing the actual price for each ice cream sandwich--1 cent."<br>

The inventor takes a graham wafer, deftly plasters it with ice cream, claps another wafer on top, and there is your ice 
cream sandwich. The cost is trifling, ranging from 1 to 3 cents, according to the size and thickness of the thing. But the

"There are ham sandwiches and salmon sandwiches and cheese sandwiches and several other kinds of sandwiches--a downtown restaurant 
advertises 30 varieties--by the latest is the ice cream sandwich. As a new fad the ice cream sandwich might have made thousands of dollars for 
its inventor had the novelty been launched by a well-known caterer. But, strangely enough the ice cream sandwich made its advent in an humbler
 Bowery pushcart and is sold for a penny, says the New York make and Express. The idea is worth of a better field, for the ice cream sandwich is
 not only a distinct novelty, but has merits of its own. It will be appreciated by the child who on eating ice cream for the first time wanted to 
have it warmed. While losing nothing of its flavor, the thin wafers which go to make up the sandwich help to modify the coolness of the ice cream, 
so that it can be eaten more readily. The ice cream sandwich as made on the Bowery is constructed in this wise: A thin milk biscuit is placed in a 
tin mold just large enough to receive it. Then the mold is filled with ice cream from a freezer and another wafer is placed on top. There is an 
arrangement for forcing the sandwich out of the mold when complete, and the whole process takes only a few seconds. The ice cream sandwich
 man is the envy of all other pushcart restaurateurs on the Bowery, as he has all the patrons he can attend to and the car is always surrounded 
by curious customers." <br>

Italian water ice (also known as granita and sorbetto) has a long and ancient history:
<p>
"The Greeks and Romans employed lumps of Etna's snow to chill their wine; the Arabs used it
instead to chill their sarbat. The Italian word sorbetto and the English sherbert come from these
sweet fruit syrups that the Arabs once drank diluted with ice water. The passage from sarbat and
water, chilled in a container of ice, to granita was only a question of time, perhaps the chance
invention of a housewife distracted by a passing vendor or a crying child. Sicilians always claim an
Arabic origin for their ices, although in her book on Middle Eastern food Claudia Roden cites
neither an Arabic name nor a Levantine history for the granita recipes she gives. In any case,
whether it was in Damascus or in Catania that the sarbat stayed too long on ice, Sicily is the home
of ices as far as the Western world is concerned, and Araby their inspiration. The flavors most
common to the western part of Sicily are those that by now are most famous elsewhere in Italy
and in America as well, lemon and coffee..."<br>

"For thousands of years people saved ice to satisfy their desire for cool drinks. The earliest
icehouses existed in Mesopotamia, beside the Euphrates River, about 4,000 years ago. The rich
used the ice in these puts to cool their wines. Alexander the Great dug pits and filled them with
snow so that his army could have cool wine in the summer. Roman emperors had ice brought
from the mountains, and the kings of Egypt had snow shipped to them from Lebanon...Easterners,
especially in the Turkish Empire, frequently consumed iced fruit drinks, and the people of Greece
sold snow in the markets of Athens from as early as the fifth century BC. Today's sherberts and
wine coolers likely originated with the wine-flavored ices consumed by early peoples, and today's
snow cones likely originated with the ices made long ago form real snow mixed with honey and
fruit."<br>

"Water ices seem to have come into being, in Europe, at about the same time in the second half of
the 17th century as ice cream. The same technique is used for both products...It has been
suggested that ices (whether water ices or ice cream) were made much earlier in China. This
seems not impossible, and would be difficult to disprove. However, the further idea that they were
introduced to Europe by Marco Polo, returning to Venice from China in the 13th century, is
unsupported and is best counted as a piece of culinary mythology...As for precedence in
Europe...no one can say whether true water ices were first prepared in Italy of France or Spain.
Whatever the point of origin, their use spread quickly between the more sophisticated cities of
Europe, although there is no sure evidence of then they first crossed the Channel to
London...Water ices may be served as a stand-alone refreshment, as a dessert, or as a means of
refreshing the palate about halfway through a meal of many courses...Italian sorbetto, and Spanish
sorbete, belong to the sherbet group. Antoher Italian term, granita, refers to a water ice with a

<a name="sherbet">
<font color="#003366"><b>Sherbet & sorbet</b></font><br>
Essentially, sherbet and sorbet are similar products. Recipes evolved through the years. In
England, the word sherbet also came to denote a powdered fizzy candy. In the USA the term
'sherbet' is commonly used for 'sorbet', except for in fine restaurants. In the mid-19th century,
formal dinner menus offered <a href="foodicecream.html#sorbetcourse">sorbet</a> in the middle of the meal. About the words: 
<p>
"English acquired the word sherbet via Turkish or Persian serbet from Arabic shabah, 'beverage,
drink', and at first (in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries) it was used, logically enough, for a
Middle Eastern drink--specifically a cooling drink made from water, fruit juice, and sugar or
honey, and often chilled with snow. Then in the nineteenth century and effervescent white powder
was devised, composed of bicarbonate of sida, tartaric acid, sugar, and various flavourings, with
which to make fizzy drinks that supposedly resembled the original Oriental sherbet. Children
quickly discovered that it was if anything nicer to eat the sherbet powder than to make drinks with
it, and so were born the sherbet dabs and sherbet fountains of yesteryear (the former was a
lollipop that could be dipped into a bag of sherbet, the latter a cylindrical packet of sherbet with ta
liquorice straw for sucking it up). Sherbet is closely related etymolocially to shrub (the dirnk),
sorbet (in American English sherbet is often used for 'sorbet'), and syrup." <br>

"Italians were the undisputed master in developing methods of chilling a freezing drinks...The
creation of sorbet resulted from experiments in chilling drinks, and it too became a matter of
myth. Supposedly, sorbet was also brought to France by Catherine de'Medici...There is no
documentary evidence to support this hypothesis, however and we cannot prove that the art of
sorbet making was already practiced in Italy in the middle of the sixteenth century...Latini's...
<i>Treatise on Various Kinds of Sorbets, or Water Ices</i>...composed between 1692 and
1694...contains the first written recipes on how to mix sugar, salt, snow, and lemon juice,
strawberrries, sour cherries, and other fruit, as well as chocolate, cinnamon water, and different
flavorings. There is also a description of a "milk sorbet that is first cooked," which we could
regard as the birth certificate of ice cream. De'sorbetti, the first book entirely dedicated to the art
of making frozen confections, was published in Naples in 1775. Its author, Filippo Baldini,
discusses different types of sorbets...A separate chapter deals with "milky sorbets," meaning ice
creams, whose medical properties are vigorouly proclaimed."<br>

"A sherbet, basically and historically, is a cold, sweetened, non-alcoholic drink, usually based on a fruit juice. The earliest recorded word for it seems to be sharab, 
the classical Arab term from a sweetened drink. However, in the late Middle Ages this word developed its current Arabic sense...The later Arabic word sharbat
 also entered European languages. In the late 16th century it appeared in Italian as the name of a beverage drunk in Turkey. Then the beverage itself entered Italian 
cuisine, under the name sorbetto. It took this form because the Italians assimiliated it into their verb sorbire, meaning to sip. The Italian sorbetto gave rise to the
 French sorbet, the Spanish sorbete, etc. All these words begin with 's' not with 'sh'. English seems to be the only language which took the word sherbet directly 
from the Turkish, complete with its 'h'...According to the dictionary compiled by Fortiere in the late 17th century, a sorbet in France at that time was also a drink,
 of sugar and lemon pulp. Diderot's great encyclopedia of the 1750s suggests that it remained so during the 18th century. During the 19th century...a sorbet could 
be either a drink or a sort of ice more suitable for drinking than eating, and in the latter case had an alcoholic content."<br>

"Sorbet.
A type of water ice that is softer and more granular than ice cream as it does not contain any fat
or egg yolk. The basic ingredient of a sorbet is fruit juice or puree, wine, spirit or liqueur, or an
infusion (tea or mint). A sugar syrup, sometimes with additional glucose or one or two invert
sugars is added. The mixture should not be beaten during freezing. When it has set, some Italian
meringue can be added to give it volume. Historically, sorbets were the first iced desserts (ice
creams did not appear until ith 18th century). The Chinese introduced them to the Persians and
Arabs who introduced them to the Italians. The word sorbet is a gallicazation of the Italian
sorbetto, derived from Turkish chobet and Arab charah, which simply meant  drink. Sorbets were
originally made of fruit, honey, aromatic substances and snow. Today, the sorbet is served as a
dessert or as a refreshment between courses; at large formal dinners in France, sorbets with an
alcoholic base are served between the main courses, taking the place of the liqueur...formerly
served in the middle of the meal..."<br>

<b>Sorbet course</b><br>
Sorbets (sherbets, ices, iced punches) appear as mid-meal courses in grand European-style dinner menus
 from mid-19th century forwards. Primary souces specify course placement, which varies according complexity of bill of fare.
Generally, the sorbet course comes after the roasts and before the game OR
after the entree and before the roast. 
<p>
Why serve chilled ices in the middle of the meal? Most primary sources do not elucidate.
Presumably? This was common knowledge among the dining elite. Our survey of historic sources returned three possible reasons:<br>
1. To cleanse the palate<br>
...Served between the heaviest meat/entree courses, chilled ices would effectively wash away fatty flavors.<br>
2. To prepare the stomach for additional foodstuffs<br>
...Served as an intermezzo, chilled ices would offer a much needed break from a formally long dining experience.<br>
3. As a modern replacement for the old custom of serving mid-meal liqueur/cordials.<br>
...Plausible, since the original purpose of these alcoholic beverages was medicinal. 
<p>
Sorbets served in this course are generally soft or grainy, providing a texture and flavor break from chewing spiced meats. 
Some sorbets incorporate liqueurs. The course is served in fancy individual glasses for each diner.
<p>
<b>Mrs. A.B. Marshall makes this compelling argument for palate cleansers, circa 1880s.</b> <br>
"The formal Victorian dinner was long, lasting two or even three hours, and consisted of many courses. Ices could appear in two or even three of them. 
The meal was divided into two parts. A soup course came first usually the diner had the choice of a thick soup or a clear 
consomme. Three courses followed: fish, entree, and releve or remove. The latter was a large roast garnished with vegetables. The 
second part of the meal opened with a sorbet or a punch--a water ice flavored with rum or other spirits--thus contrasting with the 
hot liquid at the beginning of the meal. The the diner went on to successive courses of more roast meat, vegetables, and 
sweets. In her <i>Cookery Book</i> Mrs. Marshall describes the character of a sorbet: 
<blockquote>
'Under the term sorbet are now included those ices which are served after the removes. They should be of a light semi-frozen nature, having only just 
sufficient consistency to hold together when piled up. This degree of solidity is a natural consequence of their composition, for the sugar and spirit among their 
ingredients, when properly prepared, will prevent them, under any circumstances, becoming as solid as cream and water ices. They are generally 
prepared by first making an ordinary lemon-water ice, and adding to this some spirit, liqueur, or syrup for flavouring, and fruit for the 
garnish and are named accordingly rum sorbet, cherry sorbet, and so on. They are always served in cups or glasses, one for each 
guest, and many very pretty designs are specially made for this purpose.'
</blockquote>
"The coldness an granular texture of the sorbet, the acidity of the lemon juice, and the slight bitterness from the infused lemon 
peel provide a refreshing contrast to the heat and the unctuous textures of preceding courses. Just how elaborate the 'pretty designs' could be is 
illustrated by Ranhofer's 'Stanley Punch.'...As the Victorian meal drew to a close, the entremet course was served. Nowadays this is 
understood to mean the dessert, but in Mrs. Marshall's day it included vegetables as well, and even the savoury seems originally to have 
belonged to it...Mrs. Marshall's enthusiasm warms when she describes the sweets: <br>
...'The aim of a properly constructed sweet is to convey to the palate the greatest possible amount of pleasure and taste, whilst it is in no 
way either suggestive of nourishment or solidity...Of late ices and iced dishes of various kinds have increased so much in popular 
favor as to form a special, and decidedly important item, at every well arranged dinner.'" <br>

Barbara Ketcham Wheaton [Charles Scribner's Sons:New York] 1976 (p. x-xiv) 
<p>
"Sorbets, etc. The Italian word sorbetto, meaning sherbet, shows the origin of these dishes. Their general character is that of a water ice mixed or 
flavoured with wine or spirits. They are served before the roast in glasses or fancy cups and generally just enough frozen to be piled up in 
the glass..." <br>
---<i>ibid</i> (p. 30) 
<p>
<b>Ancient tradition rediscovered?</b><br>
We are wondering if this practice reflects Galen's humoral theories of the cooling of the stomach. Cooling 
liquids (limonades &c.) may have had this effect. Possible collolary: Italian menus place salad in the middle of the dinner to "lighten the load" 
of the diner's stomach. Both practices would redirect the palate and prepare the stomache to accept additional foodstuffs.
<p> 
Evidence suggests the sorbet course may have been borrowed from Middle Eastern traditions.<br>
"The water ices of the Turks and Arabs were soft and semi-liquid, rather like slushy Italian granita. They were often eaten between courses, as soup is in China, to 
refresh and clear the palate."<br>

trays resting on stands of polished wood and mosaics about eighteen inches high. Silverware was not needed; the flat bread called nan served as plate, spoon, fork and sustenance 
all in one...The soft music of flute and tambourine added to the pleasure of the meal. Between courses servants brought bowls of rosewater for washing fingers...Over low braziers kebabs were broiled to succulence, served with a spiced 
sauce of creamy yogurt or mast, as the Persians called the buttermilk clabber. Huge bowls of pilaf or pilau...were intricately seasoned with nuts, buts of chicken or lamb, spices, 
herbs, and fruit. A sweet chilled fruit drink called sherbet might come next, or a salad of water cress and lettuce."<br>

impossible to make good ices with wines and spirits. In fact, he wrote six pages of explanation, complete with experiments, to prove that they did not freeze properly and would
result in diluted ices. Wines were bad and spirits were worse according to Emy. Freezing diminished their taste, quality and fragrance. The only possible exceptions were maraschino
liqueur, l'eau de creole, or rum; a ratafia or cordial made with orange flowers; and muscat wine. He thought it was better simply to drink the wines and liqueures at a normal
temperature than to turn them into bad ices. But he said that, because he was afraid some people would insist on having them regardless of his explanations he would
provide instructions for doing it correctly. And he did, In another section of his book, after repeating that he did not recommend the practice, he offered several

Did you know that malteds, <a href="foodicecream.html#milkshake">milk shakes</a> and other soda fountain treats were originally concocted
as health foods? The history of malted milk and milk shakes are interesting and
interconnected:<p>

"Malted milk...Originally created in 1887 as an easily digested infant's food made from an extract
of wheat and malted barley combined with milk and made into a powder called "diastoid" by
James and William Horlick of Racine, Wisconsin, this item, under the name "Horlick's Malted
Milk," was featured by the Walgreen drugstore chain as part of a chocolate milk shake, which
itself became known as a "malted" and became one of the most popular soda-fountain
drinks."<br>
---<i>The Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani
[Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 196-197)
<p>
"Malted milk was a trade name registered by William Horlick of Racine, Wisconsin. Horlick supposedly coined the name "malted milk,"
but his formula resembled one already being marketed in England. He promoted his mixture of dried milk extracts of malted 
barley and wheat as a food supplement for infants and invalids. As such, it was widely availalbe in drugstores, both as as
powder and as a tablet. Enterprising druggists soon discovered that they could use powdered malted milk to make a cheap 
syurp to flavor drinks. When ice cream was added, a malted was both tasty and filling, since the dried milk and the ice cream 
had a high fat content.  Druggists promoted the drink as a complete meal and charged a premium price. Horlick's malted milk was 
the first in the United States but it was widely imitated by other manufacturers, including Carnation and Borden's. Although
Horlick protested that thes other companies were infringing on his rights, his competitors cited legal precedents in their 
favor. Horlick persuaded some state associations of drugstore owners to boycott his rivals' products, and there was much 
animosity among the malted milk manufacturers....Malted milk sold steadily for decades than then became a fad in the 1920s, largely
due to an electric blender invented by Fred Osius. Osius, who lived in Racine, prefected a mixer that blended a smooth,
thick drink. At first, he tried to interest Horlick in his invention, but the malted milk magnate ridiculed him. In 1910, 
Osseus made a trip to New York City, tring to find investors but was unsuccessful and ran out of money. In order to pay his
way back to Wisconsin, he persuaded the owner of the Caswell-Massey store on Broadway to take a blender as collateral for
a loan. This blender was a big hit with Caswell-Massey's customers, who were fascinated by the way it worked. The sales 
manager for a leading manufacturer of milk products saw this blender at Caswell-Massey and immediately grasped its
potentia. Subsequently, his company arranged to buy blenders from Ossius and give them to soda fountain operators who bought 100 
pounds of its malted milk. Bulk malted milk sales increased from less than one million pounds annually in 1910 to more than
35 million in 1926. The drinks were so popular that several chains of malted milk shops sprang up on the West Coast in the
1920s."<br>

"Milk shake also appeared in the late 1880s, but the term then usually meant a sturdy, healthful
egg nog type of drink, with eggs, whiskey, etc., served as a tonic as well as a treat. Since malted
milk was also considered a tonic, the combined malted milk shake was a logical step and in the
early 1900s people were asking for the new treat, often with ice cream, and before 1910 were
using the shorter terms shake and malt (the longer word malted being somewhat more common in
the Eastern states). Malt shop was a term of the late 1930s, usually being a typical soda fountain
of the period, especially one used by students as a meeting place or hangout."<br>

"It is not known exactly when milkshakes were introduced at soda fountains, but they were popular by the mid-1880s. Tufts
patented his Lightning Shaker for mixing milkshakes in 1884, and trade publications printed numerous ads for shakers in the 1890s.
These handcrafted machines agitated glasses filled with liquid, producing smooth, thick drinks...Tufts' 1890 trade catalog said
that the milkshake "has sprung into great popularity in the South in a surprisingly short time...It can be made of any flaor, but
vanilla and chocolate are the most desirable flavors. This catalog included a milkshake recipe, which instructed the 
dispenser to fill a tumbler half-full of shaved ice, add 1.5 ounces of syrup, finish filling the glass with milk, and shake well.
For a little extra punch, the recipe said to add port wine. In order to make a richer shake, upscale fountains used a 
combination of heavy cream or ice cream and milk. While most milkshakes sold for a nickel, these creamier shakes cost 10 to 15
cents. <i>Saxe's New Guide, or Hints to Soda Dispensers</i> warned against giving the customer a wide choice of milkshake flavors 
because it slowed down service while the dispenser waited for the patron to decide."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Neapolitan ice cream</b></font><br>

Although Italian ice and granita trace their roots to ancient times, Neapolitan ice cream seems to
be a 19th century phenomenon. Recipes for the fancy molds (bombes) or bricks of vanilla,
chocolate and strawberry (sometimes pistachio) were often included in 19th century European
and American cook books. This was a function of technology (refrigeration advancements) and
collective gastronomy (preference for complicated presentations). Why "Neapolitan?" The
peoples of Napoli are credited for introducing their famous ice creams to the world in the 19th
century.  At that time, pressed blocks composed of special flavors were trendy.  The best ones
were made with "Neapolitan-style" ice creams. 
<p>
A survey of historic cookbooks confirms the term "Neapolitan," as it relates to ice cream, denotes
both a recipe (for ice cream) and method (combining several flavors in a mold). It also reveals
there is no "official" triumvirate of flavors. Most often cited are vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and
pistachio. It is not unusual to include a sherbet or fruit-flavored ice as well.
<p>
This is what the food historians have to say:
<br>
"Neapolitan slice. A slice of ice-cream cake made with mousse mixture and ordinary ice cream,
presented in a small pleated paper case. Neapolitan ice cream consists of three layers, each of a
different color and flavor (chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla), moulded into a block and cut into
slices. Neapolitan ice-cream makers were famous in Paris at the beginning of the 19th century,
especially Tortoni, creator of numerous ice-cream cakes."<br>

"[18th century] confectioners's shops [were] very often run by Italians. Consequently ice creams

However small the pieces, the block should be cut so that each person gets a little of each kind; to
do this, slice downwards first, then cut the slices thorugh once or twice in the contrary direction.
They are generally laid on a lace paper on an ice plate. Four or five kinds are usually put in the
mould, though three sorts will do. The following will serve as a guide in arranging: First, vanilla
cream, then raspberry or cherry or currant water; coffee or chocoalte in the middle; the strawberry
cream, with lemon or orange or pine-apple water to finish. A cream ice, flavoured with any
liqueur, a brown bread cream flavoured with brandy, with a couple of bright-coloured water ices,
form another agreeable mixture. Tea cream may be introduced into almost any combination unless
coffee be used. Banana cream, pistachio or almond cream, with cherry water and damson or
strawberry water, will be found very good. The spoon shown [Neapolitan Ice Spoon] has a
double use; the bowl is for putting the mixture into the mould, and the handle is for levelling it;
naturally, it is equally useful for other ices. The boxes may be had in tin at much less cost than
pewter;they are also sold small enought to make single ices, but these are much more troublesome
to prepare. After filling the moulds, if no cave, "bed" in ice in the usual way."<br>

<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Oyster ice cream?</b></font><br>
Our survey of historic cookbooks (USA, English, French), oyster chronicles, and ice cream history books returns one curious recipe 
for oyster cream, served frozen: Mary Randolph's <i>The Virginia Housewife</i> [1824]. It appears, without comment, 
listed with various frozen desserts. A close examination of this recipe reveals it would have turned a savory, rather than
sweet dish. Recipe placement may speak more to method than course. Perhaps Mrs. Randolph found this recipe a bizarre as we do
today. Thomas Jefferson, Mrs. 
Randolph's relative famous for ice cream experiments, may have liked this item. Might this explain why Mrs. Randolph chose to 
record it for posterity? We find no print evidence 
connecting George Washington with this frozen treat, except for coexistence in general period and place. 
<p>
Fast forward two centuries. Oyster ice cream 
was featured on the American debut of Iron Chef, a Japanese television competition, 1999. We find no print evidence 
suggesting this is a traditional Japanese dish or that it tickled American palates. 
<p>
"<i>The Virginia House-Wife</i> by Mary Randolph, published in 1824, was the first American cookbook with a significant section on 
ice cream The book became the most influential American cookbook of the nineteenth century and was especially popular in the 
South...She had many recipes for ices and ice creams...Oddly, among her ice cream recipes was one for frozen oyster cream. This was simply 
oyster soup, strained and frozen. She did not explain when or, more important, why it would be served." <br>

till they are sufficiently done, and thicken the soup with four spoonsful of flour, two gills of rich cream, and the yelks of six 
new laid eggs beaten well; boil it a few minutes after thickening it put in. Take care that it does not curdle, and that the flour is not in 
lumps: serve it up wtih the last oysters that were put in. If the flavour of thyme be agreeable you may put in a little, but take care

<a name="parfait">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Parfait</b></font><br>
The orginal parfait was 19th century frozen coffee-flavoured French ice dessert constructed in
parfait-shaped (tall and thin) ice cream molds. This dessert was not served in tall, thin glassware
as we know today. It was extracted from the mold (of similar shape) and served on decorated
plates. 
<p>
     Layered, molded ice cream treats (with fruits, syrups & liqueurs) were quite popular by the
mid-19th century both in Europe and America. They were presented in many fabulous shapes
much to the delight of diners of all ages. Parfait, as is currently known by Americans is a
multi-layered ice cream treat presented in "parfait" glasses. These glasses are typically thin and
tall. The parfait is usually made with rich vanilla ice cream accented with liqueur or other other
syrup (chocolate, strawberry) . The most notable difference between an American parfait and the
ever popular Ice Cream Sundae is the dish. The parfait is presented tall & thin; the sundae is most
often served in a wide-mouth glass that may or may not have a stem. The use of liqueur is
generally relegated to the parfait. Did you know? Parfait is the French word for "perfect."
<p>

"Parfait. An iced dessert made with double (heavy) cream, which gives it smoothness, prevents it
from melting too quickly and enables it to be cut into slices. Originally the parfait was a
coffee-flavoured ice cream; today, the basic mixture is a flavoured custard-cream, a flavoured
syrup mixed with egg yolks or a fruit puree, which is blended with whipped ccream and then
frozen. There is a special parfait mould in the shape of a cylindar with one slightly rounded
end...In Britain and the United States a parfait is also the name of a whipped dessert."<br>
--<i>Larousse Gastonomique</i>, Completely revised and updated [Clarkson Potter:New York]
2001 (p. 840)
<p>

"Parfait. A name properly used of a rich frozen dessert, similar to a bombe and often made in a
bombe mold. A typical parfait is composed of two or several elements (a lining for the mould and
a filling, which may itself be layered) and is flavoured with a liqueur, or with coffee, chocolate,
praline, etc. In North America, the term has come to mean something different, namely a
combination of fruit and ice cream, served in a tall narrow glass which exposes to view the
various layers of the confection. This sort of parfait is not a frozen dessert. However, the frozen
dessert version can be frozen in individual parfait glasses, rather than in a single mould, so there is
a relationship between the two different things."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
575)
<p>
The oldest recipe we have with the name parfait is from a French cookbook dated 1869. It is for a
coffee-ice confection.<br><blockquote>

<b>"Parfait au cafe</b><br>
Roast 1/2 lb. of coffee in a copper pan;<br>
Boil 3 pints of double cream; put the coffee in it; cover the stewpan, and let the coffee steep for
an hour;<br>
Put 12 yolks of eggs in a stewpan, with 1/2 lb. of pounded sugar;<br>
Strain the cream; add it to the egg, in the stewpan; stir over the fire, without boiling, until it
thickens, and strain it through a tammy cloth;<br>
Set a freezing-pot and a parfait-mould in some pounded ice, and bay salt;<br>
Put the cream in the freezing-pot, and work it with the spatula; <br>
When the cream is partly frozen, add 1/2 gill of syrup at 32 degrees (probably Baume); continue
working the cream, and, when the syrup is well mixed, add another 1/2 gill of syrup, and 1 quart
of well-whipped cream; Fill the mould with the iced cream; close it hermetically, and embed it in
the ice for two hours; Turn the parfait out of the mould on to a napkin, on a dish; and serve."<br>

What is Philadelphia-style ice cream? Excellent question. Generalists claim it is the "finest quality" American frozen confection. Cookbooks and professional
 industry texts confirm Philadelphia-style ice cream is uncooked. It does not contain whole eggs, though it sometimes contains egg whites. <a href="foodicecream.html#frenchicecream">

<b>PHILADELPHIA, HOME OF AMERICAN ICE CREAM</b><br>
"Philadelphia became renowned for its ice cream, and the phrase 'Philadelphia ice cream,' used since the early nineteenth century, came to mean a specifically 
American style of rich ice cream. One proud Philadelphia confectioner of the nineteenth century James W. Parkinson,...wrote of the prejudicial distinction made 
between American and French frozen desserts."

<p>
"Philadelphia ice cream is a term synonymous with the best in frozen confections. Though not invented here (forms of ice creams have been around since the 13th 
century) Philadelphians developed an impeccable reputation for ice cream by the end of the 18th century. Victor Collet and James Parkinson built their businesses 
on elegant glaces and ices impossibly molded into unusual ornaments."

<p>
"What is this Philadelphia ice cream?</b> It means ice cream "Simon pure," made of the richest ingredients. When American was young and ice cream  was 
"that new dessert." the very best of it was made by the Quakers. So it was that when anyone anywhere wanted to claim high honor for his ice cream he prefixed it
 with the name Philadelphia. This real-thing ice cream has but three ingredients in its basic recipe: cream, sugar and a touch of the vanilla bean. Fruits and other
 flavors can be added as you will..."<br>

"Everyone knows Philadelphia as the city of brotherly love where our independence was declared in 1776, but how may of you are aware that it is the ice cream 
capital of the country, maybe of the world? When Philadelphia became the seat of government and George Washington the first President, "iced creams" as they 
were then called were often served at the presidential Thursday dinners. We believe they were not quite the same as our luscious delights made commercially or at
 home in an ice cream freezer, but were mixtures of cream, sugar and eggs beaten in metal bowls over ice so that they had more the texture of the soft ice cream
 sold in certain places today. After the great exposition of 1876 Philadelphia became known across the country for the excellence of its ice cream, by then a 
popular American delicacy, and to this day the words "Philadelphia ice cream" connote the highest quality. Philadelphia confectioners were famed for their ice 
cream."<br>
---"Philly the Ice Cream Capital," James A. Beard, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, August 5, 1971 (p. J4)
<p>
<b>LEGAL DEFINITIONS</b><br>
In the early 20th century, Pure Food and Drug laws were enacted to ensure standardized quality for the American consumer. The legal definition of ice cream, 
including Philadelphia style, was the topic of hot debate. In 1916, the US Supreme Court acknowledged two definitions for Philadelphia ice cream:
Hutchinson Ice Cream V. Iowa (242 US) 153 [1916]:
<p>
"The ice cream of commerce is not iced or frozen cream. It is a frozen confection-a compound. The ingredients of this compound may vary widely in character, in 
the number used, and in the proportions in which they are used. These variations are dependent upon the ingenuity, skill, and judgment of the maker, the relative 
cost at a particular time or at a particular place of the possible ingredients, and the requirements of the market in respect to taste or selling price. Thus, some 
Philadelphia ice cream is made of only cream, sugar, and a vanilla flavor. In making other Philadelphia ice cream the whites of eggs are added; and according to 
some formulas vanilla ice cream may be made without any cream or milk whatsoever; for instance, by proper manipulation of the yolks of eggs, the whites of eggs, 
sugar, syrup, and the vanilla bean. All of these different compounds are commonly sold as ice cream; and none of them is necessarily unwholesome." <br>

"Our tariffs have supplied diverting examples showing that laws are not always what they seem, and not always passed for the assigned motive, whether personal or 
partisan. But these examples usually are too obscure for popular understanding. Generally, such incidents pertain to the higher circles into which the common people 
are intruders...The highest court in the land has within a few weeks pondered over the problem of what is ice cream, and whether there can be such a thing as ice 
cream without a drop of cream..."Some Philadelphia ice cream"--only "some"--is made of only cream, sugar, and a vanilla flavor." Happy those who get it. But 
observe, either Philadelphia ice creams, number unstated, "may be made without any milk or cream whatsoever; for instance, by proper manipulation of the yolks of 
eggs, the whites of eggs sugar, syurp and the vanilla bean. All of these different compounds are commonly sold as ice cream, and none of them is necessarily 
unwholesome. The people's prosecutor claimed that it was a fraud and a crime to sell ice cream without at least a specified percentage of cream. The sellers of the 
miscellanous and mysterious compound defended on the ground that one man has a good a right as another to say what he shall put into his ice cream formula. But 
the Supreme Court found that the buyer also has his rights. He had the right to know what he is buying, and he cannot know without laws implementing standards 
on the point to which he attaches most importance, that at least some milk and butter shall be included in what he buys as ice cream."<br>

 broken small, with four handsful of salt mixt among the ice; when you see your cream get thick round the edges of your tin, stir it well, and put it in again till it 
becomes quite thick; when the cream is all froze up, take it out of the tin, and put it into the mould you intend to turn it out of: mind that you put a piece of paper on
 each end, between the lids and the ice cream, put on the top lid, and have another tub of ice ready, as before, put the mould in the middle, with the ice under and
 over it; let it stand four hours, and do not turn it out before you want it; then dip the mould into cold spring water, take off the lids and paper, and turn it into a 
plate. You may do any sort of fruit the same way.<br>---<i>The New Art of Cookery, According to the Present Practice</i>, Richard Briggs [W. Spotswood, R. Campbell, and B. Jonhson:Philadelphia PA] 1792 (p. 399-400)

<a name="popsicles">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Popsicles</b></font><br>
Ice cream, ices and other frosty treats were sold in cities, amusement parks, boardwalks
and and resort areas in the during WWI by a number of portable vehicles. These ranged from
hand-pushed carts to goat-pulled mini-wagons to bicycle-propelled carts to horsedrawn/electric
trucks. Folks who make a living selling ice treats from carts were known as "hokey pokey" men.
How long before these treats would melt? That would be determined by the quality of the cart and
the temperature of the day.
<o>
The history of the popsicle is a fascnating topic unto itself. Like the history of many popular
frozen treats, it is full of conflicting claims and culinary folklore. While Frank Epperson is
generally credited for "inventing" the popsicle (first called the Epsicle, after himself), there is
ample evidence that frozen fruit treats and juice bars existed in the late 19th century. These treats
were often hawked by people of Italian descent, who were versed in the fine art of granita. Even
the Epperson story has many "versions." The Epperson story sticks not because he was the first,
but because he was the first to mass market this product.
<p>
<b>Frank Epperson's popsicle</b><br>
"The third member of the great novelty trimuvirate of the 1920s was born on a cold
eureka-shouting morning in New Jersey in 1923. The inventor was Frank Epperson, who made
lemonade from a specially prepared powder that he sold at an Oakland, California, amusement
park. While visiting friends in New Jersey, he prepared a batch of special lemonade and
inadvertantly left a glass of it on a windowsill with a spoon in it. The temperature went down
below zero during the night and in the morning Epperson saw the glass. He picked it up by the
spoon handle and ran hot water over the glass freeing the frozen mass. In his hand was the first
Epsicle, later to be known as the Popsicle. Epperson saw immediately the potential of what he
held in his hand and applied for a patent, which was granted in 1924. He was fortunate, because
research conducted by <i>The Ice Cream Review</i> in 1925 revealed that a major ice cream
company was experimenting with "frozen suckers" at the time of the windowsill incident, and as
far back as 1872 two men doing business as Ross and Robbins sold a frozen-fruit confection on a
stick, which they called the Hokey-Pokey."<br>
---<i>Great American Ice Cream Book</i>, Paul Dickson [Atheneum:New York] 1972 (p. 83)
<p>
"In 1905 an eleven-year-old boy named Frank Epperson, of Oakland, California, accientally left a
mixing stick in a glass of juice on a windowsill while visiting friends in New Jersey. The juice
froze
with the stick in it, enabling the ice to be held in the hand and licked.In 1922 Epperson introduced
this new "icelollipop" at a fireman's ball in Oakland, California, and called it an "Epsicle," then
later "Popsicle." (Frozen "juice bars" had been known in the nineteenth century, including one
called the "Hokey Pokey," but none was marketed well until the Popsicle in 1923.)"<br>

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, both of the terms "sociable" and "social" can mean
an informal party or gathering. The term "sociable," is older, dating in print to 1826. "Social"
dates to 1876. These gatherings are generally held under the auspices of an organized body
(church, school). Socials were meant to entertain large numbers of people. In context, they
generally were held for three reasons:<br>
<b>1. Community event</b><br>
---"social" meaning the opportunity to catch up with one's neighbor<br>
<b>2. Theme party</b><br>
---"social" meaning games played around a theme<br>
<b>3. Fundraiser</b><br>
---"social" meaning collecting money for a social/political/humanitarian cause

<a name="sundaes">
<font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Ice Cream Sundaes</b></font><br>
Who invented the ice cream sundae & why? Excellent question with several answers. Food historians generally agree on the 
<a href="foodicecream.html#sundaename">origin & creative spelling of the name</a>. Why is it served with <a href="foodicecream.html#cherriesontop">cherries 
on top</a>?

<p>
  
  "As for the specfic birthplace of the dish, two possibilities emerge as the most likely among many
  contenders. Neither place can offer conclusive dates, so one can pick between, "Heavenston"
  (favored by the National Dairy Council, among others) and Two Rivers (championed by such
  divers sources as the old Ice Cream Review and H.L. Mencken in his American Language). 
       The first claim goes back to the 1890s in Evanston, Illinois (then widely known as "Chicago's
  Heaven" or "Heavenston"), where civic piety had reached such a state that it became the first
  American community to recognize and legislate against the "Sunday Soda Menace." This
  prompted confectioners to create Sundays so that they could do business on the Sabbath.
  Ironically the soda was later given a strong boost from this community when the Evanston-based
  Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) championed it as a pleasant alternative to
  alcoholic drinks.
       The Two Rivers, Wisconsin, claim goes back to the same era...was created when a youth
  named George Hallauer went to Ed Berner's soda fountain for a rich of ice cream. As the ice
  cream was being scooped, the daring Hallauer spied a bottle of chocolate syrup normally used in
  sodas and asked Berner to pour some of it over his ice cream. Berner sampled the concoction
  and liked it enough to begin featuring "ice cream with syrup" in his shop for the same price as a
  dish of ice cream. The name sundae was give to the dish when George Giffy, an ice cream parlor
  proprietor in nearby Manitowoc, was forced by customer demand to serve the popular Berner
  concoction. Giffy was convinced that the nickel dish would put him out of business and at first
  served it only as a Sunday loss leader. In Manitowoc it soon became known as "the Sunday." Giffy
  found that he was making money on the dish and began advertising his "Ice Cream Sundaes,"
  with the spelling changed so that it would lose its Sunday-only association.
     Regardless of the origin, by 1900, midwestern soda-fountain supply salesmen were carrying
  samples of tulip-shaped "Sundae Specials."<br>
  ---<i>The Great American Ice Cream Book</i>, Paul Dickson [Atheneum:New York] 1972 (p. 64-6)
<p>
"Little is known with certainty about the sundae's birth: it originated in the late 1880s or early 1890s; one of the 
first published sundae recipes appeared in <i>Modern Guide for Soda Dispensers</i> in 1897; and sundaes were very popular by
1900. Many accounts of the sundae's invention have been published, but there is no definative evidence about it. The best-known
explanation for the sundae is that it was created to circumvent Blue Laws banning the sale of ice cream sodas on Sunday. 
Beginning in the colonial era, Blue Laws were promulgated to prohibit certain activities on the Sabbath...Over the years, Blue Laws 
banned many activities, but enforcement was very lax and sporadic...In 1890, only a few Blue Laws expressly mentioned 
confectionery or soda water. Maryland banned Sunday sales of soda and mineral waters along with tobacco, candy, and 
alcoholic beverages. Louisiana specifically permitted Sunday sales at drugstores, apothecary shops, bakeries, restaurants,
theaters and other places of amusement as long as no intoxicating drinks were sold. Minnesota allowed the sale of 
confectioenry, drugs, and medicines "in a quiet and orderly manner." Texas law permitted drugstores to open on Sunday and specified
ice cream among the articles that could be sold on the Sabbath. Utah's Blue Laws banned a long list of activities on Sunday, 
but they permitted many businesses, including drugstores and restaurants, to open. Given the number and scope of the Blue Laws, it is 
not surprising that the invention of the sundae is often attributed to a druggist trying to circumvent the law against serving 
soda on Sunday. In one version, President Theodore Roosevelt was responsible for the sundae because he banned ice cream
sodas on Sunday and fountain operators responded by creating the new soda-less treat. This tale probably originated because
Roosevelt, while serving as head of New York City's Police Board, made well-publicized attempts to enforce the Sunday closing law for
saloons. However, it is unlikely that Roosevelt was the father of the ice cream sundae because the New York State legal code specifically
permitted the sale of confectionery and drugs on Sunday. The best-known Blue Laws story concerns Evanston, Illinois...
Evanston's pious town fathers passed an ordinance prohibiting the sale fo ice cream sodas on the Sabbath. Some ingenious druggist
decided to serve ice cream with syrup but no soda, there by complying with the letter of the law, if not the spirit. 
Evanston's local historians hae identified this clever druggist as either William C. "Deacon" Garwood or Newton P. Williams...
In a variation on this theme, Cleveland, Ohio, also claimed to be the birthplace of the sundae...one druggist with a flourishing
Sunday trade started serving ice cream topped with fruit. He advertised this treat as a "fruit Sunday," but his regular
customers started ordering it on weekdays, too. So he changed the spelling to "sundae."...In another version of the sundae's origin
a necessity was the mother invention. A New Orleans druggist had a brisk soda water trade, but one hot day he discovered
that his fountain wasn't working properly and he was unable to draw andy soda. However, he had plenty of syrups and ice
cream on hand. After hastily conferring with his clerks, he decided to serve ice cream with syrup on top...A similar tale 
of necessity places the birth of the ice cream sundae at Stoddard Brothers drugstore in Buffalo, New York...Ithaca [NY]
also claimed that distinction, and there are two accounts...The Red Cross Pharmacy was located directly across the street from the 
barroom of the Ithaca Hotel. Because the bar was closed on the Sabbath, the druggist decided to offer a special
Sunday treat to attract the bar's displaced clientele to his fountain...The second Ithaca legend involves a young
clergyman who regularly stopped at the Christiance and Dofflemeyer Drugstore for a dish of ice cream after his Sunday
sermon. One hot Sunday, neither ice cream nor soda water appealed to him because he was in the mood for something different. So
he asked the fountain operator to pour cherry syrup over a dish of ice cream. He was delighted with the new treat and named
it "Sunday."...Another legend about the sundae's birth recognizes Geroge Hallauer as the father and E.C. Berners as the midwife [Two Rivers, WI]..."

<a name="sundaename">
<b>Why call it "sundae?"</b><br>
"Since there is no definative answer as to who invented the sundae, it's not surprising that the spelling is also a mystery.
However, it is certain that the spelling was not standardized for many decades. Early spelling include sunday, sondie, sundi, 
sundhi, sundae, and sundaye. Linguists have suggested that sundae ultimately became the standard spelling because religious
leaders felt that the word Sunday was sacred and should not be commercialized. They have also theorized that the name was
chosen because the dessert was only sold on Sunday or because the Sabbath required a special dessert. According to
<i>The Washington Star</i>, the treat was originaly called Friday but was changed to Sunday because Friday was thought to be
unlucky."<br>

The <i>Dispenser's Formulary</i> [Soda Fountain Publications:New York] 1925 lists 275 sundae recipes! Among the more creative

Pike's Peak, Rubaiyat, Tasty Toasty, Uncle Jake, U-Wana and Yama Yama. This book provides guidance on names:<p>
"Words of warning can advantageously be sounded in the matter of naming sundaes. The names in the following pages are standard
in many cases. A great number of the following formulas are prize winners in the Soda Fountain's monthly contests and as such, have
a wide reputation. There is a always a danger in carrying the fancy name idea too far--for a fine name does not of necesstiy mean
a fine sundae, while the too fancy names are apt to be fantastic and even funny to one who possesses a sense of humor. Stick to
original names of the sundaes and help to make them more and more standard and uniform...A decidedly local event or an intimate
personal touch is the only reasonable excuse that can be advanced for the use of a specially coined name." (p. 105)

"In serving sundaes it is important that the appeal should be made to the eye as well as to the palate. It is poor policy to slap
together a messy concoction. Never let the syrups run over the edge of the sundae glass. See that the handle of the spoon is not
sticky with syrup. Place nuts, cherries, or knobs of whipped cream carefully on the sundae so that the effect may be pleasing."<br>

  "Sundaes and Fancy Ice Cream Dishes.<br>
  Before the idea of topping ice cream with nuts, fruits and fancy dressings originated, soda
  dispensers were more or less handicapped to show distinct forms of originality. Now the mixture
  of ice creams, and the arrangements of fancy dishes not only furnishes the dispenser an outlet for
  his ideas, but they produce a big revenue for the modern soda fountain. In serving ice cream, it is
  suggested that a china or silver cup be used. Wafers, mints, and other tidbits are very nice to
  serve along with the ice cream. A small glass of ice water should always be served with each order.
  The following formulas are for plain and fancy sundaes or eclairs:<p>
  <b>Cherry Sunday</b><br>
  1 disher of vanilla ice cream<br>
  Ladle of cherries and top with a large red cherry<br>
  ...<br>
  <b>White Cherry Sundae</b><br>

  Ladle of white cherries. Top with a large white cherry<br>

  <b>French Violet Sunday</b><br>
  Place a disher of vanilla ice cream in a sundae cup and over it pour a ladle of French violet<br>
  bisque... Top with a red cherry<br>

  <b>Chong special</b><br>
  Into a tall slender frappe glass place a small disher of strawberry ice cream, enough to fill about
  one-half of the glass. Over this pour a little caramel syrup, then in the remainder of the glass place
  a disher of chocolate ice cream. Over this pour a ladle of marshmallow dressing, sprinkle with
  ground nuts, and top with a whole cherry.<br>
