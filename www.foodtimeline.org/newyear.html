<font color="#8e2323"><b>Symbolism of New Year's Day foods</b></font><br>
In most cultures, foods prepared on New Year's Day bring good luck. 
Which foods? Depends upon the culture. Recurring themes are green (life), gold & coins (money/wealth) and pork/ham (because
pigs root forward as they eat, embracing challenges).
<p>
"As New Year's Day approaches, people around the world will plan for the coming year, eager to get off to
the best possible start! Many people will "eat for luck"-they plan to eat special foods that, by tradition, are
supposed to bring them good luck. Throughout history, people have eaten certain foods on New Year's
Day, hoping to gain riches, love, or other kinds of good fortune during the rest of the year. For people of
several nationalities, ham or pork is the luckiest thing to eat on New Year's Day. How did the pig become
associated with the idea of good luck? In Europe hundreds of years ago, wild boars were caught in the
forests and killed on the first day of the year. Also, a pig uses its snout to dig in the ground in a forward
direction. Maybe people liked the idea of moving forward as the new year began, especially since pigs are
also associated with plumpness and getting plenty to eat. However the custom arose, Austrians, Swedes,
and Germans frequently choose pork or ham for their New Year's meal. They brought this tradition with
them when they settled in different regions of the United States. New Englanders often combine their pork
with sauerkraut to guarantee luck and prosperity for the coming year. Germans and Swedes may pick
cabbage as a lucky side dish, too. In other places, turkey is the meat of choice. Bolivians and some
people in New Orleans follow this custom. But other people claim that eating fowl (such as turkey, goose,
or chicken) on New Year's Day will result in bad luck. The reason? Fowl scratch backward as they search
for their food, and who wants to have to "scratch for a living"? Frequently, fish is the lucky food. People in
the northwestern part of the United States may eat salmon to get lucky. Some Germans and Poles choose
herring, which may be served in a cream sauce or pickled. other Germans eat carp. Sometimes sweets or
pastries are eaten for luck. In the colony of New Amsterdam, now New York, the Dutch settlers still enjoy
these treats...In some places, a special cake is made with a coin baked inside. Such cakes
are traditional in Greece, which celebrates Saint Basil's Day and New Year's at the same time. The Saint
Basil's Day cake (vasilopeta) is made of yeast dough and flavored with lemon. The person who gets the
slice with the silver or gold coin is considered very lucky! Many of the luck-bringing foods are round or
ring-shaped, because this signifies that the old year has been completed. Black-eyed peas are an
example of this, and they are part of one of New Year's most colorful dishes, Hoppin' John, which is eaten
in many southern states. Hoppin' John is made with black-eyed peas or dried red peas, combined with
hog jowls, bacon, or salt pork. Rice, butter, salt, or other vegetables may be added. The children in the
family might even hop around the table before the family sits down to eat this lucky dish. In Brazil, lentils
are a symbol of prosperity, so lentil soup or lentils with rice is prepared for the first meal of the New Year.
Thousands of miles away, the Japanese observe their New Year's tradition of eating a noodle called
toshikoshi soba. (This means "sending out the old year.") This buckwheat noodle is quite long, and those
who can swallow at least one of them without chewing or breaking it are supposed to enjoy good luck and
a long life. Finally, Portugal and Spain have an interesting custom. As the clock strikes midnight and the
new year begins, people in these countries may follow the custom of eating twelve grapes or raisins to
bring them luck for all twelve months of the coming year!" <br>
---"Eat for Luck!," Victoria Sherrow & David Helton, <i>Children's Digest</i>, Jan/Feb 94 (p. 20) 
<p>
"Whether New Year's day is celebrated on Jan. 1 according to the Gregorian calendar, in September or October as the Jews' 
Rosh Hashanah or in midwinter by Asians, foods serve as edible talismans to assure luck, happiness or prosperity in the
coming year. The notion, for example, that eating gold-colored food will put money in your pocket is common in Peru, where 
papas a la huanchaina, a potato dish tinted with tumeric or with a saffron-colored spiced called tadillo, is
served on New Year's Eve. In China, dumplings made from golden egg pancakes, crisply gilded spring rolls and oranges are the 
aureat foods appropriate for the Chinese New Year's celebration...The Chinese also value fish. A whole one is preferred,
suggesting that prosperity has favored you wtih more than you can eat. Pork is on the New Year's table in many cultures, 
connoting riches because at one time having a pig to slaughter guaranteed food for the coming year. In Italy and in southern parts of
the United States, pork is eaten in the form of sausage, stuffed pig's trotters (zampone), ham hocks or pig's knuckles, invariably
accompanied by a dish of dried beans. The Italians eat lentils, or lenticchie, which since Roman times have represented coins...
parsley decorates the dish because it was thought to ward off evil spirits. In the American South, greens are added to 
black-eyed peas or hoppin' John (black-eyed peas with rice). The symbolism is straightforward: the greens represented dollars 
and the black-eyed peas coins. Dried beans, garnished or plain, represent the changing over of years, for they can be stored
throughout the winter and then be planted to create the harvest. Sometimes a silver coin or trinket is buried in a dish of black-eyed
peas or hoppin' John, providing an extra measure of good luck to the person finding it...In Spain...12 grapes are eaten just
before midnight, one for each chime of the clock. Good luck will come to those who finish the grapes before the final 
stroke."<br>

"New Year's Celebrations. Although champage has become de rigeur as midnight strikes, no single food
epitomizes the contemporary New Year's holiday. The menu may be luxurious caviar at a New Year's Eve
bacchanalia or a sobering hoppin' John on New Year's Day. Celebrations marking the inexorable march of
Father Time often involve foods imbued with symbolism, such as in the Pennsylvania Dutch New Year's
tradition of sauerkraut (for wealth) and pork--the pig roots forward into the future, unlike the Christmas
turkey, which buries the past by scratching backward in the dirt. Seventeeth-century Dutch immigrants in
the Hudson River valley welcomed the New Year by "opening the house" to family and friends. The
custom was adapted by English colonists, who used brief, strictly choreographed January 1 social calls for
gentlemen to renew bonds or repair frayed relationships. Ladies remained at home, offering elegantly
arrayed collations laden with cherry bounce, wine, hot punch, and cakes and cookies, often flavored with
the Dutch signatures of caraway, coriander, cardamom, and honey. Embossed New Year's 'cakes," from
the Dutch nieuwjaarskoeken--made by pressing a cookie-like dough into carved wooden boards
decorated with flora and fauna--were a New York specialty throughout the nineteenth century...The New
York custom of open house spread westward in the nineteeth century...In the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries those of French and English backgrounds celebrated the twelve days of Christmas with gifts of
food and festive dinners on January 1...African Americans in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
made one of the most enduring contributions to the modern holiday. Starting in the Carolinas but
extending throughout the South, hoppin' John and greens became traditional New Year's fare, black-eyed
peas bringing luck and the rice (which swelled in the cooking) and greens (like money) bringing prosperity.
In the early twentieth century Japanese Americans adopted the open house tradition, serving glutinous
rice dishes, soups, boiled lobsters (signifying health and happiness), and fish specially prepared to appear
live and swimming." <br>

York] 2004, Volume 2 (p. 189-90)

<font color="#8e2323"><b>Pork & Sauerkraut</b></font><br>
This is a German custom. Pennsylania Dutch, of German descent, also serve these foods.
<br>
 "Throughout history, the lowly cabbage has played side dish to the pig on New Year's Day, not
because it bears a special significance, but because it's a tasty complement to pork. "It's a
traditional combination," said William Weaver, an internationally known food historian who
lives in Chester County. Any Pennsylvania German worth his or her salt knows pork is served
on New Year's Day because it brings good luck. With their snouts, pigs root forward, signifying
progress, lore dictates, whereas chickens and turkeys scratch backward."<br>
---"Eat 'sour cabbage' for a sweet year; Having sauerkraut on New Year's Day brings luck,
some say," Kathleen Parrish, <i>Morning Call</i> [Allentown:PA], January 1, 2004 (p. A1)
<p>
"In the nineteenth century, sauerkraut was a cold-weather food. Sauerkraut with fresh pork was a
fall dish. Sauerkraut with turkey was a Christmas dish. And sauerkraut with pork was eaten for
good luck on New Year's Day, because, as the [Pennsylvania] Dutch say, "the pig roots
forward." Thus rooting forward into the new year, the Dutch ate sauerkraut with salt pork in the
late winter, and finally, sauerkraut with fish in early spring."<br>

We can thank our colonial era Dutch settlers for introducing New Years cookies to America. Sometimes called 
New Years Cakes, these thin crisp sugar cookies were traditionally flavored with caraway, lemon and sometimes cider.
Some recipes specify cutting the dough into fancy shapes, similar to <a href="christmasfood.html#cookies">Christmas cookies</a>.
Recipes for New Years cookies proliferate in the 1840s-1850s. By the late 1880s, they fade from the pages of "modern"
culinary literature.

<p>
"New Years Cakes were considered a delicacy most peculiar to New York and the Hudson Valley, but we do find professional bakers in many other East Coast
 cities advertising these cakes. A baker in Philadelphia advertised in 1840 that he "sells the real New York New Year's Cakes, the genuine Knickerbockers, of all 
sizes, from a cartwheel to a levenpenny bit...But how is it that New Years Cakes are also called Knickerbockers? We have already seen this term in connection 
with the olie-koecken...Yes, early Americans were sometimes confused about names, but at least this does tell us that people in the 1840s were well aware of the 
Dutch origins of this recipe." <br>

[NOTE: This book contains a modernized recipe based on one published by Eliza Leslie, circa 1838.] 
<p>
"New Year's Cake. This name is somewhat misleading. The ingredients, as [Eliza] Lea ordered them, make a stiff cookie that was once popular in Pennsylvania and 
Delaware under the name of apees cake. It is closely related tot he springerle but was sold by street vendors the year round. For rural Quakers, it was a special
 treat for children at New Year's, which may explain the name  Lea used for it. The cookie is not related to the crumb cake that is now sold under the name of apees
 in Berks County, Pennsylvania. More likely it was related to the New Year's cookies that were associalte with the Dutch settlers in Colonial New York. Those 
cookies were often stamped with elaborate carved mols. The leavening agent inthem was potash or pearl ash."<br>

"New Year's Cookies. Christmas and New Year's have always called for special recipes, and the Dutch New Year's koekjes, traditionally baked in molds that 
produced the design of an eagle or the name of a famous person like Washington, were once among the most ornate. In 1808, Washington Irving's Salmagundi: 
Or, The Whim-Whams and Opinions of Launcelot Langstaf, Esq., and Others claimed: "These notable cakes, hight [called] new-year cookies...originally were
 impressed one side with the burly countenance of the illustrious Rip [Van Winkle]."<br>

Early Americans welcomed the New Year with simple home receptions and neighborly visits.
As the Industrial Revolution progressed, and urban areas flourished, elaborate parties featuring theatrical presentations,
fancy decorations and complicated meals graced wealthy tables. By the dawn of the 20th century, trendy 
Americans rang in the New Year with hundreds of revelers and restaurant meals. Legal drinking curfews and Prohibition did not 
dampen the spririt. The Great Depression and war-time rationing were blissfully ignored on this day.
After WWII, home celebrations were rediscovered. Emphasis on convenient and easy, buffets gained favor
over sit-down meals. Brunches beat breakfast. What we learned? Every generation reflects on the "old ways" when embracing
new innovations.

The notes below reflect Ango-American New Year's food celebrations as reported in urban newspapers, popular cook books and
magazines. They <u>do not</u> address the diverse buffet of American New Year celebrations country-wide. Happy New Year from your friends at the <a href="http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodtimeline.org">Food Timeline</a>.

<font color="#8e2323"><b>Colonial American collations</b></font><br>
Many Colonial-era Americans greeted the New Year with collations, informal social gatherings
often held in "open" houses. This custom originated in New Netherlands (New York) and
quickly became popular in other parts of the country. Food and drink served reflected the
pocketbook of the host as well as the location of the home. Some concentrated on desserts and
light snacks; others offered elaborate and complicated menus.
Colonial/Early American cookbooks do not contain suggested menus/bills of fare for New Year's
Collations. What we know about these gatherings is gleaned from primary sources such as
journals, letters, household accounts, and newspaper articles. 
<p>

"The custom of paying New Year's calls originated in New York, where the Dutch held open
house on New Year's Day and served cherry bounce, olykoeks [doughnuts] steeped in rum,
cookies, and honey cakes. From New York the custom spread throughout the country. On the
first New Year's after his inauguration, George Washington opened his house to the public, and
he continued to receive visitors on New Year's Day throughout the seven years he lived in
Phildadelphia. On January 1, 1791, a senator from Pennsylvania hoted in his diary: "Made the
President the compliments of the season; had a hearty shake of the hand. I was asked to partake
of punch and cakes, but declined...Eventually, it became de rigeur [common social practice] for
those who intended to receive company to list in newspapers the hours they would be "at
home." It was a disastrous practice: parties of young men took to dashing from house to house
for a glass of punch, dropping in at as many of the homes listed in the papers as they could.
Strangers wandered in off the streets, newspapers under their arms, for a free drink and a bit of a
meal. The custom of having an open house on the first day of the year survived the assaults of
the newspaper readers. The traditional cookies and cakes continued to be served, along with hot
toddies, punches, eggnogs, tea, coffee, and chocolate. But public announcements of at-home
hours were dropped at the end of the nineteenth century, and houses were open only to invited
friends."<br>

"New Year's Eve was especially noisy, with the firing of guns to bring in the New Year.
Ordinances in both the Netherlands and New Netherland eventually prohibited such behavior.
The special treat for New Year's Day in the Netherlands was nieuwjaarskoeken (thick crisp
waters), which originated in the eastern part of the country and adjoining parts of Germany.
These wafers were made in a special wafer iron. The oblong or round long-handleed irons, made
by blacksmiths, created imprints of a religious or secular nature on the wafers. Wafer irons were
often given as a wedding gift, even in this country. Enormous quantities of wafers were
prepared on New Year's Day. The were consumed by family, servants, and guests distributed to
children, who went from house to house singing New Year songs, while collecting their share of
treats along the way. There is ample evidence in diaries and letters that Dutch Americans
continued the custom of visiting each other on New Year's Day. In New Netherland...the
nieuwjaarskoeken were molded in wooden cake-boards, instead of wafer irons...The American
New Year's cake is a combination of two Dutch pastries brought here by the early settlers, the

"In New York City, where it is the custom for ladies to remain at home to recieve the calls of their gentlemen friends, there is not time nor
occasion for dinners; should it be desirable, it would be similar to that for Christmas, or instead--a cold roasted turkey, 
(bone it if you can) cold boiled ham or tongue, a large glass salad-bowl of pickled oysters, or an oyster pie with dressed celery or
a chicken salad, with jelly puffs and tarts and small mince pies, blancmange, de russe and jellies and ice cream and fancy cakes, with
syrup water and orgeat or lemonade for temperance, or wines and punch. The manner of celebrating New Year's day by calls, is a
peculiarity of our own, and having so few which are 'native here,' many of our wisest and best, have wished that this might in no wise be slighted. Many a feud-divided
family have been united, and misunderstanding friends been brought together, under the all-pervading hospitality and genial influence which
distinguishes the day."<br>

Escaloped oysters; cold tongue, turkey, chicken, and ham, pressed meats, boned turkey, jellied chicken; salads, cold slaw garnished with fried oysters; bottled pickles, 
French or Spanish pickles; jellies; charlotte-russe, ice-creams, ices; two large handsome cakes for decoration of table, and one or two baskets of miced cake, fruit, layer, and

"A general and cordial reception of gentlemen guests upon the first day of the year, by the ladies of almost every household, also
by clergymen, and by gentlemen upon the first New-Year's Day after marriage, is a Knickerbocker custom which prevailed in New York, with scarce any
innovations, until within the last ten years. It was once a day when all gentlemen offered congratulations to each of their lady
acquaintences, and even employes of a gentleman were permitted to pay their respects, and to eat and drink with the ladies of
the household. Hospitalities were then lavishly offered and as lavishly received. This custom began when the city was small, but
it has now quite outgrown those possibilities which the original usages of the day could compass without difficulty. Beside, there
came a time when this excessive social freedom was proportionate to our over-large liberties, therefore, our hospitalities were
narrowed down to a lady's own circle of acquaintences. Even this boundary in many instances widened to so extended a 
circumference that not a few of our kindliest and most hospitable of ladies have been compelled either to close their doors upon
this day of hand-shaking, eating, and drinking, or else to issue cards of welcome to as many of their gentlemen acquaintences
as they can entertain in a single day. Not many ladies in New York are, however, placed upon such heights of popularity as to
make this limitation a genuine necessity, and others may choose to receive congratulations upon New-Year's-Day only from relatives
and intimate friends...ladies who recieve in a general way whoever choose to call upon them are now almost certain that the 
old-time crowds which thronged all open doors a decade ago will no longer intrude upon those from who they are uncertain even
of a recognition...to be considered a man of to-day, he must be well-bred and unobtrusive, even during this gala season...
Those who entertain elaborately upon New-Year's-Day sometimes send out cards of invitation...They are handsomely engraved...
Many gentlemen, even among those who take wine ordinarily, refuse it upon this day, 
because they do not like to accept it at the hand of one lady and refuse it from that of another. Again, many ladies, from whose
daily tables the glitter of wine-glasses is never absent, do not supply this drink to their guests upon this day, because it 
is dangerous for their acquaintences to partake of varied vintages, the more specially while passing in and out of over-heated
drawing rooms. Delicacies, coffee, chocolate, tea, and bouillon, are supplied in their places, whether the wines be withheld by
kindly considerateness, or through conscientious scruples."<br>

"When refreshments are provided for callers on this day, the tastes of gentlemen only are to be consulted, and it is understood taht they prefer rather
substantial dishes. Handsome decorations for the table are desirable. Hot coffee is a prime requisite. Sandwiches, salads, pickles, 
jellies, and three or four kinds of cold meats may be provided. Escaloped oysters are relishable. Two or three ornamented cakes for
decoration, and one or two baskets of mixed cake, will be needed, and such fresh fruits as can be obtained, including bananas, oranges, and
white grapes. Wine is no longer found upon the New Year's table in this latitude."<br>

real good old-fashioned time. The about 11.45 serve the supper, so that just before midnight all are ready with a toast to the new

room. The 12 o'clock is struck, turn on the lights and drink a Happy New Year. New Year merrymaking is as old as the history of

Saxon phrase 'Wasshael' means 'Your Health'; hence the wassail bowl. In many of the shires and counties the lads and lassies secure a large

"Records at the various hotels show that the reservations for tables are reaching the figures of pre-war days, and that out-of-town
 guests make up a goodly number of these reservations. The local merrymakers have not been overshadowed...After two years of dry law enforecment the people
of this country have at last got the stride of this new dry law tune and have not found it as bad as it might be. Just as last year and
the year before, liquor will be taboo. None will be sold in any of the big hotels. It is now an accepted fact that the eagle-eyed
dry agent is to be reckoned with, and it remains to be seen how many will brave this vigilance and 'carry their own' along.
It is generally known that the hotel employes cannot interfere with a patron's private supply which he has with him, but the ruling
as to the restrictions of the dry agents are not so well defined, and only the most courageous are willing to stand the consquences.
The hotel managers are all agreed that they will not permit their waiters to serve anything intoxicating. 'Oscar' of the

almost every home throughout the big Park Avenue apartment houses there will be a large private party. The Ritz-Carleton again

 will be served at $10 a cover at the Plaza, St. Regis, Pierre's Sherry's and the Ambassador."<br>

"The usual New Year's eve party that begins with dinner at 7, theater at 8:30, and dancing at 11, to be continued until morning, is 
bound to be a bore as well as a killer. If you have dinner early and go to the theater and then on somewhere to dance until 12 it is wise to disperse shortly after
midnight. If you are invited to such a party you are not a social flop if you leave before 1 o'clock. It is the proper thing to do. If you are invited for
ten o'clock that is a different matter and you may stay as long as you like--to breakfast if you are invited. In fact, some of the merriest 
New Year's eve parties are those which begin late and last until morning...On of my correspondents is entertaining her bridge club and their
husbands thus on New Years eve. As she has a small house she is serving on the bridge tables at twelve o'clock a nice supper of: Puree of 
Chestnuts, Celery and Olives, Turkey Patties, Green Peas, Julien Potatoes, Hot Rolls, Raspberry Ice and Vanilla Ice Cream, Coffee, 
Cake. She is also providing a breakfast of ham and eggs to be cooked by herself and some of the party on chafing dishes in the 
dining room, later on. If you take a party to the theater and which supper afterwards in a restaurant, it is wise on a crowded night
like New Year's eve to order it in advance when you reserve your table. A Restaurant Party. Home parties are much more fun, of 
course, than those in public places and, besides all the other things to recommend them, they may be made original and so

"Announcement that the curfew will not ring during the early hours of the new year sent shivers of delight along Broadway and Park avenue tonight. Hotel and nigh club operators promptly posted prices for what they predicted will be the highest and dizziest New Year's Eve celebration since the beginning of time, and let it be known that reservations are in order. Encouraged by the recent flurry of dividend checks and other bullish news, at least eight spots decided that $15 per person will be about right. For this nominal sum, the lucky patron will be permitted to sit at a table in a chair all his own, eat his supper, watch the entertianment and yell his head off when the zero hour approaches. In case he can't yell, he will find beside his plate an infernal machine that will bake all the noise he wants when agitated in the proper manner. Doubtless, he will be showered with confetti, at no extra charge. Of course, if he should thirst for anything stronger than water he may have at it, 
at the usual rates, over and above the initial $15. The more gluttonous citizens should be attracted by the offer of one restaurant in the 'frantic fifties' to serve supper and all-you-can-drink for $10."<br>

"It is a brand-new model of New Year's we are experiencing this year. We may approach it with apprehension, for we don't 
knwo what is around the curve for us, but that doesn't mean we should not gather our friends about us New Year's Even and 
sing 'Auld Lang Syne' and look forward to happier days...The kind of celebrating we do this New Year's will not mean 
formality and a lot of fancy food, but more old-time suppers, with guests helping themselves to something steaming, 
fragrant and delicious. You can't beat the buffet supper for ease of preparation and service and an assortment of food 
that will please all guests. These will be fruit punches, spiced cider, eggnog and other drinks at New Year's Day open 
houses, so why not try a an new beginning and have a tray holding glasses of hot vegetable punch?"<br>

"You need not mingle with the millions in order to have fun on New Year's Eve. A small party at home with close friends can be far more enjoyable than an evening spent
buffeted around by strangers and uninhibited pranksters. Twelve people is a good number, one for each month of the New Year. Whe old friends gather, there is no need to 
plan entertainment, for time just seems to whick away, 'doin' what comes naturally'--singing, dancing or just talking and reminiscing. And suddenly it is midnight, time for
Auld Lang Syne , and supper. If you have the perfect combination of 12 people and a large, round table, set that table to resemble a huge clock, with one guset seated at each 
marked hour, and two large paper hands indicating the hour. Lacking this, make a timely centerpiece...Use little hourglass egg timers, also from the blessed ten cent store, for
favors, and have each guest's name lettered on a bright and shining leaf for a place card. On the reverse side, the message, 'You have just turned over a new leaf!' And here is a menu
that can be prepared ahead of thiem and ready for last minute assembling. It is simple, yet hearty, for New Year's Eve is 
one evening when midnight supper really is a supper.<br>

"New Yorkers who go out to greet the New Year will be able to choose settings that range from dancing to the music of Guy Lombardo in the main concourse of Grand Central Terminal to a beer at the corner bar. Most places offerng entertainment or dancing on New Year's Eve will impose a cover charge or a a minimum, which usually can be devoted to food or drinks. The minimum in some cases constitutes a s charge for a complete meal but does not include liquor. In these instances the menu is usually diesignated in advance. Celebrants are most apt to find themselves 
eating filet mignon or roast beef but if they wish drinks they can choose their own weapons. The main concourse of Grand Central Terminal will be turned into a ballroom for the first time for the Bell Ringer Ball for Mental Health, a benefit for the National Associaton of Mental Health.

"Tradition dies hard in many homes, particularly around the holidays. Many families wouldn't think of greeting the new year without a steaming pot of oyster stew. 
Their parents always did, and so did their grandparents. Others wouldn't dream of bidding goodbye to the old year and welcoming in the new without sharing a bowl
 of black-eyed peas with friends...Traditional foods crop up in surprising places during holiday celebrations. But there's one thing that should be noted about these
 culinary traditions. Most of the foods involved tend to be plebian, abut not pedestrian. They're simple dishes--hearty and filling and loaded with good, gutsy flavor. By today's
standards, some such as oyster stew, aren't cheap. But if you were brought up to expect a hot bowl of this rich soup-stew on New Year's Day, the expense will
just have to be endured."<br>

"What to have for New Year's Eve Dinner is sure to be a dilemma. Although Jan. 1 does not begin the new year for all people in the world, a dinner reflecting the food choices of a 
different nationality can be interesting and fun to prepare. Chinese or Japanese cuisine offers many creative and quick-to-prepare dishes. With the aid of a wok, bean 
sprouts, mung shoots, peapods and other Chinese vegetables, combined with chicken, steak or pork, and seasoned with tabasco or soy sauce, can be stir-fried in minutes....
For those who prefer a meal that sits a little longer in the stomach, Italy offers dishes that are both delicious and filling. Lasagna, Italian bread and a salad are sure to pelase everyone. 
Add a piece of cheesecake or a cannoli as dessert, and the menu is complete. From 'south of the border' come menu ideas that are reminders of the sunny, 'hot' climate
of Mexico. Tacos, cornbread, enchiladas and guacamole can add the spice of life to a dinner."<br>

"Windows on the World. Spectacular settings rarely signify spectacular food, and that is unfortunately true in this...However, they can all be relied on for something decent, if you order
carefully. If a special setting is needed for yourself or your guests (especially if they are from out of town), you might well consider one of them. On a clear day, you can see almost
to 1983 from Windows on the World, the gorgeous restaurant on the 107th floor of 1 World Trade Center (938-1111; open noon to 2:30PM). Surely, the view's the thing, and to take it 
in, you might consider it worth the effort to pick your way carefully through the buffet offerings. There are some good quality selections, but they are fleshed out with delicatessen-type
salads and meats. If you bypass some of the obvious fillers and stick to herrings, soused shrimp, some of the cold fish specialties and such hot dishes as chicken hash James 
Beard and loin of pork stuffed with prunes, and then have some chocolate cake or lemon tart, you should feel as though you had fair value for $17.95. Service is

"Our New Year's Eve dinners are a microcosim of the evolution in American dining, though from time to time my co-host puts her foot down at what she consideres my avant-guard ideas.
When I suggested that this year we serve diner food--meatloaf and mashed poatotoes--she suggested that I had taken leave of my senses. It was hardly a suggestion, I would hav
made, even in jest, in the early 1970's, a time when a formal meal was incomplete without beef and six courses. In 1971, we were all avid followers of Julia Child. nodish for the 
all-French menu that year was too time-consuming, so the first course was quenelles of sole with sauce Nantua...For the main course we served filet of beef with sauce Bernaise. It was not until
1975 that we dared to serve rockfish en papilllote as an entree, and we agonized over it for weeks. It's hard to remember, but not everyone ate fish then...By 1979, the winds of change were alread
evident. Food was becoming lighter, and an occasional non-French dish turned up on the menu. We even served chicken, albeit breasts stuffed with fresh truffles. The carrots were
pureed in keeping with the nouvelle cuisine influence, but we gave them a slightly exotic twist with a but of cumin. Creme fraiche had entred our lives--the homemade version 
created with buttermilk and cream. It accompanied our first American dish--zucchini pancakes--one of the earliest signs, I think, of the coming revolution."<br>

"It is 6 PM on December 31, 1999, and guests are arriving for the last party of the 20th century. We expect to usher in the New Year with gusto and anticipation. 
However, there is some trepidation, some Y2K fear aroused within us. Our host, Sammy Cyberhunter, greets us looking poised and relaxed. How can that be? 
What about all of the organizing, shopping, and slaving over a hot stove to prepare for tonight's celebration? How can Sammy seem so calm? ..."Excuse Me, but 
Could I Get You Something to Drink?" Perhaps a glass of Chardonnay. We have a great Kendall Jackson 1997 Grand Reserve.....
 Maybe you would prefer a soft drink, a Kir Royale or a Perrier with lime?" I inquire about red wine and choose a Willamette Valley, Oregon Pinot Noir 
,,,. The nose is fresh and slightly fruity, but with just enough body to stand up to a discussion of Y2K, a situation created by the forerunners of 
today's Internet computer nerds. The World Wide Web assists the consumer in the search for wine with particular characteristics from thousands of wineries around
 the world. The history of alcoholic beverage sales imposes, and continues to impose, restrictions, such as the "three-tier-law," between vintners and consumers.
 Leaders in the online sales of wine have blazed trails and continue to endure law suits, which they hope will simplify national and international sales of wine on the 
Web. Virtual Vineyards...and others...sell a large selection of wines. Wine Search Online 
...provides a comprehensive directory of online wine merchants. New wine sites go live every month. A much smaller list of 
wineries such as Kendall-Jackson...and Rutherford Hill...sell their own wines directly online..
."Hors d'Oeuvres, Anyone?" NewYear's Eve is not for worriers; we turn our attention from Y2K to aromas and flavors that excite the palate and satiate the soul. A
 selection of delectable appetizers appears: portabello mushrooms in filo triangles..., cognac pate
 with water chestnuts and celery..., and bacon-wrapped scallops
 .... I choose foie gras on a wheat cracker topped with a skosh of white truffle paste...in porcini
 mush-room-infused olive oil. Gourmet ingredients and prepared foods abound on the Web. While a comprehensive discourse on the sourcing of foodstuffs is 
beyond the scope of this article, suffice it to say that Web search engines yield a plethora of manufacturers/producers, distributors, and retailers of gourmet
 ingredients. Searching for foie gras locates the nationally acclaimed D'Artagnan...and other U.S. and international suppliers. While at 
D'Artagnan, you might want to order a few "French Kisses" -- after all it is New Year's Eve. These sinful morsels are prunes marinated in Armagnac and stuffed
 with foie gras mousse. Your menu might require a fresh seafood supplier. Many reside on the Web. Seafood can be ordered from the companies that catch it, 
such as lobsters from The Lobster Net...in South Carolina. However, you can also order seafood from a distributor or retailer such 
as Fisher Seafood Company.... Whether you search for fish, beef, or popcorn, bookmark the Food Web
 ..., a cornucopia of links to great producers, distributors, wholesalers, and retailers of food products and gourmet ingredients....If you 
worry about the lights failing after midnight, you might even order a supply of Millennium Candies from ...."Dinner Is Served!" The
 person to my right marvels that Sammy seemed not to spend any time in his kitchen for final preparations. How could that be? We have each received a 
Millennium Menu Card describing the meal, with three choices for the main course. The Amuse Bouches arrives -- a fried potato trellis about the size of clam shell, 
topped with a refreshing Ahi Tuna...ceviche and a drizzle of white truffle oil.... 
Appetizers continue the elegance. The vegetarians among us are offered a vegetable pate...served on a bed of greens and
 topped with a soupcon of jalapeno compote. I choose the foie gras...served in three layers, separated by thin slices of fresh plum
 .... To cleanse our palates, Sammy serves a demitasse of raspberry sorbet, prepared in his Cuisinart Ice-Cream Maker
 .... The main course arrives. The guest seated next to me has chosen the Seared Day Boat Sea Scallops with Saffron
 Risotto and Lemon-Tarragon Broth.... In keeping with the exquisite decadence of our millennium celebration, I have selected roast
 duck...with a sun-dried cherry and port wine sauce. The duck is cooked to perfection. For the vegetarians, Sammy
 has a pumpkin risotto with walnuts and shaved truffle...added at the table. The dinner wines pair perfectly with our food.
 I am having a 1992 Duckhorn Merlot...with my main course. The foodies among us recognize Balducci's as a high-quality New York city 
marketer selling fresh produce, cheeses, meats, and prepared food. Our host ordered the Roast Duck with Cherry Port Sauce from..., 
completing final preparations at home. To assure the reception of high-quality truffles (worthy of their high price), Sammy wisely ordered them online from
 ..., where only the best of the best mushrooms and truffles are sold. Now we can choose a cheese course
 ...or a light Valrhona chocolate...mousse with ginger cream. Coffee, cappuccino, and espresso 
round out the meal...Now 11:30 PM and Sammy passes around a large tray of Beluga caviar..., accompanied by mother-of-pearl 
serving spoons. I prepare my cracker with a sliver of red onion and a tad of sour cream before adding the caviar. So succulent and sensual -- how wonderful to 
gird our loins for the millennium with such decadent fare. This is a New Year's Eve, the like of which none of us will ever see again. Our host makes a brief 
announcement to thank us for coming and prepares the champagne to toast away the last thousand years and look forward to the next thousand. Bottles of 
exquisite Tattinger Comtes de Champagne...lie on ice. At five minutes to midnight, we uncork the bottles in anticipation. Glasses rise in the air.
 As the clock strikes twelve, hugs, handshakes, kisses, and New Year's wishes accompany the champagne along with more caviar...The festivities wind down and 
we prepare to head home. Whether the cars and the traffic lights still work, we won't know until the clocks strike twelve on the Millennium Night."<br>

<br>

"Calculated on a lunar calendar, it is New Year's that evokes the greatest celebrations  in Chinese life. Celebrated on the first day of the first month with dragon-led
 parades, incense and fireworks and banners of red everywhere (signifying good luck), New Year's is traditionally usred in by family feasting...New Year's is 
celebrated for the first fifteen days of the new year, especially for agrarian families who take this period as the opportunity for an annual rest as well as for visiting, 
feasting, and wearing new clothes...In ancient times during the New Year's period, palace dignitaries were presented with purses embroidered with eight Buddhist
 symbols called "Eight Treasures," which they proudly hung on their chests. In more recent times this is recalled by the serving of a fruit-fuilled rice pudding called 
Eight Treasures rice pudding. Customary too at this time is the setting around the room small bowls of lichees and longans, platters of steamed rice cakes and 
jujubes (red for luck), and salted seeds. During the festive dinner itself, red sweet-and-sour sauce is sure to be part of at least one dish, be it pork or fish. This is
 also the time to give the "Kitchen God" some sticky sweets so he won't give a bad report on the family."<br>
---<i>You Eat What You Are: People, Culture and Food Traditions</i>, Thelma Barer-Stein [Firefly Books:Ontario] 1999(p. 100)
<p>
"Why do so many Chinese regard New Year celebrations with such delight? We think it is due to a combination of circumstances, among which food is very 
important. Besides good food there are many other ingredients: (1) a real sense of family togetherness and of the good life, (2) holidays (plenty of rest and fun), (3)
 new clothes, (4) ritual fanfare to ancestral spirits, and (5) general festivity. During this celebration, food is not important for the living alone: a large part of the ritual
 fanfare to ancestral spirits consists of fancy food and drink (tea and alcohol) offerings...For weeks before the New Year, women in every northern Chinese home 
are busy making meat dumplings called chiao tzu. These consists of a filling of chopped pork and cabbage, salt, ginger, scallions, and ground white and black 
pepper, wrapped in a thin skin of dough. In a large household the number of dumplings may run into the thousands...But pork and cabbage dumpling...are only part
 of the New year fare. many northern Chinese households make wine, bean curd, and sausages and slaughter a pig or two for home consumption...For days before
 New Year's Eve, regular stores in towns and cities are supplemented by temporary markets with hundreds of trading stands...When the shopping is done, the 
celebration begins with New Year's Eve dinner. This dinner begins in late afternoon (five o'clock) and is usually sumptuous. Even among the relatively poor, it would
 include four to six big bowls...featuring vegetables (chiefly cabbage, turnips, and dried musrhooms), chicken, fish, mussels, and especially pork. For the better-off 
families, there would definitely be eight big bowls...preceded by four or six cold plates and followed by one or two "big items"...In the cold plates are pickles, sliced
 cold meat, pigs'-feet jelly, roasted peanuts, thin-sliced jellyfish skin in vinegar and soy sauce, sugar-preserved green apricots or kumquats, or salted dried shrimp
 with peas, and so on. In the eight big bowls are...also such delicacies as sea cucumbers, sharks' fins, birds' nests, pork sausages, ham, giant pork
 meatballs...termed 'lions' heads', with cabbage, and fresh and dried shrimp. One of the big items usually is 'eight precious rice,' a sweet production of sticky rice
 mixed with eight other ingredients including lotus seeds, almond seeds, sliced red dates, several kinds of candied fruits, sweet bean paste, and brown-sugar syrup.
 In addition, there is usually a fancy,s weet soup, such as that made with white tree ears (a kind of edible fungus) and crystal sugar, which comes after the other 
dishes. White rice and wine or spirits are served with the entire meal...This feast is the opener. Beginning with New Year's Day, quite a few other sumptuous meals
 for members of each household and for visiting relatives and friends follow. Snacks in the form of watermelon seeds, sesame candy and other sweets, roasted 
peanuts, fruits such as pears and oranges, and cakes are available at all times. Visitors are served tea, watermelon seeds, and sweets as soon as they sit down...At
 this time...each child, up to the age of fifteen, is given a candle in the shape of his or her own birth animal made of mung-bean dough filled with candle wax and a 
wick."<br>

"One period when food is offered to the Kitchen God is that of the Chinese New Year. Several days before that date, the Kitchen God is given a farewell dinner, 
by only of sweets, such as sweet rice, cake, and candied fruit. In addition, his lips are sealed with sticky sweets, such as honey, molasses, or sugar candy, in the 
further hope that he will say only sweet things when he visits Yu Huang...the "Jade Emperor" or supreme Taoist god, to give his annual accounting of family affairs. 
Then the represenation of the Kitchen God is removed and burned, along with spirit-money and other things to use on his journey,  and he is sent on his way, 
accompanied by the sound of firecrackers. A new representative of the Kitchen God is set up several days later, on New Year's Eve, when his return is celebrated
 with firecrackers and he shares food and other offerings with the family ancestral spirits and other deities, and once again presides over the family hearth."<br>

"Traditions vary from region to region in China and, as in the United States, from family to family. The Wang family traditionally eats a huge noon meal on the day 
before Chinese New Year. Because Chinese believe even numbers are lucky, there will be an even number of dishes, usually 12, with four cold dishes and eight hot 
ones. Some of the family favorites include cold sausage, cooked pork skin, peanuts and a salad made of finely shredded cucumber and vermicelli. The hot dishes 
will include different vegetables stir- fried with pork, mutton stir-fried with green onions (scallions) and a fish dish. Because the Chinese word for fish is a homonym
 for "plenty," no family will celebrate the holiday without a fish dish. There is always much more food on the table than the Wangs can eat, but the idea is to have a
 large spread to signify the hoped-for abundance in the coming year. In northern China, the most important meal is the fresh dumpling dinner at midnight. After 
setting off firecrackers to scare away evil spirits, the family will throw open their front door to welcome in the God of Wealth. Wang's father and mother, as the 
senior members of the family, will then pass out "red packets," of money to their grandchildren. Only then will the Wangs sit down to bowls of rice piled high with
 jiao zhi, or boiled meat-and-vegetable-filled dumplings. The dumplings are supposed to represent prosperity and riches because they are the same shape as yuan 
bao, a gold or silver ingot that was used as money in ancient China. Their rounded shape also represents unity, and eating them symbolizes the reunion of the family.
 Inside one of the dumplings will be a coin. "Whoever eats that dumpling will be blessed with special good fortune in the new year," said Wang. But just as fortunate 
are the cooks in the family: The days before the festival are spent in front of the chopping board and the stove because one of the important traditions surrounding 
this ancient festival is that no one is supposed to cook during the first several days of the new year."<br>
